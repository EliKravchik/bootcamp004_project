0,Julie B,"My 30-year-old self appreciated it a heck of a lot more than my 17-year-old self. (I reread it in anticipation of seeing the movie.)I’m haunted by the timeless nature of the themes in this story (adultery, distinct class differences, the American dream, old money, new money). I cannot stop thinking about Myrtle and Daisy. The voluptuous, stubborn, blue-collar adulteress versus the frivolous, wispy, waspy, fickle, dreamer, Daisy (also an adulteress). How they each end up feels so unfair to me and yet so believable. I keep going back to this quote:“She had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and perseveres, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor” (150).I’m also left thinking a lot about the servants mentioned subtly throughout the piece, as Gatsby’s lavish lifestyle is detailed. “Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York — every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler’s thumb” (39-40).During a time when there is a strong political focus on the 1% versus the 99%, and the masses are crazed by Downton Abbey, the making of another film about this enduring classic is pretty appropriate. I wan't expecting to fall in love with this book so much—in such an aching way."
1,Alys,"I read this book twice, at 26 and and 47. I loved it both times but understood it so much better on the second reading."
2,Léa,"How can I even begin to explain this book and its affect on me. I love the story, the narrative is so beautiful, the characters are really deep, even the ending is amazing, and it has my favourite last line of all the books I’ve read. But it’s not my favourite book? Why? Well, it could be that it could never top the brilliance and genius of The Picture of Dorian Gray but also because I feel it lacks something.Don’t get me wrong, it had everything it needed. It’s a short but engaging novella about the trials of dreams and the realisation of those dreams, it really spoke to me. But, I can’t help but think that somewhere something was lost. Or maybe that’s the effect the writer was going for. Maybe we’re meant to feel like Gatsby…like we finished the book, and it was a good book, but maybe it wasn’t everything we wanted it to be. If that’s the case, it is the most amazing stunt in all of literature and if it’s an accident then it’s an amazing accident.It’s told from the view of Nick Carraway who is sort of outside of the story but also involved in the story and tell the story of Jay Gatsby (who likes parties) and his pursuit of a relationship with Daisy Buchanan (Nick’s cousin) much to the dislike of her husband, Tom (who is also cheating on her…men, eh?)I can’t do it justice so you’ll just have to read it. Read it now. READ IT."
3,Matthew Ryan,"The Great Gatsby was a book that I did not want to put down. The complex and sometimes confounding imagery that was used in this book really portrayed the brilliance of Fitzgerald. My three take-aways from this particular book would be the importance of imagery and euphemism and how authors use it to foreshadow the plot, the effect your socioeconomic class has on your work ethic and motivation in the world, and finally, the importance of not dwelling in the past, but rather focusing on what is ahead. Ultimately, I found this book obtained a great moral of not being capable to relive the past and how we are only capable of controlling our futures. Overall, I would undoubtedly recommend this book to anyone who comes across it. "

But if I had that sentence memorized after reading it one time then it must truly resonant with me. Over the last 24 hours I've attempted to recall the last sentence of books I call ""favorites"" and I can't. How they ended, sure, no problem. Word for word the last sentence, not a single one.I haven't really had time to analyze the book beyond my gut reaction of ""Wow!"" What stands out the most, right now, aside from the above, is the imagery and the characterization. An example of the former, ""At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses (p.28)."" As to the latter, the fact that I absolutely loathe certain characters *coughDaisycough* means they were alive in my imagination, jumped off the page, so to speak. Can't really do that if they're cardboard cut-outs or 2D. Definitely earns it's ""classic"" label. I foresee annual re-reads of this one."
5,Carter McKeon,"I really enjoyed The Great Gatsby and it showed me a lot about the true nature of some people. After reading The Great Gatsby, I have three crucial takeaways: where you are from shapes who you are as a person, the people you surround yourself with shapes you as a person, and wealth does not make you happy. Throughout the entirety of the novel, we are presented with different characters from different parts of the United States and even different parts of New York, the West Egg and the East Egg. Nick, as a westerner in the East, claims to be one of the few honest people.Your friends shape who you are and that is evident when it comes time for Gatsby's funeral. When Gatsby threw a giant party, there was an inexhaustible amount of guests, but when it came time to attend his funeral and show homage to his life, no friends could make the trip.Wealth is apparent in almost every character we meet in The Great Gatsby, and yet the majority of the characters are unhappy, either with their lives or their marriage. This could be symbolic of Fitzgerald's own life. He was a famous celebrity married to a beautiful women, yet they were both unhappy and couldn't maintain a happy marriage."
6,Kevin Zielinski,"The Great Gatsby is often considered Fitzgerald's greatest work and while I can't speak to that, I can say that it is indeed quite the literary gem. Merely reading of the superfluous extravagance portrayed within the upscale neighborhoods that serve as the novels setting is enough to evoke an awe inspired lust from the reader. The minuscule details Fitzgerald uses in the way in which he chooses to express these enormous scenes is what brings them to a level that is larger than life. These places and the story they encompass serve as the metaphorical basis for the novel, they are exemplary of man's incessant desire for more, the tantalizing want that can never be quenched because its very existence is what keeps man moving in a direction. This desire is the foundation for Gatsby's character, a man so consumed by his want that he goes to the moon and back just to grasp it, composing a bittersweet tale of a man who can never have what he wants because he always wants more than he has. But more than that is a novel of an inspiring man whose story has us believe that man is not limited by anything more than his imagination. It is an American novel that shows us that a James Gatz can become a Jay Gatsby.
""Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever...His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.""

7,Loren Orts,I loved loved this book! I had no issue reading it in one morning. I definitely will be rereading this every few years.
8,Roland Perreault,"I have to re-read this book every few years. This time round, I enjoyed the dinner time discussions with my daughter Rebecca who is reading this book for her high school literature class. We had some really deep discussions about it. One of my favorites of all time."
9,Steff,"This book made me cry, I have never felt so connected to a character the way that I had to Gatsby and Fitzgerald put gatsby through hell.I found Nick to be a calming voice, one that saw everything, connected with everything and most of all he had the ability to tell a story with thoughts, and opinions of a real person. It was just so easy to like Nick that you weren't really bothered to see the story through his eyes.I found Jordan to be a coward and it was precisely this quality that Nick disliked. She wasn't a friend, she was a hanger-on.I hated Tom from the beginning which made me love Gatsby even more. It was obvious Tom wanted what he couldnt have, just like so much of the people around us.I kept trying to find a way to like Daisy and, though I hate to admit it, I did after she cried after seeing Gatsby. I thought that she genuinely loved him but Daisy was only in love with the money, with the illusion she lived in. Gatsby saw this but he couldn't help loving her.My heart broke several times during this book, when I saw Gatsby's eagerness for Daisy, when he proclaimed that Daisy wouldn't leave Tom for him, when Gatsby met Tom and when it was clear to us all that Tom was right (Daisy was just amusing herself with Gatsby), when he spent the night outside her window and then went home alone, when he tried to convince himself that she would call him but she never did. Gatsby was like so many of us living for his past, wanting to just it so badly that he spent five years accumulating enough wealth for Daisy. He felt unworthy but the truth is that Daisy would've never deserved Gatsby. My hearts was shattered when Gatsby died. He didn't deserve death. In truth, I believed him to be a sad man who had believed in something that was just an illusion. I liked the bit with mr. Gatz, he showed Gatsby in a way I suspected him to be the entire book but never got to see. In life he had so many friends, everyone wanted to be around him but in death there was no one but two.In short the wealthy always win because they have this safe little bubble to return to. A little bit of hope can kill a man. Looking back at your past is no way to build a future. People will always use you for what they can get out of you but will never be there for you in the end. My fave point would be that Daisy is a BITCH (there's a lot more profanities I would like to use to describe her but I have to restrain myself remembering that she is just a character). My heart bleeds for Gatsby (the character and man I had come to enjoy unravelling, the man who loved to much, the man who lived in the past, the man with no friends living on false hope given to him from a life that has ceased to exist but one that he cannot forget). I wish things turned out differently for him.A beautiful book, easy to read and an undeniable must read.***an after-thought***I keep feeling like I missed some great revelation that Fitzgerald was trying to impart. So, I thought I would add some more of my thoughts.I think that Gatsby never really loved Daisy but lusted after what she represented. We know that Gatsby had come from an improvised background and when he initially wanted Daisy it was because of the other men that lusted after her. We know that she should him a world that he never really belonged to and had no way of gaining entrance on his own. Sure, Daisy was charming but she was as fickle as they come and I find it hard to believe that a man of Gatsby's character would set his attention wholly on her when it was clear he could've had anyone. But, here is where the problem arises, she was a challenge and would not have him because he didn't have a fortune (keep in mind, that this was never said by Daisy). He built up his fortune to get her even after she had married (still presenting a challenge). It's true, men love a good hunt, it's in their nature.He emerged himself into her world (with the wealthy), trying gain acceptance looking for a place to belong. But he didn't belong, he always felt like an outsider so he never joined but always observed, looking for his key to this world (Daisy). He said it himself when he compared her voice to money, he saw her as the unattainable last piece to achieving his higher status in life. Maybe, at some point he did fall for her (just a little bit) but I believe it was the illusion of her, of finally ""making it"" in life that ultimately became an obsession. The human mind is powerful thing especially with a seed of hope, Gatsby died with that hope. He was a man that was alone in the world even in death. Power and money was everything in this world.I would also like to point out that Daisy did not care if Tom cheated on her, only that it caused her embarrassed her. They too lived in an illusion. Nicky's voice was calming, I loved his loyalty, especially at the end. Gatsby did gain something in this book but he was to blind to realize it, he gained a true friend.I also found it shocking when my friend pointed out that the woman in the book were weak, but I did not feel that way. Daisy was a strong character, all her decisions were made by herself including the one to stay with the money. If she was weak she would have been manipulated and not have exploited Gatsby's feelings in the manner that she did. It just shows you that guys don't know when a woman is pulling the strings (this friend was a guy)."
10,Stephanie Ricketts, One of my favorite books and one I love teaching to my year 13 students. It is a short read but every single page is flooded with symbolic meaning. I also love how every character and setting is used to show the corruption of the American dream.
11,Veronica The Geek,"He believed in the green light, he believed in chasing the past that had been lost a long time ago...... The Great Gatsby is one of those books that will leave you with an empty, hollow sort of feeling. It's my first time reading this book and I'm totally in love with it; Sir F. Scott Fitzgerald's beautiful, poetic writing, the irony and the cruelty of the plot and the flaws of its characters and all those brilliant quotes have totally captured me from the first page and kept me turning pages. It's certainly a quick read that everyone should try at least once.....Love, love, love. It's a wonderful....the most beautiful thing, which is at the same time, the most terrible. You love too much, you get burned. And Jay Gatsby you old sport, you fell too deep in love and look at where it'd landed you. It's just not fair! But then it's life; and life is never fair...I understand that Fitzgerald's writing is a complex piece of art and that there are certainly things I had failed to understand in my first read. I actually saw the movie first and I quite liked it so I decided, ""Why not read it?!"". Turned out I absolutely loved this book. And I hated the cruelty of it. I felt happy and sad for Gatsby. I felt angry at the ignorance and selfishness of the humans. I was disgusted, revolted of the ugly truth of the world we live in. The narrator, Nick Carraway is an interesting person as well. He was just an ordinary person minding his own business until he got himself tangled with the mess of the rich. He's the only quiet, selfless character who think and reason carefully compared to the rest of the shallow rich, spoiled characters. He got into their mess too deep to even remember his own 30th birthday. Oh, Nick you poor thing. Nick is also dramatic and poetic. He said such smart and funny things as well making his narratation interesting. One of my favourite quotes of his would be the one he said in the first page of the book-""Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had"", Nick has said. I know, Nick. I do. But people will be the way people are. They judge. That's what people do. The Great Gatsby, for me, is not your average love story. I actually see it as the story of a man who fell in love. It featured so many wonderful and horrible themes of the Jazz age throughout the book; racism, adultery, greed, hatred, love, parties and all those beauty and ugliness of the people.The lesson I've learned from the story?Some things are better left in the past. What's done is done and there are things you can't do anything about. One shouldn't be obssessed over things that are lost or out of bounds. And Gatsby, poor Gatsby, went too far to chase the green light and got himself tangled up in his past dream that was lost. It was chaotic. The ending was not beautiful. Gatsby was too in love to let Daisy go, had tried to win her back when she was clearly out of his limits. He tried and worked too hard and became a multimillionaire in a short time so that she would notice him. He did everything just for her, the girl whose voice was 'full of money'. Gatsby had thought that money would solve everything. But that was before everything he had built fell apart ,and he ended up with a bullet in his body. He was a great soul who just didn't deserve this tragic ending. And it made me so furious that no one, not even that bloody Daisy, cared to send a single bloody flower, let alone came to his funeral. He did it for her! Sacraficed everything for the woman he felt 'married-to'. It was him who had looked at her the way all the women in the world want to be looked at. He took the blame instead beacuse he loved her. He had died believing that she loved him too. But did Daisy even care? No. ""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy-they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made."" And there you were right again,Nick. In the end there was only Nick. Only he stuck with Gatsby till the end. Only Nick stood by him when there was no one else who cared enough for Gatsby to come to his funeral; the very same man whose hospitality and generousity they took advantaged of, the man whose great, grand parties they crashed every weekends. It is really disgusting and sad to know that there are actually people like those who only care about you as long as you're of any use to them. Wow, the world is such a cruel, cold place if you think about it. People are blinded by greed and selfishness and messed up between delusions and reality, the bad is outbalancing the good and everyday the number of good and trustworthy people grow smaller and smaller....The Great Gatsby is more than just a fiction. It's truth. It tells so much about life. It's both beautiful and ugly. It's both wonderful and tragic. It's both sweet and bitter. It is definitly one of the best books ever written and one of those books that I shall cherish in my heart for a long time. Thank you Sir Fitzgerald."
12,Danny Perry,"I read this in High School, and then just re-read it last week (it's pretty short).While I don't feel I'm entirely authoritative on early 20th century literature, I think this is an extremely well written book. It's the kind of book that makes you want to become a writer, because he makes it look so easy. It looks like he would have had to work and sweat over every paragraph.. you get things like:As I went over to say good-by I saw that the expression ofbewilderment had come back into Gatsby's face, as though a faint doubthad occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness.Almost five years! There must have been moments even that afternoonwhen Daisy tumbled short of his dreams - not through her own fault,but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gonebeyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with acreative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with everybright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshnesscan challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.Which is not only stunning in the words selected to convey the thought, but also surprisingly accurate in describing a human trait of building someone up when you have a ""crush"" on them.The book is chuck full of paragraphs like that.Anyway, in my opinion its a brilliant book, one I wouldn't mind reading again and again."
13,Jessica B,"This review was originally posted at my (now dead) book blog shutupimreading.blogspot.com. My current blog is thebillcosbysweater.wordpress.comI should make an effort to read more beloved/hated classics. Not only do I feel literary and superior while reading them, but every so often I find a new love. This was the case with The Great Gatsby.The Great Gatsby is told through the eyes and mind of Mr. Nick Carraway, a mild-mannered businessman that spent some time in Long Island, New York in the 20's. He bought himself an ordinary house that just happened to be right next door to Gatsby, a man that leads a life that is anything-but-ordinary. Then Nick's cousin Daisy comes into the picture and she's a terrible person and so is her husband, etc. I'm sure you've heard the rest, and if not then I won't spoil it for you. Suffice it to say that things transpire and bonds and morals are tested.Nick's character didn't interest me much but I still found myself completely involved in his story. Even in the slow beginning when he was only talking about his past and Long Island and having boring and sometimes racist (thanks to that lovely gem of a man Tom) conversations with Daisy and Tom. Then Gatsby came in and I was HOOKED because I love it when characters have mysteries surrounding them.But I hate it when characters are metaphors for things. Well, usually, because in this case I actually thought it worked. I can totally see Gatsby being a metaphor for the American dream and it doesn't bother me because he still felt like a full character.What really made this book work for me, though, was Fitzgerald's writing. That writing that is so stupid-good that, as an aspiring writer, made me want to sing from the rooftops with joy that I have discovered it...and also bang my head against a table with woe because I will never be as good as this man.I should also mention that I listened to The Great Gatsby on audiobook and it was a pretty great experience. Frank Muller has the classic sort of voice that makes it seem like he was narrating this story with a pipe in one hand as he sat next to a fire in a robe.I definitely had my reservations before going into Fitzgerald's most popular novel The Great Gatsby, but I shouldn't have worried because I kinda loved it. Definitely recommended to people that want to read more classics but don't know where to start, because it's less than 200 pages and it's very very good.Plot: Like a mild soap opera and I loved it.Characters: I loved some. Hated others.Writing: SO GOOD.Ending: Um, the audio started to skip so it kinda ruined the shock factor a little. It was still good.Content: Some swearing and mentions of sex as well as death and drinking and such.Overall:Shut up I am listening to a great audiobook.I didn't expect to like this one very much but I really did. I need more of Fitzgerald's writing in my life."
14,gabrielle,"Absolutely exceptional. I divided into the unknowing world of rich and extravagant people, who look like a shiny piece of glass on the outside but bare decades of cracks. I loved the point of veiw of Nick Carroway, who seemed like the only sane person in the book. I advise you to take your time while reading, for there are many hidden details. "
15,Sahina Bibi,"Venturing today back into my vault of reviews to write one up for one of my favourite books. I didn’t stumble across this marvel, nor did I pick it up on a whim, but rather it was part of my A-Level reading requirement for English Literature at school. It was a daunting book for me at first, because of course the first time we read it, we allocated parts and characters to one another and had to do class readings - let’s not even get into the horror of that. The beauty of this book was lost on me during then, it was only after I left school that I took it upon myself to re-read it during university (since so aptly around that time, the movie was out featuring Leonardo DiCaprio). I’m one of those types, who likes to read a book before watching a movie, so that’s exactly what I did. Where am I going with this I hear you ask? Ha! Like you even need to ask at this point, as if my insane ramblings are something new to you *vigorous eye roll* but for your sake I will move on to the review :D The Great Gatsby is an absolute classic and I don’t even like classics, but I love this story. The one thing that stood out to me during my A-Levels and even after that when I read it for pleasure, was the symbolism, the motifs and brilliant metaphors that littered the story and to this day, the metaphor about the green light remains one of my absolute favourite. When this book strikes you, and trust me, if you take your time to read it, it will strike you, and you’ll be left clutching this book to your chest and breathing heavily. The characters are a spectrum of their own - that is to say some characters I loved so freaking much, whilst others I wanted to torch down whilst laughing gleefully; if you’ve read this, it won’t be too hard to figure out which end Gatsby is on, for example, and which end Daisy is on. But the fact that you can feel such intense emotions alone for each individual character, be it love or hate, that shows that Fitzgerald knows what he’s drawing out from each reader. In between those two contrasting spectrums, for me at least, lies the narrator, Nick Carraway, who is like the middle ground. Even to this day, I battle with myself on the opinion of whether I like Nick or if he annoyed me - and I’m still not sure which it has to be. He’s a useful cog, more than useful really, imperative actually, in moving along the story. He befriends (or rather Gatsby) befriends him and he is Daisy’s cousin - a neat little tie in which allows him to be partial to both parties, to reconnect the long lost relations between the two and in the end, witness the demise of what in this day and age, would have been branded as “Daisby” or “Gatsy”, pick your poison. It can be easy to get lost in the heaviness of this book, because the language and storytelling isn’t easy and straightforward - but rather you have to work to understand it almost all the way through. The good thing about reading it for a-levels in this case was, that picking it apart, finding meaning in every inane sentence, was the whole point and ultimately when you read it that deeply, you do become hooked, you pay extra close attention, to really get what the story is about. So easily people can just write it off as some semi-tragic love story, but it goes deeper than that and there’s so man layers to this story. Dreams, The American Dream more specifically, the rise and fall of it, the demise, ambition, power, idealism, status, image. Such rich topics embedded in the story and that’s what made me come back to it after a-levels and read it for pleasure - and love it. Like I mentioned before, the metaphor about the green light.. which is essentially this: 
“Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter - tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther….” 
I don’t know quite why I cling to this quote more than any other throughout the whole book - I mean it’s not like it holds some great revelation for me - but it just seems like this phrase, that warrants your attention, demands you listen to it. I think it’s the whole concept behind what that light represented to Gatsby - that light was Daisy, his past, present and future Daisy, his own hardships, how he rose from it, to where he stands today. He thinks he’s attained everything that could make him happy in the checklist of life - money, notoriety, parties, social standing - all that’s left to complete the life he believes is perfect, is the attainment of Daisy. That’s wherein lies the tragedy in part to his dream, the attainment, the procurement of Daisy as if she’s the missing item that will allow him fulfilment. The idea that he holds of her, of who he wants her to be in his life, overpowers the reality of who Daisy actually is and all that is lost between them. Yet Gatsby is blinded by the vision, this green light at the end of his dock, he sees it as the light that’s within his reach, yet so far - that has been his whole life. There, but not quite there yet. The light is an illusion, just like his dreams. *cue small violins*. All this lies against a backdrop of an era that echoes depression, riches and rags, rising dreams and broken dreams. The carnage that erupts in such a time, how you can go from one end of the spectrum to the other. It’s a tale of hope and hopelessness, a paradox that is essentially Jay Gatsby. Boy did I love Gatsby, I feel like you can’t help but love him. Such a fool he was, such a fool. For him, he lived and breathed a dream where money brought him happiness, his dreams of love were hinged on the green dollars; the more you get, the faster you get it, the quicker everything else, including love, will fall at your feet. *Plays Adele’s song - WE COULD HAVE HAD IT ALLLLLLLLL, ROLLING IN THE DEEEEEEP* You loveable fool, is the world we live in today any different, do people see love and money any differently? “He smiled understandingly - much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced - or seemed to face - the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.” Nick Caraway, the narrator, was very much in love with Gatsby, that’s what I felt LOL and this quote proves it to me. Gatsby is larger than life for Nick, and for me, even though I’m still always torn between whether I like Nick or not, it does seem like he was the only voice of reason between Daisy and Gatsby. But even then, how much can we rely on Nick as a narrator? Also. I did not like Daisy. Nope. That’s all I shall say. It goes without fail that if the book is mentioned, I have to mention the movie. Very few times do I love a movie adaption to a book almost as much as the book itself - in this case, I felt like the movie did the book justice. For me, The Great Gatsby is in part cinematic brilliance, the scenes, the acting, the camera angles, it’s a vision to behold. DiCaprio’s acting was phenomenal, I loved him even more for what he brought to Gatsby’s character so naturally. There’s a specific scene, which I watch over and over with bated breath in the movie, simply for DiCaprio’s appearance, his expression, the whole set scene and it’s this part. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka-TT... “My life has got to be like this. It has to keep going up.” Ah brilliance, such finesse. Is this review getting too long? I know you’re all too kind to stop me, so I’ll stop myself. I loved this book and the movie - don’t be put off by the hype of this story and the legend that it proclaims to be - it is amazing, but when you pick it up and discover that on your own, you’ll come to love it, really love it, in the way that I did.

16,Kirsten Tatum,"Ok, Let's talk Gatsby everyone! So, I absolutely LOVED this book. I watched the movie first (I know, I know, shame on me) and LOVED the movie. 1920s in general was just a great time and the music was incredible. So, as I was reading the book, after each chapter, I would watch the scene from the movie as well. This way, I was really able to see how well done the movie was. And let me tell you, the book to movie adaptation was spot on about 99% of the whole book. I remember reading at one point that Gatsby's chauffeur showed up at Nick's house in a uniform of robin’s-egg blue and sure enough, in the movie a man shows up at Nick's in a robin's-egg blue uniform. Crazy.That doesn't mean you should not read the book if you have watched the movie and vice versa! F. Scott Fitzgerald was a freakin genius and his writing style is so unique. He states things in such a way that makes literally EVERYTHING sound poetic and musical. The book is a quick read and absolutely worth it. I would rate it a 99.7% just because SPOILER Daisy should have ended up with Gatsby or at least gone to the funeral or something, not ended up miserable with douchey-mick-douche-pants."
17,Casey,"This is one of my all-time favorite books. Fitzgerald's writing has a flourish to it that makes reading this book almost too easy, and add really beautiful descriptions of locations, making this book extremely colorful (in the almost-literal sense).I love the story's passionate pursuit of that elusive American Dream - and the poor, sad end that awaits the far-too-illusioned Gatsby. Fitzgerald's wistful narrator Nick Carraway is also extremely biased, which makes for fun, supercilious storytelling. It is also remarkable to watch the tone of the narration change as Nick matures.The aspect of the book that I love the most is the attention it pays to illuminating what is real and what is not. Fitzgerald has an elegant way of pointing out the flaws in the glitz of the Jazz Age. In one poignantly-written scene, a guest at one of Gatsby's parties illustrates the foreignness of anything with depth:A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.“What do you think?” he demanded impetuously.“About what?” He waved his hand toward the book-shelves.“About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They’re real.”“The books?”He nodded.“Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I thought they’d be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real. Pages and—Here! Lemme show you.”I just adore that brief moment that points to the way in which this society had become entirely accustomed to, if not dependent on, the shallow glitter of parties and champagne, and forgotten the beauty of that which is real.Carraway's disillusionment, in contrast to Gatsby's unfailing belief in the impossible, is shown in a sad light, even while Gatsby is unquestionably made out to be tragically deluded.Fitzgerald created a book that is a beautiful representation of the Jazz Age, with just the right narrator to keep the moral from becoming too ""preachy."" I think this is an absolute masterpiece."
18,Elissa Preston,Just re-read this for book club. What a masterful piece of writing. The characters are so complex that I'm not sure how to feel about any of them. I am actually re-re-reading it now to make notes.
19,Tom Webster,"Beautifully written, Fitzgerald has a way with words that is intoxicating.Gatsby's tireless reinvention of himself as he strives to become something more for the sake of love makes you ache. You hope that maybe, just maybe, things will work out and deliver the sort of happy ending that only happens in Hollywood.Of course that isn't to be the case.Beneath the glitz and the glamour there is this amazing sadness, a melancholia which pervades the entire story.Poor James Gatz may have become the enigmatic Jay Gatsby with all of the distractions which only the truly wealthy can afford but all the money in the World can't really change who he is.His past is a concoction of lies and half truths, his friends are false and his happiness, his entire reason for being is predicated on the hope that a capricious, flighty young girl loves him as much after five years as he loves her.There is one particular passage at the end of the book after Carraway has his chance meeting with Tom which sums things up perfectly:“They were careless people, Tom and Daisy — they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made. . . ”I think for me this sums up completely how I view Daisy's flirtation/affair/dalliance call it what you will with Gatsby. Careless.Much like Tom and his mistresses there is no thought for anyone else who gets hurt or caught up along the way.I once heard Fitzgerald mentioned as ""Shakespeare for the modern era"". Maybe they were right, modern tragedies don't come much better"
20,Chris Johnson,"The Great Gatsby is a classic that lives up to the word classic. A purely genius representation of the time period through both the social aspects and the imagery that Fitzgerald provides. I was captivated all through the book and left with questions as well as many different opinions about certain aspects of the book. The iconic face superimposed on the cover is one that provides imagery throughout the entire book and gives a glimpse into the world that Mr. Carroway describes in his narration. During this time in American history that Fitzgerald describes, the United States was riddled with bootleggers and other forms of illegal activity. Fitzgerald describes all the lavish expenses, the beautiful architecture, the gorgeous clothing, and the extravagant parties thrown by the rich and prominent. All of which lead down a destructive path that ultimately harms a few of the main characters and leaves Mr. Carroway in a misunderstood world of anguish. Hidden agendas and hidden emotions throughout the book make this a must read for any classic lover and history lovers alike. My favorite aspect is the hidden thoughts of Carroway, the narrator. Does he secretly love Gatsby or is it just the time period speaking. An interesting thought to be sure. I rank this in my top five books of all time! I would recommend this to everyone, enjoy!"
21,Amber Strayhorn," The Great Gatsby was an extremely good book. It was well written, insightful, and shined a light on America during the 1920's. It tells a story of a man named Nick and different experiences he has during his time spent in New York. In the book we meet important characters such as, Gatsby, Daisy, and Tom. Later on we learn about Gatsby's love for Daisy which make the book that more interesting. In the beginning the book did start off very slow but with everything that was going on in the book it made you want to continue reading. I also liked the way Fitzgerald used color imagery to tell the story. The colors were a huge part of the book.  I can now see why people call The Great Gatsby the best American novel. I was excited to read the book because of the way everyone spoke about it and it definitely fulfilled my expectations. I would recommend this book to other high school students. You may have to reread some things in order to understand what is going on. The ending to the book is also very good and stood out to me. I would read this book again in the future, I really enjoyed it. "
22,Kressel Housman,"Review #1: I read this back in high school, and I should probably re-read it for better appreciation, but I remember liking it at the time, if only because my essay on the test about it got me an A. I even remember what I wrote. The Great Gatsby is about the death of the American Dream. Jay Gatsby represents the American Dream, and he is undone by violence (Tom), dishonesty (Jordan), and materialism (Daisy). But what struck me years later was Jay Gatsby's real name: Jacob Gatz. Was he supposed to be Jewish? If so, then this is a book about assimilation and how it is ultimately a self-destructive path. Like I said, I really ought to re-read it now that I'm an adult.Review #2: Okay, I've re-read it, and to all of you who said my English teacher's interpretation didn't give me the right understanding of the book, I see your point. I'd forgotten so much, I'm now of the opinion that I only skimmed the book the first time around, picking up on those points I'd need in my essay. Also, it wasn't Jacob Gatz, but James Gatz, so there goes my Jewish assimilation theory. But Tom is violent, Daisy is materialistic, and Jordan is dishonest. Gatsby is all about aspiration. So my teacher wasn't totally wrong.My appreciation of the book this time around was definitely enhanced by my knowledge of the Prohibition era, which I got mainly from 
Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition
 by Daniel Okrent and ""Prohibition,"" the PBS documentary made from it. If I were going to teach it to high school students, I'd have them watch that documentary first. A comparison of the two film adaptations would be interesting also. All in all, I can see why The Great Gatsby is such a classic. The characters are vibrant and unforgettable, and the ending isn't just tragic, but ironic in its complexity. I'll never love it the way I love Pride and Prejudice, but I can't see giving it less than a 5. "
23,Jvoytcheff,"Yikes! I see some of the reviews up here that absoulutely bashed the book, and I wonder what is was about the book that everyone disliked. Then I notice that a good majority of these people were forced to read it in high school. Read it again! This book should NEVER be taught in a high school; there are too many marvelous details and little delights for the typical student to have any interest in (arguably). My favourite part of it all was the style, the image Fitzgerald played through his words. Details, details, just like a movie. Loved how he presented Gatsby, how he created this extraordinary man who's reputation slowly dimishes as we near the end of the book. He took us from the glitz and glamour, from which we cannot look away, to the raw and undeniable reality of ourselves as humans. Beyond the obvious, the materialism, Fitzgerald poses a question that may disturb the peace: how tangible are our aspirations? Life is to be tackled with zeal, vigour, and that plain old-school hope. And yet this is the life of a dreamer, a life that may not be attainable in reality. So in Gatsby's last, tragic seconds of his life, you wonder what he would conclude in reflection. Was he truely happy in his oblivion, or were his dreams just empty yearnings for the impossible? This book is highly autobiographical; Fitzgerald was married to a woman with an attitude not too different than Daisy's. After the success of his first book, they became celebrities. Evidently, they struggled in the spotlight. This book was an insight on just the beginning of their eve crumbling marriage, and ultimately, the life they share.The ending hit me incredibly hard, and left me with a void in my life. Incredibly drawn out, this book essentially made me think of things I couldn't wrap my head around. Though it was ever. So. Simple. "
24,StarszBooks,"When I read this book in high school, I loathed it. I believe I felt that way because I lacked the literary capacity to truly absorb the essence of the text. I am happy that I gave it another go. The story is so sad and so true. America in the 1920's, unfortunately, is no different than America right now (as far as social economic statuses go...)and that saddens me. And Gatsby...poor poor Gatsby."
25,Henry,"It seems that Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby to express his own conflicted feelings about the era of American history that he (and the characters he based on himself) experienced. Like James Gatsby in the story, Francis became incredibly wealthy at a young age in order to chase a the lady of his dreams (Daisy for Gatsby and Zelda for Fitzgerald). However, F. Scott found out that the world of the rich has an interior of hypocrisy and immorality, hidden by a mask of glitz and glamor that he had idolized. This part of him is represented by Nick Carraway, a thoughtful young man from the midwest. This idea of conflicting parts of the upper class is probably the theme of this book. Fitzgerald witnessed them firsthand, so he decided to write a book expressing these ideas via characters. The book was written in a narrative style, with Nick describing the events of the story and narrating monologues. This is surprisingly effective, despite Nick being a secondary character. All in all, I enjoyed this book. Nick's narrative and insights were enjoyable and the characters were memorable. The story itself is both a very well written description of the depression and prohibition eras as well as the modern materialism that so strongly grips America. "
26,Radwa,"ريفيو فيديو للرواية والفيلم: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKPH0...This book exceeded my expectations.It started out okay, and almost halfway through, I was set on giving it only 3 stars rating, since it was okay. But the last three chapters turned everything around, and it was a whirlwind of emotions. and I don't regret giving it 5 stars.It's my first Fitzgerald, and I loved how poetic his writings was, I felt like I wanted to take some paragraphs out of the book and just stare at them everyday, that's how beautiful some of descriptions of life and human emotions were.Of course, his characters are flawed, they're racist and adultery is a recurring theme in this book. But these flaws made them more real. The way he described Gatsby's house and parties, made it so easy for me to imagine the lavish life he had. The book is set in New York, and I'm glad that I'm coming across more New York-based novels these days, but Fitzgerald's New York is lonely and shallow, though full of life. The book is basically Carraway retelling his story of knowing Jay Gatsby and how he became a big part of his life. A bit by bit, we know more and more of Gatsby and by the end, we're not really sure if we did know him for real or it was all an illusion.I haven't seen any movie adaptations yet, but I'm planning to do very soon.Highly recommend this book! "
27,Piyush,"The best novels of a time reveal some unarticulated feeling of a particular generation, culture or society. They capture the 'consciousness' of an age, so to speak. They feel like they are sprinkled with gold dust. But the great novels, those which survive the test of time, contain something else, not gold dust, but ambrosia, manna, some immaterial treasure. They capture 'the holy grail of literature' - some common strand of humanity, something that holds across generations, time, cultures and civilizations. The paradox of being a great novel is that they are not often as fiercely cherished by readers as others are. Your most personally cherished novels are those which feel like they were written specifically for you. Since they apply to everyone, the greatness of the great novels lends them an impersonal character. Or so I used to believe, until I read The Great Gatsby.The Great Gatsby is a great novel, with the superficial appearance of a period drama, which I will always fiercely, passionately cherish. "
28,Melissa Rudder,"The more I read The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the more I am convinced that it is, quite simply, an excellent piece of literature. Fitzgerald's writing is poetic and compact; the elements of his relatively short novel thread together so exquisitely that each sentence, each scene, each moment, plays a vital role in the development of character, plot, and theme. It's truly fantastic. I read some novels for their intriguing characters. I read some novels for their exciting plots. I read some novels for their compelling style or structure. I rarely read novels for their setting. Maybe 1984, Harry Potter, or The Giver. But anyway, some people do. And The Great Gatsby, in one novel, has it all: interesting characters, a plot where the tension mounts until ""the shit hits the fan"" (a description I used in my second period, much to my later regret), poetic prose and breath-taking or heart-wrenching symbolism, and settings that come alive in their decadence or desperation.I teach The Great Gatsby unoriginally but appropriately as a novel about the American dream. And it's quite fun to watch how all parts of the novel seem to comment on the American dream. It's even more fun to watch how my students can see it happening. The characters are complex and realistic, but are still able to allegorically stand for, or at least represent, entire social classes. Which is amazing. Fitzgerald has effectively created an allegory of social classes, yet instead of filling it with flat, predictable characters like ""Prudence"" and ""Strength,"" he fills it with real people. Gatsby is an interesting character. At once mysterious, incredible, and vulnerable, he's a character that the reader, like Nick, can easily empathize with but less easily accept. Daisy is so weak that at times I hate her. But I think she hates herself too, which gives my righteous feminist wrath a bitter taste. Nick, the eyes through which we see the tale, is interesting himself. He's always on the sidelines, but always complacent in the events of the novel, though he criticizes them later (in spite of his claim to never judge). Myrtle, Tom, George... They really are all fantastically drawn.The symbolism is genius: eyes, green lights, cars. All well executed. There is a biting humor throughout the narration--I love the party scenes, where women greet each other with screams of joy (even though they don't know each other's names) and where men are introduced as ""Mr. Mumble""--that is quite enjoyable. And the last few paragraphs are... simply amazing. (I was about to quote them, but realized it might be too spoilery. But seriously, amazing.)"
29,Michael Kane,"I think what set this book apart was just how enjoyable it was to read. The beautiful prose, stunning imagery, and flawlessly developed characters all make for an exciting story, but these aesthetic elements belie just how POWERFUL the message is. Rarely after reading a classic do I want to reread it immediately, but I'm seriously considering it. I'm still reeling from Gatsby's disillusionment, and my own subsequent questioning of my values and goals. For a novel that is so beautiful to behold, it sure doesn't leave you feeling happy and hopeful by the end. Swear to God, reading the last paragraph almost made me cry.(view spoiler)[Fave Character: I have to say Gatsby, because his naive optimism, and misplaced values just broke my heart. Despite the fact that he represents so many negative qualities like shallow ambition and wasteful shows of money, He is likable with his awkward social mannerisms and desperate love for Daisy. His intentions were so pure, and he was pursuing something that he really genuinely thought he wanted, he just couldn't self-analyze to understand why he wanted them. Had he been able to see beyond the glittering and shiny facade of the money and the elegance that Daisy represented, he would've seen her for what she was; a bored, vapid, girl with a lot of money and social grace. There was nothing inherently lovable about Daisy. In fact, other than her beauty, the only thing we hear Nick compliment her on is her voice and manner of speaking, which we later understand comes from her upbringing in the upper class, and was only acquired as a result of being surrounded by Old Money her entire life. Gatsby places this value on her, as she enchants him with her radiating aura of wealth, ease of life, and casual carelessness. It is these pillars, not Daisy herself, that Gatsby falls in love with. She represents everything he could never have as a result of his lowborn past, and so, slapping the label of ""love"" on her, he throws himself full force into achieving the things that would create circumstances where she could love him too. Unfortunately, Gatsby underestimates just how superficial his goal is, because when he gets there, when he finally is within reach of his dream of being with Daisy, he is faced with the reality that Daisy's love was completely conditional. Her love for him was contingent on Gatsby having money, and being a part of the same social strata as her. When she learned that his money came from bootlegging, she retreated waaaaaay the hell away from Gatsby back into the socially accepted arms of Tom. What Gatsby and Daisy had was never love, but rather his obsession with what Daisy represented, and how she would be the perfect cherry on top of his American Dream life, and her boredom with her own life and desire to get back at Tom. THIS is the illusion of the American Dream, that you can believe in something so much, only to realize that it is just a shadow of a wisp...completely insubstantial. Gatsby's disillusionment had a huge impact on how I view my own dreams, and so for that reason (and also because he's adorable) he made my fave character of this book.Important Themes:The American Dream. Symbolized by the green light across the lake, the critique of this idea is the predominant message in the book. Using Gatsby as a poster boy, Fitzgerald throws into a harsh light the idea that anyone can make anything of themselves. Gatsby, born into a family of nothing, resolves himself to become wealthy and successful to earn Daisy's love, even dabbling in illicit activities to make it happen (highlighting the moral depravity that comes with money.) Even after he sheds his old name and life, he finds himself unable to completely escape into the dream world of the East Egg. He doesn't know how to talk or act as naturally and carelessly as they do, he doesn't feel comfortable around them, he simply doesn't fit in. Despite everything he has done to escape his past, it is still a part of who he is.""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.""One of the interpretations of this quote is that your past will always be a defining part of what makes you you, and no matter how you try and escape it as you reach forward toward your dreams, you cannot change what it is, and how it has impacted you.Money. Tying into the theme of the American Dream, Fitzgerald calls into question whether or not wealth is actually a dream worth striving for. Money doesn't solve all your problems, and it even brings on a slew of entirely different ones. Despite the glitzy outer appearance of the characters with money, they are plagued by the exact same problems that burden the poor. The parallel between George and Tom losing control of their wives is a good example of this. Furthermore, because they have SO much money, it seems like they legitimately stop caring about things other than themselves, their status/reputation, and their money. So you have these characters, like Tom, Daisy, and Jordan, who are wealthy beyond measure, and as people they're reduced to these snotty, arrogant, bored and apathetic shells that just flit around the world trying to find reasons to keep existing. No one actually cares about each other. This is especially obvious when Gatsby's funeral is almost completely unattended except for Henry Gatz and Owl Eyes. The money in this novel is represented as the cause for the superficiality that affects all the rich and even the poor (like Myrtle), and also the dark seed of corruption that influences people toward evil (as symbolized by Meyer Wolfshiem).Time. Time is definitely a huge symbol in The Great Gatsby, but I can't decide what exactly what it represents. I think the way I'm choosing to interpret it is that holding onto the past, or what was, is just as futile as trying to run from it. Time is fickle. It can pass by slowly and then quickly, and be stuck in one place and then gone forever. Gatsby lived his entire life almost entirely in the past and future, as opposed to the present. Despite trying to run from his past as a poor man, he desperately clung to the weeks he spent with Daisy five years ago when they fell in ""love,"" while always reaching toward his perfect future that he envisioned. He built his entire life around the feelings that those memories evoked in him, and the promise of the future, and it literally helped cause his death when it all crashed down around him as he realized that his memories and hopes were no longer relevant....he lost track of what was actually happening around him, and couldn't see that what he relied on to ground himself was less solid than a gust of wind. I think that's an important message too for the story, was just to be in the now, live in the present. Understand where you came from, and acknowledge that it is part of who you are, but don't pine for lost days of summer, or for the first blossoms of spring; rather, make of life what you can here and now, as this is the only time we can ever actually make a difference in.

30,Erin Nudi,"Edit: Just read this book for the second time in preparation of the movie. It never gets old!I didn't like this book when I first read it in high school. But after reading it a few more times I really came to appreciate it and now it's one of my top two favorite books, being beaten out only by My Sweet Audrina by V.C. Andrews. I think what makes this book difficult to get into is the fact that all of the characters are...really obnoxious! Haha, it's hard to sympathize with anyone, except for the narrator, Nick...although even though he is the narrator he really isn't the protagonist, Gatsby is. I've only read a few books like this and I enjoy it because it's different - having the person telling the story from first person point of view, but the book is really about another character. I also really enjoy the juxtaposition in this book from new money and old money, and many other comparisons. The tragedy of the story is that Gatsby is so in love with Daisy, Nick's second cousin, but she will ultimately never love him back. Is it heroic and admirable that Gatsby's love never wavers, despite the obvious fact he's being treated like crap, or should he just move on? It's debatable and I'm not sure what the answer is."
31,Matt Huff,The best.
32,Paul,"The Great Gatsby. Where to begin. After being forced to buy this book by my mom, I sincerely thought this would be one of the worst books I would read. I have always hated books that my mom read when she was younger, and thought this would be the same as the rest. But this book is not just about the story. Oh no, this book has much more depth then that. Gatsby, a rich man who has parties regularly and has all the money in the world, is actually more lonely than you think. He lives his life as a desolate man, always wishing for the one true love, which in this case, is Daisy. Nick, Daisy's cousin, live next door to Gatsby, and Gatsby sees moment he was waiting for..This sound like a romance, and a bad one at that, but the true meaning of the book is not that, but the American Dream. The American Dream is the dream all people who come and are from America have. To live a better life than their parents and ancestors. Everyones American Dream is different, but Gatsby's is unique. To others, it seems as if he has the wealth and power, the things most people see as their American Dream. All Gatsby wants is true love, something he is not quite able to reach, even with all his power. Besides the American Dream theme, another figurative theme of the book is The Great Depression and the roaring 20s. It fits perfectly to the theme of the book, how in the beginning everything was getting better and better for Gatsby, and he had almost reached the highest pinnacle, achieving the American Dream. Then everything crashed down, which was when Daisy chose Tom, and Gatsby was murdered. This book was made in the 1920s and was probably how Scott Fitzgerald got the idea of the novel. I give all my books high reviews, but this one really was great. I recommend to the people who like to find out the figurative language books offer. The Great Gatsby is not on my top 10 book list, but this is because I don't like the genre of this type of book, no action and just talking in it. I still enjoyed it, because the themes were amazingly written.The Genre is Contemporary "
33,Carolyn Richardson,Love this book! I have read it at least three or four times.
34,Sandy,"Taking a look at the books that I have been reading lately, the conclusion that comes out them is that there is a turn towards modern classic books, and not contemporary ones. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald came to my attention, after I had seen a list at the beginning of 2012 of the new movies that will be based on books. The Great Gatsby was one of them, so it immediately got on my to-read list.We are in the summer of 1992 in New York, and out narrator is Nick Carraway, a graduate from Yale and a veteran of WWI, who gets a job in New York and rents a small house in Long Island, next door to the ostentatious mansion of Jay Gatsby, a mysterious millionaire. ""Day and night Jay Gatsby's mansion on West Egg buzzes with bright young things drinking, dancing and debating his mysterious character. For Gatsby- young, handsome, fabulously rich- always seems alone in the crowd, watching and waiting, although no one knows what for. Beneath the shimmering surface of his life he is hiding a secret longing that can never be fulfilled."" (book cover)That would be all I want to share with you about the plot because I believe that this is what is fascinating about this book. The mystery behind Jay Gatsby. While reading, you have all these questions popping into your head and as you read, you get eager to discover the links between the characters of the books, and what their actions will be. Fitzgerald's writing is great and the way he develops the story simply amazing. It is no wonder that this book is considered one of the best of the modern classics category. I am glad I have included this book on my have-read list.Even though a relatively small novel with only 172 pages, this book by Fitzgerald has been widely analysed. Once you have read the novel, and you want to find out more about it, you will discover an endless source of articles on the internet and on books, as you can see HERE. In fact, the Penguin edition, the one I have, even has its own introduction and notes by Tony Tanner which I found rather 'blabby' but certainly informative.I am definitely looking forward to watching the movie.http://alookinsidemyjournal.blogspot...."
35,Joann,"Ein Meisterwerk über die Sehnsucht nach einer uneinholbaren Vergangenheit, welches einen unvergesslichen Einblick in die Ära der 20er Jahre ermöglicht! Das Lesen gleicht einer rasanten Eisenbahnfahrt und lässt einen am Ende beinahe atemlos und mit einer gewissen Wehmut zurück. 5 Sterne! "
36,Kris Lugosi,"A homage to a wonderful time of lavish parties and well dressed folk. The Great Gatsby is a classic. I read it a long time ago and it is overdo for me to read it again. Give me the 20's any day mister, I missed my decade :)"
37,Catherine Sharpe,"I love this book - it has to be one of my all time favourites. Such an honest representation of humanity, it shocks me everytime I think of it. I want to write books this good, and I know that's a leap because F. Scott Fitzgerald was somewhat of a literary genius, but I'd like to try. His descriptions are so captivating that you become part of the story and you're as connected to the characters as they are to each other. A truly beautiful and honest story."
38,Matthew,"The Great Gatsby Book ReviewThe Great Gatsby is a novel about how love and money can influence a man and how it can change his life. Jay Gatsby is a man that spends his life chasing only two things, money and a woman named Daisy. His love for this woman drove him to the extreme lengths of committing crimes to make himself rich, to impress her. He bootlegs alcohol, and engages in numerous other illegal activities to become wealthy. He throws parties every Friday night in the hopes that Daisy will come. Daisy and Gatsby finally become a “thing” and her husband finds out. Her husband murders Gatsby and then kills himself. In the end it shows that the American dream has disintegrated into the mere pursuit of wealth by any means necessary, moral values aside.I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and the characters in this book, as I too have come in between relationships a time or two before. I felt as though I could relate to Gatsby in that sense and could tell that in everything he did, he didn’t do it to be reckless, but in the name of love. I think that’s extremely respectable.This story’s plot developed very slowly and I had troubles keeping on reading. It wasn’t a story that I had to force myself put down; I’d even go as far as to say I had to force myself to pick it up and continue to read. Really ended with a bang though."
39,Samantha Sun,"I think this book was a great entertaining novel to read. I think Fitzgerald did a great job on accentuating probable stories after World War II. I like he added Daisy as the ideal girl of all the men but falls in love with a man who goes away to war. Its a classic love story because they ended up reuniting with a twist. I find this book intriguing the most when the author included the infidelity between Tom and Daisy with Mytrle and Jay. As I read the book I found it proundly interesting how Nick seemed to be the epitomy of a ""perfect"" person. He never really followed the people around but rather he did his own thing and tried to help his friends as much as he could. It was very touching how Daisy and Jay reunited because I could tell it was very emotional for Daisy since she kept crying. The ending of the book was okay, but the death of Jay was very sad and pitiful. He was my favorite character because he achieved his American dream for scratch and served a prominate mate for any girl."
40,Blaise Morita,"In 1925 writer F. Scott Fitzgerald put pen to paper and authored the definitive fictional story that embodied the swinging good times of 1920's New York. The Great Gatsby speeds through the fast-paced lives of several upper crust figureheads, the pinnacle of which is Jay Gatsby, a man of unlimited wealth and even grander aspirations of love. His love of grand parties become spectacles that enter into lore, and his taste for life spills over into dangerous territory when he begins courting a married woman.Viewed through the inquisitive eyes of narrator Nick Carraway, himself mainly a bystander in the whole affair, Gatsby's actions take center stage as his efforts devolve into a struggle to recapture past glory that is inevitably slipping past his grasp. The Great Gatsby brilliantly encapsulates a period of time in American society: the descent of the Roaring 20's into the Great Depression. A reality check for both American society and Gatsby himself, this classic tale of futility and dedication to excess resonates still throughout the annuals of literary giants."
41,J.T. Wilson,"A man with nothing finds himself in love with a woman out of his league, so spends years dragging himself up to her level by hook or by crook: he was played by DiCaprio in the latest film, but I wonder if this isn't the role Kanye West hasn't been playing for his whole life. Certainly the conspicuous consumption, the gaudy ostentatiousness and the self-pitying solipsism could all be compared to the latter-day gangsta rapper.We don't know Gatsby's story though, at least not at first; we're several chapters and many awful parties in before the eponymous character invites our narrator into his house and, later, his life. Even before that, we've glimpsed the aching loneliness and hysterical superficiality in the party scene of the 20s, the whispered excitement and quiet desperation. It's illuminated, of course, by Fitzgerald's light, poetic prose, unlocking the tragic melancholia behind even an oaf like cuckolded/adulterer husband Tom. Our narrator is a stranger in this land, but isn't everyone we meet? We're at Gatsby's house, but whose home?I've mentioned the gangster rap scene. I'm reminded, too, of the New York party scene of the 1980s, depicted in James St James' 'Disco Bloodbath'. Both have at their hearts a character who came from elsewhere, who became the king of the scene by sheer force of will and hosted parties mostly notable for their frothy all-surface-no-feeling nature. Both end with a murder, and the party scene, not blessed with empathy, moves on. The difference, of course, is that Gatsby takes the bullets while Alig holds the gun (or hammer). "
42,Kat Wong,"Maybe this gets extra points for nostalgia, but I will always love this story. It's a timeless tale of themes that are forever repeating themselves (status, dreams vs reality, love, greed). Every part of the story contains something people of any generation can relate to. The writing is as good as I remember in its simple yet understated style. The characters are as horrible and wonderful, too. I think this might be one of those books to re-read every few years, though I worry the style is going to bore each new generation. I hope people will always read this story. It can teach a reader much and gets better with age."
43,David Tickner," ""The Great Gatsby"" takes place during the Roaring Twenties in the United States. The Roaring Twenties were a time of great Prosperity in the United States. The main character is Nick Wooster, a WW I veteran who is currently selling bonds. One main topic I found interesting was the sociology of the upper class. The theme most closely related to this is the shallowness of the upper class. In the novel, the new rich and powerful are young and immature. Fitzgerald shows that during this time the upper class vulgar, gaudy, ostentatious, and lacking in social graces. For example, Gatsby lives in a monstrously huge mansion, wears colorful suits, drives a Rolls-Royce and many, many other cars, and does not pick up on subtle social signals, such as the insincerity of the Sloanes’ invitation to lunch. This contrasts with the old wealth, which is represented by grace, taste, subtlety, and elegance. For example, the Buchanans’ tasteful home and the simplicity of the Buchanans' and Jordan. However, Fitzgerald contrasts this comparison with morality. He shows that the old wealth use their money to bully others and to justify their wrong-doings. This is represented by Mr. Buchanan and his affair with Myrtle, or when the Buchanan's move away after Gatsby is murdered. However, Gatsby who has recently gained his wealth has a kind and loyal heart. This novel is and always will be one of my favorite novels of all time."
44,Valerie,This over the top love story will always remain a classic as it explores the burden of the wealthy and the consequences of lingering to long. This story based in the roaring 20`s is ridiculously relatable as each characters holds a new complex story in which allow the reader to form their own opinion on them. This tale makes the reader question the actions of each characters as Fitzgerald writes dramatic flaws in each one leaving the reader to choose the one which thy believe has committed the lesser of the evils. This fantastic story explores the hidden life of the roaring 20`s with prohibition and all the hidden power as a classic for many years to come.
45,Bhaskar Bhagyawardhan,"So 29,000 people on goodreads didn't like the great gatsby and bestowed one-star ratings upon it. This obviously angers me but I shall totally abstain from getting sentimental and debating melodramatically o'er ""how can someone hate this book"". Because I know most of them didn't read it by choice. They teach it over there in american high schools. These people read it at a point in their lives when they couldn't have connected at all with ""what the hell"" was going on in the book. Gatsby entered their lives at the wrong time. He was thrust upon them.When I finished reading it at 4:30 last morning, I realized, like generations of readers already have, why the great gatsby is regarded as one of the greatest books of all time.How I wish I had the privilege of reading this in my school days and writing papers on it.(Our school made us read pride and prejudice instead here in india.)So coming to the point, why did they decide that this book should be a part of the curriculum in the high schools of america? because the great gatsby is an invaluable account of the mindset of the rich and the glamorous of new york city in those times. And today the situation has only intensified. not just in new york city, but in almost every city where materialism answers to the desires of men. many wealthy people wear the cloak of sophistication to conceal their shallow thoughts. fitzgerald depicted this with exceptional literary finesse in the great gatsby. That is why it is a classic. not just an american classic, but a universal classic. Most people read for pleasure. Chances are that majority of them will dislike gatsby. But for almost every reader who regards books as a source of understanding life, gatsby will stay in his ""good books"" forever."
46,Chad Sayban,"""He smiled understandingly-much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to face--the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself.""The Great Gatsby has long been labeled as “the great American novel.” It is required reading in nearly every high school and college English program and many consider it one of the greatest novels ever written. So I was very interested to see what my reaction to the book would be at this point in my life rather than what I remembered of it from when I was a teenager. Set in the 1920s Jazz Age mecca of Long Island, New York, The Great Gatsby is the story of one man’s single-minded quest as told by an outsider, Nick Carraway. Jay Gatsby is at once the embodiment of one of the most narcissistic eras of Americana, the roaring twenties. Fitzgerald seems to stuff every foible into this one character – romanticism, excess, lies, infidelity, greed, lust, envy. By the end of the story, Gatsby ceases to be an individual and instead becomes the personification of an entire era and mindset. Fitzgerald’s writing is a thing of beauty and holds what becomes an unlikable story together. His sharp, sparse prose elicits an era when few people of means were concerned about anything or anyone beyond themselves. The characters are brought to life in crisp, clear detail. However, none of them are in any way sympathetic. Jay Gatsby is an obsessive charlatan. Daisy Buchanan is shallow. Jordan Baker is shady. George Wilson is crazy. Tom Buchanan is a racist who hates Gatsby for his advances on his wife while he is cheating on her with Wilson’s wife. Ultimately, there is nobody in the story who is at all appealing. Even the first-person narrator, Nick Carraway, is unlikeable – assuming the role of critic of everyone while he takes no responsibility for anything.So why is The Great Gatsby such a classic novel? There are two reasons – Fitzgerald’s writing and his message. First, he captures a time and place with precise writing utilizing not one more word than is needed. Few writers have ever been able to pack so much into so few pages. Second, Fitzgerald forces the reader to examine themselves and society in the light of these characters. Before you can criticize them and their time, you must first analyze yourself. The Great Gatsby isn’t about entertainment. It is about voyeuristic social commentary. We feel compelled to continue reading, not because the story is fun or exciting, but because we need to know how it all ends. We know that it is all going to end badly, but we continue on because we want to see it all end badly, just like the characters surrounding the car wreck. We look because we can’t help ourselves. Ultimately that is the point of The Great Gatsby…none of us as righteous as we sometimes think we are. The Great Gatsby may not be the most pleasurable of stories, but that misses the point. The reader may not like the story…they probably shouldn’t like the story. It is a flawed story in so many ways. But there is no denying the power of the story. There is no denying the way Fitzgerald brings home the story. It is The Great Gatsby’s timeless ability to cleave the pomposity of an era in two within so few pages that makes it a classic."
47,Madyson,"I finished this book a few hours ago and wanted to do a review on it right away but had to hold off because I couldn't find the right words to describe how much I loved this marvelous, marvelous book.The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is about a man named Nick Carraway who moves East for work, into a house next door to a mysterious man named Jay Gatsby who throws lavish parties but no one really knows anything about but ends up becoming friends with him and finding out he is in love with a woman named Daisy Buchanan - who just so happens to be Nick’s cousin. However, Daisy is already married, to a man named Tom who is having an affair with a woman named Myrtle Wilson who is also already married, to a man named George. IT’S MADNESS I TELL YOU. And I loved every second of it! I think the thing that got me most, that really pulled me in, was the fabulous writing. How the sentences flowed into one another with such ease, and the words he used to describe the simplest things making them complex. That Fitzgerald had a way with words ~“He smiled understandingly - much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in a life. It faced - or seemed to face - the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.”There is no way for me to put it other than I love this fucking book."
48,Josh Garfi,"I read this book several months ago, and have re-read many sections since then. It was the first F.Scott novel that I read, and it remains my favourite.When I try to explain to people what this novel is about, and why I love it so much I often have trouble articulating quite how I feel. Normally I just end up telling them this: it is a book about dreams, and their pursuit, and how they shape the human experience. As DFW said, 'Fiction’s about what it is to be a fucking human being', and I do not think that there is any book that demonstrates this better than Gatsby does.In order to understand this masterpiece one really has to read it. I cannot summarise in a way that does it justice, just as one cannot summarise a great musical work - it is only by consuming art that one can come to understand its beauty. However I will say what this book has meant and still means to me. That is one of the most amazing things about this novel: ever since reading it I have been relating my life back to the text and to the themes and to the events of the novel.As I said, it is a book about dreams - how they define us, how we see them and ultimately how their pursuit changes us - and it is dreams that seem to me to be at the heart of the human experience: whether they are dreams of the perfect romance with a girl who seems to embody perfection; or dreams of wealth and sucess and fame; or dreams of the precious, innocent past when everything was easier and of the golden future when the problems of the present will be solved and it will be just like old times.When I sit down to write my diary and I think about myself and my own life, these are the things I think about. I, just like most people, am defined by my dreams: when I hope it is in hope of reaching them, when I despair it is at my failure to achieve them. Gatsby's dream is of a girl, Daisy, but, to me at least, it embodies all dreams - to such an extent that I have used the names from the novel as code names in my diary. I see myself and others in the character of Gatsby - his dreams and willingness to reinvent himself to reach them - and I see the way I view others in the way Gatsby sees Daisy and Tom and that green light across the bay.Maybe I am reading too much into it. Perhaps it is just a book about rich people and their insignificant problems. But as John Green says, 'books belong to their readers', and thus my reading is valid, and the meaning I draw from the book is real - even if I am reading too far into it, it matters to me.So it is a book about these big, important themes - but where it shines is in F.Scott's ability to address them in a subtle and non-pretentious way, while still creating charters who are relevant and using language that is exceedingly beautiful. He does not give us answers, but rather does what all good authors do: he gets his readers to think. The concluding passage is possibly the most beautiful thing ever written - not just because of its beautiful use of language, but also because of the way he manages to discuss without preaching. I won't give too much away, but the acceptance of the inevitable combines with the juxtaposition of destruction and beauty to leave the reader thinking - really thinking - and that is pretty awesome. "
49,eilasoles,"And The Great Gatsby is really about the aesthetics of class.“It was sharply different from the West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.”Who's able to write like that anymore? They've all been trying and failing desperately since. The way Fitzgerald characterizes Nick Carraway – defining and limiting his narrator so easily in just the first few pages: he is a “bond man,” the not-too-bright scion of a wealthy man, the not-too-bright bit probably being the reason he gets along so easily in his world, and with the others of his class. He isn't too probing, nor is he ambitious, and he possess certain sweet little beliefs about 'basic decencies.' He is sent to New Haven and then East, his father agreeing to finance him for a year. This is the first and last time his career is mentioned, and that about says it all: it doesn't matter very much – he'll succeed (you can't help but not, with social capital and connections), and it doesn't matter which business he goes into – it doesn't matter if he's a 'bond man' or a purveyor of yachts, all that matters is he belongs to that particular stratum of American society.What holds that class together? Wealth obviously, and a certain aesthetic that Fitzgerald captures so well in the book. But the book is also about answering the question - who is allowed entry into this class? Nick is, but Jay Gatsby is not. Wealth or ownership of property isn't the reason why, obviously. The class forms a network, almost familial, or tribal, and is reinforced by education and by marriage. In Nick's case, the connection is clear - he's Daisy's second cousin, moreover, he's gone to New Haven/Yale with Daisy's husband. The women are decorative but they also perform the important function of connecting families, in that they are objects of exchange, trafficked, in an almost exact parallel with Levi-Strauss's description of kinship ties in 'primitive' cultures. They knit this class together, and in a very real sense, they are it's culture. Gatsby wanting Daisy isn't about pure, uncorrupted love. As he (or rather Fitzgerald) so precisely pinpoints:""Her voice is full of money... That was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money - that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbal's song of it..."""
50,Amy Acheson,"want to read again, before the movie comes out"
51,Katie Campbell,"I really enjoyed this book; I liked the several love triangles that this story had. Nick Carraway, the young Yale graduate, is the narrator of the story and his perceptions shaped the story. I liked his character because although he seemed a part of these rich people’s lives, he was also the most sane and down-to-earth so to speak. He was the one that everyone went to with their secrets of affairs. It makes me sad how Gatsby took the blame for Daisy when they hit Myrtle’s car and she was accidently killed. I don’t like how George (Myrtle’s husband) shoots Gatsby either. Although this is the story of a few love triangles in a wealthy area of Long Island, the story has a much deeper meaning. The story really portrays the decline of the American dream in the 1920s (when the story took place). I feel that the author did a great job of portraying this; it all seems as if it was a metaphor for this deeper meaning. F. Scott Fitzgerald really tried to portray the emphasis that society placed in prosperity and material excess. One example of this is how Gatsby admits to Nick that he throws these lavish parties every Saturday in attempt to impress his long lost love Dasiy in hopes that she would notice him. From a writer’s perspective, I feel that I learned how to tie my major theme into my story."
52,Sara Gould,"Genial, maravilloso, esplendoroso. El típico ""por qué no he leído yo esto antes cobra vida aquí y ahora en este libro"". Qué increíble, en serio."
53,Katie Langan,"One of the most heartbreaking and frustrating books I have ever read.Fitzgerald shows us a glimpse into the world he tried so hard to join only to reveal it was full of greed, selfishness and ugliness.Gatsby builds his entire life and world around the hope of being with Daisy, who in return starts seeing him and planning their runaway life together, only to get frightened by her brute of a husband into chickening out, mowing down his husbands mistress Myrtle in Gatsby's car, letting Gatsby take the wrap and get shot by Myrtle's husband, then to just add the cherry on top, doesn't even bother going to his funeral or showing she is bothered in any tiny way.This book shows the greed and selfishness and awfulness that is present within people and the devastating effect that shallow, foolish and uncaring people can have on one good man. I think this quote perfectly sums up the ideas in this book, which will, as it did to me, break your heart and make you think twice about whether what is important in life.“They were careless people, Tom and Daisy- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.” "
54,Tahni,"All I can think to say is that this is a classic for a reason. The prose is beautiful, really bordering on verse, and it serves to both distance and tantalize the reader's emotions. Masterfully done."
55,Stephanie,"I'm kind of disappointed in my fifteen-year-old self for not having been able to recognize how exquisitely written this book is. Fitzgerald was an artist; he set out to write something beautiful and he absolutely did. I don't remember appreciating the tragic love story or the poetic writing, and i was so into those things at the time that i think i must've actually skimmed the book the first time through. That's the only explanation for how little of an impression it made on me when i first encountered it over a decade ago.I saw the movie with my mother and we both loved it. Now that i've re-read the book i realize that the film could've used a little more soot; it was so vivid and lively and quick, even at the moments that should've been darker; slower. The ending of the book comes into sharp focus; things become suddenly less whispy and more raw. I think perhaps someone slightly more jaded than Toby Maguire ought to have played Nick Callaway in order to give the film that missing depth of feeling, but that is my only criticism. There's absolutely no way to convey how achingly pretty each turn of phrase of the story is on film, but i think Baz Luhrman did as good a job as anybody ever will.I don't think that The Great Gatsby is The Greatest Story Ever, but it's certainly a good one, and it's told in the greatest way. It's a completely American story, which makes me feel both proud and ashamed, but mostly glad that my country has a story that sounds so very profound. Long live the green light; i think each generation reaches for it with even more desperation than the last."
56,Azra Blekić Aydoğan,"Again something that I read as a very young girl, unable to grasp the subtle shades of meanings in every sentence of the book. So I decided to reread it again, partially because of the Leonardo Dicaprio and the movie which is also a masterpiece in itself. It is the story of glittering forms without essence and the shining ones with it, the story of collision of two worlds that doesn't end well. Of true love and fancy."
57,Nathanial,Seriously great language here.
58,Sam Bruskin,"just re-read this, twice. and i find the last lines quoted everywhere now, with no need for attribution:So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."
59,Becher,"Honestly the novel was one of my favorite books I’ve read so far. The way the author expresses America in the 1920’s was so smart and real. The scenarios that happened in the novel happen everyone without us even knowing. Its shows how the rich look down on the poor and can do whatever they want just because they can. And good people like Gatsby don’t get anything in return. One thing that blew my mind was the symbolism in the novel. If you guys realize the weather represents different conflicts through out the novel. Spring represents rebirth, when Gatsby and Daisy met again. Summer represents the climax of the novel where Tom and Gatsby fight. Fall represents death, as Gatsby dies. I really enjoyed the novel. I would recommend it to everyone who hasn’t read it yet. "
60,Elizabeth Nguyen,"The Great Gatsby was a fantastic book that gave us a real insight into the lives of the rich during the Roaring Twenties. As a ""celebrity"" in New York during this period, Fitzgerald was able to show us ""behind-the-scenes"" of the rich and powerful at the time. (view spoiler)[Although many in my class were upset that Gatsby had died at the end, I felt as if though it wasn't as tragic as everyone made it out to be. His whole life had revolved around Daisy but now that she had choose Tom over him, there was nothing left for Gatsby to live for. He could have gone on to do great things but there was always the chance that he'd become someone who is dead on the inside but not out. Instead, George was able to end his suffering for him. However, that doesn't change the fact that Tom is a horrible person for pointing towards Gatsby's way when George had come to him to ask who had killed Myrtle. (hide spoiler)]Overall it was a great read and the first that was assigned this year that I actually loved! It truly is an American classic!"
61,Miles Mcginley,"The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a book about deception and wealth. Narrated by Nick Carraway, this book takes place in New York during the roaring 20s. Fitzgerald uses his characters to express materialism and greed throughout the duration of the story. At first The Great Gatsby did not interest me as much as it should have. Once the drama and lies began to unfold, I started to enjoy it more. The way Fitzgerald describes the characters gives you an idea of the characters appearance and their mannerisms.I really liked this book because any type of reader enjoy Fitzgerald's writing style. He keeps the reader attached with little hooks that make you glued to the book through every chapter. The dramatic irony gives the reader the ability to make predictions on what will happen further into the book, which mine are usually very inaccurate. My favorite character would most likely be Nick because he is a very calm guy stuck in the middle of a whole load of drama.I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 13 to understand some old-school terms and locations that Fitzgerald uses. I even had trouble with some of his writing. I gave this book five starts out of five because even though I didn't enjoy it in the beginning of the story it definitely grew on me through the second chapter and secrets and lies began which I really enjoyed."
62,Karen Bordner,"I loved this book = again. The tension builds and builds, even when you know what is going to happen. Eager to see the movie with Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby."
63,Elizabeth Atwood,"People hyped this book a lot, and I thought it was good...maybe not as good as I thought it would be/expected it to be."
64,Ciara,"This book can be told just simply through the colours that F. Scott Fitzgerald uses and the construction of his paragraphs and descriptions are flawless, as one of the last paragraphs managed to plunge me into the most melancholic mood that a book has ever evoked from me as a reader. It was also one of the most thought-provoking reads I've ever come across, as Fitzgerald forces you to reflect upon your own self and flaws through revealing the character's imperfections. This then leads you to question whether the flaws of a person hinders them in life or whether it adds to their personality and is therefore beneficial to them as they progress through life. Ultimately, although there were some amazing themes peppered and sometimes developed throughout the book, the theme that really changed my perspective on self and well-being was: Are we always justified if/when we attempt to iron out the flaws of our personality and character in general? Sorry, my rambling and fangirling is complete now xD"
65,Merythapy,"Why we're forced to read this in high school I'll never understand. It doesn't have anything for teenagers-- I'd say you have to be at least 25 to understand this book. As a teenager, the characters were all annoying and vapid and useless. Now, twice as old as when I first read it, I understand them all much more, even if they're still annoying. I like Nick and Gatsby much more, and Nick is less of a nonentity than I first thought he was.This novel says so much about the national American obsession-- wealth (and the wealthy, and making yourself wealthy)-- and how unhealthy it is. It may be that that tour-de-force last page is pointing out the American obsession is with MORE, in any and every form (wealth, land, women, security). Gatsby's obsession with Daisy is revealed to be an obsession with an untouchable past-- as real as the famous green light. America, and certain kinds of Americans in particular, are also obsessed with a largely mythical golden past.This is really is the best answer to The Great American Novel, timeless in that it both prescient and an accurate portrait of a specific moment in time.And that last page is, in my own opinion, the best page ever written in an American novel."
66,Lindsay Leshin,"Fantastic writing! I thought it ended rather abruptly, but it was a pleasure to read!"
67,Rod Van Meter,"Gatsby is a novel about nothing, or about the only thing that matters, depending on your point of view. Its rich, vivid imagery of a decadent time (written at the height of that time, without the benefit of hindsight, increasing the astonishing insight that Fitzgerald showed) is the superficial facade we first see, that view of the Jazz Age, a time of wild parties and alcohol even mid-Prohibition. But its probing of who we are, who we perceive ourselves to be, and who we want to be are the substance behind that facade, supported by beautiful craftsmanship with words, giving it the depth that makes it a classic.The contrast between this and PKD's The Man in the High Castle, the last book I read (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...), could not be more stark; if I had read them in reverse order, I might not have been able to finish High Castle. I read both of these books in my twenties, and have reread them both now, and while the text of the novels doubtless hasn't changed, they are to me completely different novels now than they were then. I spent my teens (and perhaps even earlier) reading science fiction, with not a thought for the quality of the writing but only the galactic scope of their ambition, how breathtaking the ideas could be. In my twenties, the writing began to matter more, so this pair of novels caught me as my tastes were in transition.The best of SF asks us what it means to be human. ""Mayfly"" (Watts and Murphy), ""The Island of the Immortals"" (le Guin), ""Zima Blue"" (Reynolds) ask us in very different ways. The best of ""ordinary"" fiction does the same. In my teens, I would have worshiped the former (still do) and scorned a novel like Gatsby, where nothing much happens. When I read PKD and Gatsby in my twenties, I found myself disappointed in Dick's writing (I still am), but Fitzgerald still elicited only a tickle in my brain stem. Now, I am totally blown away by the writing and the peek into to the soul of Mankind, or at least of Americans.Perhaps it could be said that my more mature tastes reflect ""better"" literature, but I certainly miss being dazzled by the ideas rather than moved by the color and imagery of the words and the depth of emotion. Far too few novels, far too few writers, can do both."
68,Néstor Silverio,"Venture yourself into Gatsby's Mansion in search of an alarming truth, tragedy and the perks of the jazz age. A timeless classic."
69,Seth,An all-time great. One of those books that you can get different things out of every time you read it. Worth revisiting every couple of years. I'm also caught by how much The Long Goodbye echos this novel.
70,Eric Norcross,"The Great Gatsby is one of the greatest pieces of prose ever written in the English language. Most people, especially men, will easily relate to it, especially some of us who have ever obsessed over another person and the nostalgia conveyed within the narrative can easily be applied to the feeling one has when they think about their summers growing up.It's not easy to write a story about a man who completely changes his life to impress a girl. Many questions come out of that very simple concept: like what if he grew up in her class and was able to marry her without discord? Would Gatsby's core be the same? Would he still be so head over heels in love with her that he would change his life? It's a hard question because the romantic in me would like to think that the core is the same, love is love, the reality part of me would say that he probably wouldn't be as obsessed with her. Obsession, to me, stems from not being able to have what you want.Anyway, I could go on and on about this book... until then, beat on... boats against the current born back ceaselessly into the past!"
71,Dexter,"Some adjectives to describe this novel: poetic; wild; lyrical; untamed; lush; beautiful; obsessive. The way that Fitzgerald paints his subjects with emotions and longings brought each of them to life. It is quite clear that The Great Gatsby is not only an American phenomenon, but it is also somewhat of a Greek tragedy akin to Sophocles placed in the time period of a champagne-flowing Jazz Age.Was Jay Gatsby ""great?"" That is left up to the reader to decide. Jim Glatz was without doubt a rare person, a rags to riches story who pulled himself up by his veritable bootstraps, who demonstrated his rarity by not giving way to debauchery himself but to spend his whole life in pursuit of one elusive goal. I conclude that this made him ""great,"" as the title of the novel suggests.What a surprise that I found Gatsby even better than The Beautiful and Damned. Gatsby had more universal emotions within it. Who doesn't have a regret in their life, or have their lives converge upon one central meaning? That fatal, sweltering summer in which the destiny of these characters unfolded in a way depicts all of us."
72,Brad Warren,"Favorite book of all time. Period. It is a great story with many lessons worth learning, even nearly a century after its setting. "
73,Amber Frangos,"An option on the read status should be ""read annually"". I read Gatsby once a year. The prose are seamless as each sentence flows into the next like the gliding of the row boat in the close of the book. One of the reasons I read this every year is I have to quell my mind from the contemporary writing that the publishers tell us needs an in depth, over detailed description of the characters to make it a great write. Do I really need to know the type of toothpaste, toilet paper, if the character has a bunion on their right toe? I do agree that in order for the reader to get to know a character some detail is needed, but current writing loses the essence of the character by overwriting the detail. Gatsby was written during the period when metaphor and the detail assigned to the character was streamline to only define the character. I digress. I admit that occasionally I will read only the last pages of Gatsby to absorb the rhythm of the writing. If beauty can be assigned to words on the page then Fitzgerald succeeds. "
74,Breanne,"I never thought I'd read this book. I'm not American, so I've never had to read it at school. And even though it has popped up on pretty much every ""greatest books of all time"" list ever made, I assumed it was more because of it's American modern historical and cultural relevancy. No offence, but that doesn't appeal to me at all. I finally ended up buying this book when I realised I could get it for $1 at the Kobo store and was really broke. It was probably the best reading decision of my life. While the storyline is interesting, moves quickly and gets you invested in the book, this was not the reason I'm glad I read it. The writing.It's one of the most superbly crafted pieces of literature I've ever read. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a master of the english language, and every sentence was a delight to read. The way he uses metaphors and other literary devices is extraordinary - they give you the most intimate sense of every scene and character, but never get in the way of the story. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves reading the classics and enjoys reading for literary merit. This will not disappoint."
75,Alana Stevens,"This is by far, my most Favorite book. It tells the story of a mysterious millionaire, Jay Gatsby and his love for an old flame, Daisy. Nick Carraway tells the story from his point of view when he spends the Summer in the town of West Egg on Long Island. His neighbor would through the most extravagant parties and was told to be hosted by a man named Gatsby, who was never before seen by his guests. Nick attends one of them and actually meets the man in Question. Nick Carraway is actually Daisy's cousin and learns the rumor that Daisy's husband, Tom, is having an affair. Daisy and Gatsby meet once more at Gatsby's request to have Nick invite her to tea. The story continues as Love is crossed from what is truly coveted with twisted emotions. I wish we were able to know more of Gatsby's past with Daisy and how he could truly be the father of her child. I'd recommend this book to anyone in teens and up. It enthralls you in the scandal  Favorite Line ~""If it wasn't for the mist we could see your home from across the bay,"" said Gatsby. ""You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock."" Daisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occured to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one. ~"
76,Jaimal,I reread this recently and loved it so much more than when I had to read it in high school. Fitzgerald's humor is so much more subtle than most humor writer's today and the funny lines are tucked between such beautifully crafted prose. The story is so simple - basically just describes a few parties at a mysterious Gatsby's mansion - but the humor and just enough foreshadowing keep you wanting to move forward. His observations of the young rich would fit in almost perfectly today. Inspired me to get back to writing my own book!
77,Melissa Engberg,Duh. 
78,Witty yin,"I have been reprimanded by myself after finish reading this classic! I was like: you should read this book much earlier because it was just such a fantastic book!!I t was the kind of book that makes me ponder awhile before writing a review about it because there are just so much quotes and expressive language in the book that I love so much!! Apart from that,I am totally in love with the 1920s!!So exhilarating so eventful but I am also aware that all these excitement would be the cause of someone's unfortunate end. That's what I like about this book too. The message that what you is not all gold~The 1920s as described in the book may be exciting and breathtaking but the downfalls of it are : people in that kind scene turned out to be very impersonal and selfish,just like Gatsby's friends and old love,Daisy.Only Nick who is a favorite character of mine dares to stand his ground for what he believed in and not betray his morally view of looking at things. This is what I like so much about Nick Carraway and he would definitely be someone I held resect to ."
79,Peter Tieryas,"I was worried I had nothing to add if I were to do a review on The Great Gatsby as pretty much everything to say about the book has been said. So I took on a different approach, talking about the Great Gatsby video game, Great Gatsby movie, as well as the famous novel and their intersections at HTMLGiant:http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/25-point..."
80,Joleen,"First off let me say, my teacher was a whole lot of biased when she told us she hated this book and wasn't going to let us read it, which I thought was totally wrong. Then top it all off she made us watch the old version of the movie, which I thought was awful. But when I read this book. It was like my whole world was just opened up to something new.
Reading this book, In felt like there was depth to each person. Like Daisy wasn't just some bubbled headed blonde and she wasn't oblivious like people made her out to be. Then their Gatsby, by all time favorite love. I like to think there's more to Gatsby than people see. He was honestly the most hopeful person, throughout this whole story, even after Myrtle is ran over. He wants what every person wants, to just go back, and have things the way they where. 
"
81,Megan Gleason,"One of favorite books that I re-read every summer. With each year, the story and words mean something new, especially after having lived in New York for ten years. Fitzgerald is my favorite writer and, for me, The Great Gatsby is the writer at his best. The author edits his words beautifully and captures the story of Gatsby, a man that was so much like himself-mysterious, seeking to live a life that was beyond his reach. It's easy to be the outsider looking in--like Nick--and to see the world as it really is. But it makes you wonder if Gatsby's internal dreams of love made his life more rich than most--and if the imagination makes life more beautiful."
82,Alondra,"I've always heard people talk about how inspiring the great Gatsby was to them but i never really had the chance to read or see it. now that i got the opportunity to read the great Gatsby i truly understood why everyone would say such good things about this book but in my own point of view what i really enjoyed about this book was the whole use of color imagery for example my favorite/important to me were gold,white,green because throughout the book these were the most colors used and had a greater or deeper meaning to it, in my opinion the color white represents hope just like Gatsby hoping to be with Daisy again, white can also go for good things heading along the way. The color gold symbolizes power, control,wealth that represents Gatsby and how his wealth became so extreme to the point where he can do whatever he pleased and lastly the green was meant for lack of need for example in the book Gatsby reaches over his hands over to the green light wishing to have Daisy back in his arms but he knows deep down that he cant succeed due to him not being edge able to fight for daisy due to her being married and Gatsby leaving Daisy when they were together. Another thing i like about this book is how it has fulfilling quotes one of my favorites is ''whenever you feel like criticizing anyone'', he told me, ''just remember that all people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.''(Fitzgerald 1) now lastly the best thing i love about this book is how you can easily compare both streetcar named desire and great Gatsby together! they both relate to whole aspect of irony, the american dream, the high quality of symbolism, and same similarity's between both Daisy,Blanche,Gatsby,Stanley,Daisy's husband. therefore i suggest people that haven't read the book to read!"
83,Laura Galindo,"Great Gatsby brought things to my attention about literature that I never really cared for before, such as the difference between grand metaphor use and delightfully subtle metaphor use. It was an interesting display of the American 1920's, and throughout the book I felt like I was witnessing a different world in play. Naturally, I felt myself attracted to Gatsby's character, but soon I realized that Gatsby was just as (if not more) flawed as the other characters and more importantly, myself. Nearing the last couple of chapters, I realized that this story was created to be everything that it's synopsis is not. Perhaps Gatsby cared for Daisy- but no where near as much as he cared about the title of her money. I have grown an interest for the 20's since, and the festive and extravagant air that rang throughout this time only made the 30's that much more tragic. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a great story, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is looking to deeply digest a novel. I look forward to a life of returning to this novel every now and again, hopefully to find something new every time and to savor old thoughts again. "
84,Margaret Stohl,"I think my number two all time book, after To Kill A Mockingbird."
85,Christina,"I'm positive almost everyone educated in an American public high school has read this book, so I doubt I have anything original to add. But oh my, The Great Gatsby is everything I long for in a novel.I remember reading it in high school as a required assignment, but I must have been in a funk the whole time because when I picked it up again earlier this month, I could not recall any sort of detail. It's amazing how the same books can affect you in completely different and unexpected ways depending on where you are in your life when you read them. When I read The Great Gatsby in high school, I was jaded and sick of scrutinizing every inch of every book. Reading it a second time almost eight years later with a fresh set of eyes, I fell in love.For me, the biggest draw is Fitzgerald's writing style. It's a bit ironic that I'm a fan of Ray Bradbury as well, yet he and Fitzgerald could not be more stylistically opposed. Bradbury is the king of long, wispy descriptions that transport you into a hazy dream world. But Fitzgerald's writing is clean, simple, elegant, beautiful, streamlined, and best of all, witty. His one-liners are undoubtedly the best.I can't wait to read more of F. Scott Fitzgerald's works. And for the few of you who haven't experienced The Great Gatsby yet -- give it a whirl, old sport."
86,Christine,"One of my all-time favorites! I had to read it for my AP English class in high school, and I loved it. The movie with Robert Redford is really well-done, too, if you happen to like to see companion movies. They're often not as good (actually, in my opinion, they're never as good) but this one is all right. Definitely a classic worth reading..."
87,Javier Bernaldo,"The Great Gatsby has been one of the best books I have read. It interests many people because it can relate to hardships of peoples lives, financial problems, and even day to day troubles. One thing that can be taken away from this novel is that not everything in life is given to you. Gatsby worked his entire life o become rich and try and repeat the past. Secondly, one can not repeat the past. A person could try and simulate the past, but never be the exact same. Finally, Gatsby is selfish in the sense of only wanting Daisy and not worrying about anything else. This does not block out the fact that he worked his entire life for it and never gave up on his dream of reliving the past. Even though he wasn't the best person out there, I admire his devotion and endurance towards achieving his ultimate goal."
88,Emerginme,"I am a member of one of the loveliest local book clubs. Eight women, totally colorful, who come from different roots, origins, religions, beliefs and ages. You name it, she is there. I love it because it is so different and so unique. Everybody’s agendas are different and there is no judgment around that.We have recently finished a book known as “American’s greatest novel ever written”, Great Gatsby by Scott Fitzgerald. It was one of the rare books that everyone liked in the club. It was my second time reading the same book. I was totally surprised that how different the impact was this time around than before.Yes, I loved the plot and the narrative. Such an amazing and delicate descriptive language! Similes, metaphors and other writing techniques were all beautifully used. But more than anything, the characters, the story, and the morale were not really away from our current experiences.We have plenty of people around us, similar to those characters that is to say either bullies or very weak ones, or the ones who have self-esteem but do nothing to be near to the strong. Strong is too strong. He has got it all. This is what capitalism has brought to human nature. Success has changed its meaning. Success is now measured with money. How much you gain, how much you earn. If you have got money, we think you have got it all!This book is so well outlined in service of criticizing this culture. It is striking when the story takes you to one of those ostentatious, glamorous parties where everybody acts and pretends to be somebody else. Have you ever been one of those parties? It is really funny. You end up talking to many people, yet you have got this metallic taste of artificialness all over you. We all put too many layers of different identities on our shoulders and we never understand whom we actually talk to in this world of glamour. We never ever show our vulnerable sides and pretend to be strong human beings. We love to be with the strong and associated with the strong because it is the best way to cover our own fragilities.Great Gatsby has become one of the greatest novels of the American Literature, because it was the self-critic of the society of its own. Like Master and the Margarita for Russia. We need more of those books; we need to have more of the self-criticism and being brave to speak about our weaknesses. We need to become naturally us, without our masks or fixed identities."
89,A.J.,"I first read F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterwork my freshman year of high school. That was about ten years ago. What a difference a decade makes. Holy fuck!My first non-story related impression was that this book should immediately be stripped from all required reading lists in all high school English classes. The reason is––and here I'm not trying to be deliberately condescending––that both from my own personal experience of being a high schooler who read it and knowing a lot more high schoolers who might read it, I'll flatly assert that very few if any of them will have the capacity for appreciating or understanding much of anything going on here. I say that because I had no capacity for appreciating or understanding much of anything going on there. Now, a little older and a little better read, the true depths of the book are slightly clearer. The Great Gatsby is not the only story of its kind or the only story about disillusionment. A lot of the best fictional works out there across a variety of mediums have a core theme that when the party stops, when the guests drive off down the road, and the last of the booze is drained, we look back to find there was never anything tangible there at all. The illusion of wealth and success and happiness was just that––an illusion, and beneath it all the time was an aching emptiness.At some point while working on Gatsby, Fitzgerald wrote his editor and said, ""I feel an enormous power in me now, more than I've ever had."" Without context the statement could mean a number of things, but I like to imagine that he's referring to his prose. I like to imagine that because it helps explain the sheer magnitude and gravity of this writing. Writing like this doesn't happen every day or to every author. The ability to infuse irony and humor with profundity, to turn moods on a dime through language, and to craft a story that all at once addresses characters, an age, and even a nation––(holy fuck!)––is simply incredible.Five stars and an Orson Welles clap. I'll write a note to myself to read it in another ten years, if I survive that long. I'll be sure to expand the review if I do. Until then, onward, boats against the current."
90,Zayden,"I choose to read this book because it was one of the few classic books I have heard of, and one of the few with good ratings. I liked this book because it gives you a flash of the past very well. It gives a view on the upper class Americas back then. It is also not one of those boring stories or happy ever after ones, it has a sad ending to it with a death. From the book I learnt that money can't by anyone happiness, it may for a short period but not for ever. Jay Gatsby wanted to be happy he wanted daisy, but never got her, he tried to get her by showing of his riches but failed and sadly died with no one in his life but Nick. My favorite character is Nick Carraway, he is both narrator and participant in this story. Nick is a focal point of the story, while at the same time allowing him to remain in the background as a narrator. Also Nick has the honor of being the only character who changes who he really is from the star of the story to its end. Nick at the start seems like an outside character with not much relation to the story but slowly moves to becoming an important person in the novel.Overall this book is a fantastic tale and I would recommend reading it. "
91,Kameron,"Ok. I don't like writing reviews. I'm going to try, although this is more of a review of Nick, the main character... The Great Gatsby is filled with possible the most beautiful sentences ever constructed in the history of mankind. I am liable to exaggerate, but I am currently focused on reading it for the second time.  Have you ever read a piece of writing that just kind of makes a giant warm smile appear on your face? Not like laughing out loud (although I have done that while reading this, too *nerd*), but just a warm smile where you feel the intensity touch your face from the pages? The Great Gatsby is one of those pieces of writing for me. Nick... Nick... I love Nick. I would honestly want to be best friends with Nick. Nick is no question one of my favorite protagonists that I've ever had the pleasure to satiate my mind with. Nick is possibly the only reason I even enjoy this book. Fitzgerald constructs his sentences so carefully, and you can feel it. If you open the book to any random page, and select a sentence to read aloud it is absolutely beautiful. Honestly. The way Nick observes people sometimes get stuck in your mind and you copy the things he does in real life. I don't know if anyone else has ever felt this while reading this, but it's my personal review.  When I read novels or anything (something I learned from my girlfriend), I like to underline or mark parts of the book that I absolutely fall in love with. It was so hard not underlining that entire book. It was. I swear there are paragraphs underlined. Let me rewrite a portion.  ""Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.""The book is completely filled with that kind of stuff, which I find extremely interesting to read.  Not to mention the symbolism! The symbolism is extremely interesting in this book, as Fitzgerald leaves it to the reader alone to interpret it. The green light and the massive eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg to name two. Two of the main ones anyway. I honestly don't feel like writing this anymore, and I have homework. But I loved this book I did. I would recommend this book to anyone. Any religion, any race, any age."
92,Krystena Tharman,"The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a fantastic book. I would not mind reading this book again. I could not put it down. I sat down in one day and read the whole thing from the first to the last page. Basically it is one big scandal in the love lives of Daisy, Tom (her husband), Tom’s mistress Mrs. Myrtle Wilson, and James Gatsby. Nick, the main character, is dragged into trying to fix and hide all these different love games which end up causing him to throw his life away to better theirs without really noticing. The author’s purpose is to show the roaring 20s, all the craziness, parties, clothes, drugs, and alcohol. It was when the girls started to lose their corsets and wear more revealing clothes, and they didn’t want to be the perfect lady. I think F. Scott Fitzgerald did a wonderful job in showing the time period. Everything in the book was so free and extravagant. Gatsby was always throwing wonderful parties, and the author always went into detail always managing to incorporate the drunken, ambitious ambiance of them. People just showed up without knowing Gatsby, it was just one big party. Nick’s, the main character, first experience was, “I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby’s house I was one of the few guests who had actually been invited. People were not invited—they went there… Sometimes they came without having met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission.” These things were really captured in the book, and that made it easy to understand which gave me a sense of what the 20s were like when the ban on alcohol was lifted and everyone wanted to party hard. I would definitely recommend this book to most anyone. However, I think the age level should be about twelve at minimum. It may be a great romance, but it is also full of mystery and action. It surprised me quite a bit on how the romance wasn’t the main focus. The main focus was more on the scandal. The beginning is a little slow, but it picks up fast. Once it did pick up, I couldn’t stop reading it. Not only was it interesting, but I also thought it was beautifully written. The author was great at phrasing things. Even the general tone was captivating. Overall, I loved everything about this book. There was no flaw to it in my opinion, and the author wrote beautifully."
93,Manel,"Dreams are nothing more than a mirror that make us run otherwise towards our past, giving it a twist, dressing it up like a future.It's the only way everything makes sense, and that's what Fitzgerald teaches us with this amazing parable about dreams and loneliness, about time that passes us by, about love without love."
94,Carley Seekamp,"This was my second time reading Great Gatsby I chose to read it again because the emotional benefits gained from reading a book or watching a movie for a second time help people become more in touch with themselves. This book was under my radar for a while, I’m glad I got to read it because for such a short novel it contains great life lessons. I will share a few of those lessons that I learned. For one it’s not easy to leave your past behind you. The past can be a messy thing to escape, as hard as Gatsby tries to dodge his reputation as a bootlegger, he’s unable to do so. Another lesson is that you can’t assume anything without the full truth. When George finds out that his wife has died after being hit by Gatsby’s car, he automatically assumes it was Gatsby, and immediately proceeds to get revenge. Another life lesson that should be obvious is that money can’t buy you friends or love. Gatsby attempts to pursue Daisy with his luxurious mansion where he throws fancy parties. Ultimately he fails, mainly because of his illegal bootlegging. The worst part is that none of Gatsby’s party guests show up to his funeral, besides Nick. I read that many consider The Great Gatsby to be depressing because, in the end, those who dream do not achieve their aspirations. However, the main message that Fitzgerald sends to us isn't that dreaming will lead to despair, but that chasing an unworthy dream will lead to tragedy. At first I thought the book was really light and easy, but as I read on I found it became deeper and I fell into it as I went along. Not only was this book a very deep examination of the life of the rich in the Twenties, but actually about human nature and the effects of too much money and time. I really loved the way the Twenties were so clearly evoked, I felt the atmosphere of Gatsby’s parties so clearly. Overall I really enjoyed reading this book, and I would highly suggest it to any of my friends!-Carley"
95,Nancy Medina,"- Tenía un don extraordinario para saber esperar, una romántica presteza que jamás he hallado en otra persona, & que no es probable que vuelva a encontrar. No; en resumen, Jay Gatsby resultó ser un hombre de una pieza.- Era una de esas raras sonrisas, con una calidad de eterna confianza, de esas que en toda la vida no se encuentran mas que 4 o 5 veces. Contemplaba, parecía contemplar por un instante el Universo entero, & luego se concentraba en uno con irresistible parcialidad; comprendía a uno hasta el límite en que uno deseaba ser comprendido, creía en uno como uno quisiera creer en sí mismo, & aseguraba que se llevaba la mejor impresión que uno quisiera producir. - Todos creemos que, como mínimo, poseemos una virtud capital; la mía es esta: soy una de las pocas personas honradas que he conocido."
96,Luísa,"""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
97,Robert Kristoffersen,"It seemed like 2006 was only yesterday, or maybe last week, and I was listening to a band called Gatsby's American Dream. Finally, six years later, I've read about that dream, and have come to the conclusion that it is indeed great.The title of this novel reads like an advertisement for a circus attraction. Indeed, he does come off like it; as an unconventional man, Gatsby is a non-drinker who made his money off of Prohibition, a swimming pool owner that doesn't swim, and as his car is described, ""a circus wagon."" Despite being a tragic character, Gatsby is indeed great. Our narrator, Nick Carraway, goes so far as to say ""Gatsby turned out all right in the end; it is what preyed upon Gatsby..."" Gatsby's dream is painted in tragedy as his dreams are grounded, but hard to realize.His great dream leads to Daisy Buchanan, the apple of his eye, and if the light at the end of her dock is any indication, Gatsby likes his apples green. Daisy is Gatsby's past, but in the novel he seeks to make that past the present. To set things up though, her husband, Tom Buchanan, may be the most deplorable character I've ever read, and to Gatsby's detriment. Tom likes to take credit for things he's never done, he cheats on his wife, and he hits women. Gatsby almost, successfully gets Daisy back, though through a sad tragedy and morbid aftermath, this crisis is averted. Even so, Gatsby's dream of erasing Tom Buchanan from Daisy's past is a futile one; their three year old daughter is proof of that. But, Gatsby's hopes of living in that alternate 1985 are so desirable, that despite all of his faults he's a sympathetic character. You're rooting for him all the way!The great, larger theme here is how that American dream; of money, power, provenance, and that care free life, have their own sets of tragedies. While yellow may be associated with free market flair and prestige, it oversees a lot of death in this novel. The fact that yellow is everywhere in this novel, seems like it should be overbearing, but it never comes across as such. Instead, the rich become tragically rich and careless. Well, they may have been careless the whole time.Whatever your hesitations, this is a novel for the ages, and one that should be read at least once. Even if you don't like it, Gatsby's ambition is not unlike the common man. While wealth makes this tale even more tragic, if you remove it, you will still find everybody whoever lived; living that beautiful, sad, tragic dream. "
98,Michael Curry,"I don't think I have ever had a favorite book until I read the Great Gatsby. This book takes place in the times of the Jazz Era where the stock market boomed, and the want for money grew higher and higher. Each Saturday night Jay Gatsby throws immense parties in hopes to find his long lost lover Daisy Buchanan. Nick Caraway the man narrating this novel is instantly likable. He seems to be the only one who is reasonable throughout the entire story. He moves right next door to Mr. Gatsby and just happens to be Daisy's distant cousin. Nick feeling pressured to do so, he tries to bring the lovers together after five years of separation. As Gatsby's and Daisy's love is re-fueled, Tom Buchanan balances between his wife that he pushes further and further away, and an affair with a girl named Myrtle who lives in the Valley of Ashes. The three duke it out in this love triangle that seems to be going in circles. As things get said, and one thing leads to another many innocent lives are taken while this shenanigan is taking place. In this dramatic love story F. Scott Fitzgerald perfectly displays these characters. As the book progresses he slowly chips away and reveals who they truly are. Word Count:215 "
99,Gabby," The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald was an extremely fast pasted book. It involved murder, adultery, and criticism done to one an other. The main characters Daisy, Gatsby, Tom, and Nick were all people that over looked who they were. I believed the most interesting part of the book was when Gatsby and Daisy finally fell for each other all over again and caused Tom to finally think twice about the situation he was in and realize what he had to do to get his true love back before he was left with nothing but his mistress Myrtle Wilson. The book was a thriller causing me to be able to expect anything that was thought possible to happen. Daisy the wife of Tom played her character very well and her role in the book was thought out well because in order for Tom to be able to cheat he had to have a wife that felt less powerful and helpless to approach the situation that he was seeing another woman while married.  This book would be something I would recommend to someone. Even though this book was written awhile back it still caught my attention and encouraged me to read further. I liked this book as well because it made me think about what was happening and what could happen. The way Gatsby the mysterious character of all of them met Nick was strange to me. I felt like Gatsby was to obsessed with Daisy and at the end of the book it made me feel like Gatsby never cared after all those years he hadn't seen Daisy. I believe Gatsby just wanted the satisfaction that Daisy would hurt Tom for him by saying ""I never loved you"". I think this because he was so determined to get that one line out of Daisy. I also felt like Gatsby used Nick in order to get to Daisy. I believe he would have never sent him a personal invitation to come to his party or spend time with him. Then again Gatsby used many people from selling fake bonds to inviting people for his entertainment and being able to fill his big house. The only time I felt like Gatsby was actually caring was when he took the blame for Daisy when knowingly that he would most likely get caught because Daisy ran over Myrtle Wilson with Gatsby's car. Due to that accident and Gatsby's love for Daisy I believe this caused the who.e tragedy of the book. If only myrtle wasn't In love with Tom causing her to run after Gatsby's car which she thought belonged to Tom. Since George was good friends with Tom who was having an affair with his wife told him that it was his car and was just offering it for sell, George knew how to track the car down and kill the murder of his wife and end his misery. "
100,Kayley Ryan,"The Great Gatsby was full of symbolic meaning, subtle themes and messages that edged their way into the readers' minds through the intense drama that ensues within the book. It's not just a romance, or a book of scandal and drama, it's a book about changing the times, going from simplicity to complexity, traditional novels to the truly ""American"" novel that F. Scott Fitzgerald so elegantly penned. This story has its share of drama, clashes between man vs. society and man vs. man, romance, etc., but it's not just the story that gets me. It's the way he writes, the way he makes you sit on the edge of your seat waiting for what will happen next, the way no matter how many times you read it you'll always get something new out of it, and especially, the way that reading and beginning to comprehend the characters in the book will help you to see into the society of the time, and maybe even into yourself. Amid all the dramatic clashes between characters in early 20th century New York, one discovers the theme of the American Dream, that fading glory that everyone aspires to, but not everyone gets. "
101,Riley Young," The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald was written to exploit the American dream. Fitzgerald recognizes the ridiculousness of the dream and demonstrates its true extent in his novel. The upper class of the time had a similar picture perfect world as to today, sex without repercussions.  The author wrote this book to show the emptiness of the American dream. Fitzgerald tells a story of a man and his ex-lover whom wanted to recreate the past. The idea is self-absorbent and impossible. The true absurdity of the pursuit of this dream is clearly pictured. When Gatsby is murdered for ,in turn, his own actions by a lower class citizen it is demoralizing. This book achieves its archive in demonstrating the emptiness of the American dream. The theme is also the hollowness of the dream and some things can not be recreated. The two affairs that occur are both inappropriate but different. Gatsby and Daisy are old lovers and wanted to make the past be present. Although Jay was not rude in his manner, Tom Buchanan practically stole the mechanic's wife. The upper class was corrupt and full of hollow relationships. Daisy wanted the past, yet she enjoyed the present. Her and Gatsby's relationship was impossible to recreate and was caused because of a hollow relationship between Daisy and Tom. Effectively, Fitzgerald tells the story from a descriptive view from Nick Carraway. Nick describes the events that happen day to day. The book is best in a first person perspective because it leaves a mysterious aspect on the character's feelings. The reader is left guessing and taking sides by interpreting the actions for the emotions that fit. Due to the similarity between then and now, the novel is timeless. I liked the book because of the mature topics and intense story. In a way, the book is relatable. The plot is slightly different with a late climax. The car crash ties everything together in the end. In all, the novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald is great; I would recommend it to someone."
102,Kulaithim_a_140518,"F.Scott Fitzgerald a name that shined in the history of American literacy, who’s also known for THE great American novel ( The Great Gatsby) . You can not seem to deny the fact that this is one of the greatest literature pieces in terms of using an outstanding yet so elegant choice of vocabulary . It’s one of those books that you can’t seem to stay away off due to the vividness of the writing . It’s a classical romance a story of love and hate all together a story that shows how hallow and shallow some people may be or even dreams. The story also describes what seems to be “ THE AMERICAN DREAM “ for some and the reality for others . As I quote “ I dare you not to fall in love with the novel “"
103,Erienne Jones,"Review originally posted here: http://fictionfinders.blogspot.com/20...In the summer of 1922, 29 year old Nick Carraway has just moved from Minnesota to New York. Nick rents a house in the West Egg district of Long Island. West Egg is mostly populated with the newly rich who do not have many social connections and tend to find ways to elaborately display their wealth. Jay Gatsby, Nick's next door neighbor is known for his extravagant weekly parties that are overflowing with alcohol and people Gatsby doesn't know. In contrast, East Egg is a very fashionable area that is home to the more established upper class. While Nick lives in West Egg, he has family connections in East Egg and decides to pay them a visit shortly after moving to New York. Daisy Buchanan (Nick's cousin) and her husband Tom are the exact representation of those living in East Egg. They are extremely wealthy and seem to be living the ""American Dream."" While Daisy and Tom appear to be happy and content, Nick soon learns that Tom is having an affair. Soon after his visit with Tom and Daisy, Nick is invited to one of Gatsby's famous parties. He knows no one at the party until he runs into Jordan Baker, a friend of Daisy's. This is also where Nick meets Gatsby for the first time. Nick and Gatsby end up becoming friends and Nick discovers that Gatsby and Daisy were lovers before he went off to war and Gatsby has moved to West Egg with the sole purpose being to rekindle his lost love with Daisy. My Thoughts:The Great Gatsby is one of those books I was supposed to read in high school, but didn't. I didn't become an avid reader until I was in college, so I regrettably read the Cliff Notes instead of the actual book. I decided that I was going to read this book before the new movie came out. I read it in just a couple sittings and found myself very intrigued with the story and the characters. They all seemed to be pursuing wealth and social status with the idea that it would bring them joy and happiness. I love how F. Scott Fitzgerald shatters this idea by showing a group of people who are wealthy and have a great social standing, but are ultimately unhappy. The Great Gatsby is by no means a story that makes you warm and fuzzy inside, but it is a story that shows how, in and of themselves, the pursuit of wealth and prestige will not make us happy. "
104,Abi,"I'm not really sure what the deal is with the 'Great American Novel'... I'm certain there's no search for the elusive 'Great English Novel' or the 'Great French Novel'... why do Americans want their entire country and experience to be summed up by a single work of literature? I confess I don't understand.For me, as a non-American, this book was about America, yes, but that wasn't the be all and end all of it. I understood the whole critique of the American dream thing (or should Dream be capitalised there?), of course. What captured me was the tragic plight of Gatsby as a man driven by his own delusions, his almost monomaniacal obsession with Daisy Buchannan, and the interplay between reality and illusion. And that illusion doesn't have to be the American Dream of 'rags to riches' success; the commentary is much more universal. I found it genuinely poignant to read about Gatsby as the man who has everything and yet has nothing, desperately a la recherche du temps perdu. Ultimately, he is more complete whilst he is yearning for Daisy, wrapped up in his own fantasy, than he could possibly be once he grasps that fantasy and watches it turn to dust in his hands. I loved the part where Nick leaves Gatsby outside the Buchannan's house late at night, 'watching over nothing'. The Great Gatsby was a brilliant short novel, and I really should have read it sooner."
105,Sara,"I haven't read The Great Gatsby since high school, and I'd forgotten how good it is. The movie sparked my interest in rereading it, and, while I have my criticisms of the new movie, I found it fairly accurate in the feeling of the book. That said, as I was rereading, I was impressed with the subtlety of the narration (which isn't so true of the movie). Nick Carraway's voice shows his ambiguous and complicated feelings, and Fitzgerald's writing is lush and nuanced. I haven't read anything else by Fitzgerald (it seems most everyone has only read The Great Gatsby because they were required to in high school), but now I want to."
106,Andrew Perron,"I expected this book to be nothing but a bunch of shallow rich people being dicks to each other. And I mean, it has that - but it also has a lot of naked, raw emotion, and shallow rich people breaking down and showing their human flaws, and those flaws leading to tragedy that you can feel. Yeah, I'd say this one deserves its ""classic"" status.Also, (view spoiler)[Daisy is clearly the most interesting character, having hollowed herself out into ""just a fool"" to survive in a patriarchal world, and then becoming just an object for two people she cares desperately, painfully about. Nick lumping her in with Tom at the end is a massive disservice - even if she does knowingly do a horrible thing. (hide spoiler)]"

108,Brian,The Great Gatsby is a book that's been talked about since it was written. I finally got around to reading it. I generally knew the story already through peers and after seeing the movie. The style and the prose of Fitzgerald is great. I enjoyed this book very much. I also enjoyed the relationship between Jay and Nick. There's a lot of subtle messages I feel about relationships in this book. It's also interesting to get a taste of the times and how people with wealth felt untouchable almost during this time period. It was sad that Jay never got the woman he fell in love for. 
109,Gabrielle W,"The Great Gatsby is about a man named Nick Caraway moves into a small house neighbor to a momentous mansion and across the lake from his cousin Daisy. When he goes to Daisy's for dinner along with Daisys husband Tom Buchanon and her friend Jordan Baker where they begin to talk about his house and his mysterious neighbor Gatsby. A young extremely rich man who throws large parties all the time for no reason. But when Daisy hears her husband talk about Gatsby she seems entrigued as if she's met Gatsby before but no one knows why. The next day Nick gets an invitation from Gatsby to one of his big parties. And meets Jordan at the party when he asks if she was invited but she exclaims no one gets invited they all just come. But while at the party he asks around about Gatsby and gets a differant definition from each person he talks to, no one seems to know who he actually is. Until he meets Gatsby and he is a nice charming man around his early 30s. After talking he goes off to take a call and requests for Jordan to come to his office. When she comes out later and tells Nick that they have to get together for tea so she can tell him about the big secret Gatsby told her, as she leaves the party. When they get together she tells Nick that Gatsby and Daisy use to be in love, until he had to leave and when he returned, he spent all of his money on a large house and big extravagant parties hoping one day that one day she would wander in. Now that Nick knows Gatsby uses him as a pawn to get Daisy back, Tom uses Nick to keep the secret that he's cheating on Daisy, and Disy uses Nick to help her get Gatbsy back. Wich leads to drama,fights, love, and loss. "
110,Luis Serrano,"The Great Gatsby is an incredible story. It describes different aspects of life. Fitzgerald knew what he was writing. The characters might not be likable, which is an abundant complaint, but I think that is just what makes this book a joy to read. You have these different worlds colliding with one anther until one is push down & the other victorious. If you like things to be said straight forward, you might want to pick another book to read. The Great Gatsby is full of enigmatic messages. Fitzgerald places Jay Gatsby in the story to be the enigma of the story. Every character in the book represents something; I won't tell you want they represent, but I can assure you that each and every character represents something more than a just a common variable of the plot. Why should you read it? The book gives you not just a good story but also a meaningful theme."
111,Liz,"
“So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”


This book represents the Roaring Twenties, it shows the frivolous and greedy life-style of this time. And Mr. Gatsby is part of this grandiose world of money, parties and hope for a new beginning. He celebrates the biggest parties, welcomes the most famous guests and has the most careless life. 

The rumors about him are absurd, nobody knows his past, his story and nobody is actually interested in it. Except maybe Nick who is soon standing between Gatsby and the Buchanan family. 

This book was surprisingly captivating with all the parties and careless lifes of the characters. Suddenly, I felt like a part of the luxurious world I always despised. The money, the ambition, the parties were everywhere yet the people who lived this life were lost and they were lonely. Gatsby embodied the loneliness of this life-style.He was a self-made millionare who lived just for one dream. Who fought for one dream and who actually had nobody because of this dream. He was a walking mystery. Kind, hospitable and extravagant on the one hand and secretive and lonely on the other. I felt sorry for him and his life and at the same time I felt with him because he actually lived a life everyone dreams about but not everyone is strong enough to live.Daisy was charming and she seemed more stupid than she actually was, but nevertheless I felt like she didn't deserve Gatsby. He was too good for her. Nick was a bit clumsy if you ask me. He never knew what exactly to do and often kept his opinion for himself when it was better to say something.He had lots of negative character traits and modes of behaviour which I despised but on the other hand he developed thanks to Gatsby and in the end he was a strong, loyal and direct person. Just like Nick, I did not quite like Tom who acted contradictory and disrespectful many times and neither did I like the bossy and spoiled Jordan Baker, but all of them showed that they have both good and bad sides in the end. 
“I was within and without. Simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.”
The love-story or rather love-stories in this book were strong. What Gatsby felt for Daisy and how much he was ready to do for her was stunning and it was real. This love was deep and it was possessive and it was desperate in so many ways. It was not the main part of the book, and it wasn't mentioned that often, but I could feel it in every line. The other love-stories were partly affairs, partly just affection or distraction from the exhausting greedy life. But all of them were real and natural and we often see these ""types"" of love in the real life too. What I loved most about this book was the fact that the nowadays society isn't much different from the society in the book and I don't mean it in a positive way. This book criticized the human beings in so many ways, it showed the worst but it showed the worst in a charming and captivating way. It showed longing for more, wrong decisions, loneliness and betrayal, hope for a new start and it showed right decisions and sacrifice and loyalty. This book deserves to be called a Classic and it can teach the people a lot. It shows all the wrong's and it animates to do things actually right. Highly recommended to everyone! I am incredibly happy that I finally read this book!
“And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter—to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning——So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”

112,Shallyann,"I don't know why i find myself re reading this particular book when i'm sad, i just know it somehow makes me happy even though the ending isn't happy. Probably because of the story, and the setting. It is all so beautiful a the author once again captivates my heart with such grace. "
113,Ashlee Shirk,"The Great Gatsby was a very well written book. Fitzgerald did a wonderful job at creating a very well understood book that makes you want to keep reading. I enjoyed the book very much. I would honestly read it again. The story line takes place in the 1920s when everyone wanted to drink, party, and have a good time. Throughout the entire book, Fitzgerald uses many techniques to keep his reader interested in the story. From parties to murder you will want to keep reading and find out what happens next."
114,Evey Morgan,"Magnífico, brillante, obra maestra.... son calificativos como estos los que puedo aplicar a esta novela que he devorado en un día.La pluma de FitzGerald es exquisita y tiene un modo de narrar que embelesa al lector. Con unos personajes impecables llenos de dobles y múltiples lecturas al igual que la historia que cuentan. Hay demasiados pasajes que reseñar, muchas frases marcadas con post it. Es de esas historias que dejan huella en quien las lee. Ya es la segunda vez este mes que me ocurre lo mismo. Este libro pasa directamente al estante dedicado al de mis libros favoritos."
115,Haya S.,"After three years of constantly hearing people extoling The Great Gatsby, I have finally read it and only now do I truly realize that their remarks were just. See, I can blather endlessly about my favorite characters and scenes but I will highlight the most important factor of this book's popular appeal - its themes.Firstly, I reckon Fitzgerald's pivotal intention was to shed light on the hallowness of the opulent class in America in the 1920's. Throughout the book, Gatsby's lavish parties' attendees have nothing to do all day but wander from a party to another, not necessarily having previous acquaintances with the host. As long as it's a party, people will go.Secondly, I believe the book illustrates the weakness of money as Gatsby who owns a mansion and throws parties every now and then cannot win the heart of a beautiful woman he has always sought - Daisy. Clear as it is, I believe it is indeed a main theme of this book.Thirdly, speaking of Gatsby's parties, Fitzgerald explicitly showed the importance of personal acquaintances in life. Take a look at Gatsby whose parties were attended by almost everyone but when it was time for his funeral, everyone had somewhere else to be, some even had picnics as their excuses... :/ Apologizing for the long review, I can assure you that all those positive attributes you have heard and read about this novel are true for despite the book's brevity in only a hundred and eighty pages, the book's themes and motifs are entirely influential, not to mention endless, and deeply needed to be studied carefully to correct the common misconceptions about Life. :) Thank you for reading my review. :)x"
116,Rhi,Re-read June 2012. Review to come.
117,Charlie Wahnon,"A story that glorifies love, painted with the shiniest lights in the most beautiful places, and the fake smiles of those who pretend to care and love.Couldn't stop reading, and couldn't help falling a bit in love with Mr. Gatsby myself."
118,Jack,"'Gatsby' begins promising but slowly, and quickly culminates into what many describe as the waking from a dream. The tragic character of Jay Gatsby explores immorality--Fitzgerald using Nick as a window--of a century. Nick observes the collapse of Gatsby's delusion of happiness from afar as the characters destroy themselves. His unrequited love for Daisy consumes him. He fights to re-write the past, but he knows unconsciously that it cannot be done. ""Why of course you can!"" he says earnestly in rejection.I cannot say how much I loved this book. I disliked most of the characters, through extramarital affairs, and tragedies, but the plot is more than a love story. It is a social commentary to the unjust of a time period. Nick leaves the East to forget what happened to him--to Gatsby. The end of the novel references again the impossibility to chase a dream of the past.This novel is a thin but enormous book, and every word vibrates with symbolism and connections. The descriptive language is appealing, but it can annoyingly misconstrue the plot at times. The intra-social cast of characters are only but a part of the plot. Each one is obviously meticulously conceived, and each one is intentionally shallow and lost. It is impossible to recommend this classic enough. This novel has verbalized a motif that I have long had in my head, and I am more than pleased."
119,Miranda,"This was the second time I had taught The Great Gatsby as a text, and I spent more time with specific passages this time, since my Diploma students were using it to prepare for the Individual Oral Commentary, which requires students to do a very close reading of a brief passage from one of the books studied that term. So we ripped certain passages to shreds, noticing just about EVERYTHING there was to see on the lines and in between. And, as a result, I developed a deepened respect for Fitzgerald. His use of language coupled with the creation of psychological dimension in his characters makes this a book that you really should reread ... perhaps as many times as possible. (And watching the various film versions as a way to compare and contrast with the text is an entertaining exercise!) I suppose what I find the least appealing about the text is the portrayal of women. As a class, we read a feminist critique of the novel, which really indicts the novel (and thus Fitzgerald) as a negative reaction to the ""New Woman"" of the 1920s. So, no, there are no female role models of any sort in this text. Right here on Goodreads, I saw a poll of some sort that asked people to vote for which guy they'd go for in this novel if they were Daisy -- Gatsby or Tom. This seemed a sort of confirmation that there is shallowness to this novel when it comes to women. "
120,Amy Lou,"I HAD to read this for high school and college English classes, and like it okay, but you know? I highly recommend going back and trying it again once you've been out in the world for a while. I picked this up again in my 40's, read it over one weekend, and was absolutely stunned. It wasn't a bit like what I remembered, and it was a million times better. A beautiful, bitter pill of a book. "
121,Renee,"The Great Gatsby: Book 1953a.	I read this book a few days before I watched the movie in September. After I read the book, I understood the writer’s simple ‘main idea’, Gatsby’s love for Daisy, to write a complex novel. The writer, Scott Fitzgerald’s main idea, or his ‘golden line’ occurs when you realize that Gatsby’s is still head over heels in love with Daisy after so many years. The writer wrote an entire book around the simplistic idea of eternal and remarkable love.b.	Mr. F. Scott Fitzgerald did an incredible job of conveying his main idea, or the golden line. He strings the reader along in a tale of characters swimming in wealth and living with zero satisfaction; similar to a spoiled child who wants a new toy even though he owns hundreds. All along the ‘golden line or main attraction’ is Gatsby’s passion for love and the story of a man who never gave up on his dream of his love, Daisy. c.	I have no writing suggestions for F. Scott Fitzgerald and I believe he could teach me a thing or two about writing. d.	This is a mentor text. In fact, I believe many high school students have to read The Great Gatsby as a required text. I would use the passage from The Great Gatsby to teach my students how to write about the ‘golden line.” Or to ask my students to look for the sentence in a book that suddenly hits you and you understand the author’s purpose is. The passage: “There are all kinds of love in this world but never the same love twice.” This was the first time I read this book and I enjoyed every minute of it! Great read! "
122,Moses Kilolo,"Questions come to mind after reading this book. Just the basic questions in life. What's this we are chasing? What is friendship, really? And why would the same crowd that swarmed into my party not want to - be involved - when it's time to be laid down on the grave. Beautiful book people. Beautiful. Find it. Read it. American or not it's going to touch you."
123,Dylan,Youtube Review: http://youtu.be/WBXJAk0Fz0k
124,Mariam,"The first question to come to my mind when any of my friends finish a book, is ""how was it?"" to The Great Gatsby, I'd say, it was amazing, accurate, and enchanting. I always wondered what kind of man Gatsby was, prior to reading this book. Now, I'm sort of amazed by this man. For he is really a great man, built himself and strove for a future based on a single dream. Some might call him single-minded or foolish for obsessing over his past, and the need for it to be replayed but for me, Jay Gatsby was a man who gained my admiration. Call me foolish, I don't care, I liked him and I am sorry this book had to end, but it is one of its enchanting points is that it's shortness in length. "
125,Niklas,"At first I wasn't really sure what to make of Gatsby. On the one hand there was this beautiful writing with all those iconic metaphores and memorable quotes, but on the other hand I had trouble making sense of the plot? I mean I knew that Gatsby is a book which leaves the reader a lot of space for interpretation and it's one of those American classics you always see people read and analyse in English class in American TV shows and movies, but after reading the last chapter I felt a bit lost? But then I discovered John Green's highly interesting and entertaining literature crash courses on Gatsby which brought some light into the darkness and convinced me to give the book a five-star rating."
126,Natalie Hotz,"OMG! I loved this book! I wanted to read it before the movie came out. I'm so glad I did! The movie does not look like it will be similar to the book. I fear the movie will be a great disappointment to the original fantastic story line. (This review contains spoilers)The characters are all kind if involved in their own separate but semi-connected love triangles. No one is as faithful as they seem. Throughout the book you spend a lot of time thinking that Gatsby is kind of sinister. Gatsby is known around his block for throwing fantastic parties. Everyone in the book seems to think he has done a great many things to gain his wealth. Some say he's killed a man and stuff like that. Even though they all gossip about him, they all seem to jealous of him as well. Towards the end of the book you kind of realize that maybe he's not as bad as he seems. At the end of the book Gatsby is killed and the narrator nick who was one of the men that was jealous now saw that Gatsby really didn't have as much as he flaunted. He held a high name but as it turns out it really wasn't even his name and he really wasn't all he held himself up to be. All he really wanted was daisy (part of a love triangle) and he never truly got her either. In the end he was kind of a fake but he sure fooled a lot of people. I would definitely recommend this book to my friends! It is one of my favorites now. And I hope all of them appreciate it as much as I did. Very well written book. :)"
127,Emanuel,"Quando terminei a leitura da história do Gatsby há 13 dias fiquei imediatamente preso pela tragédia óbvia do romance de Fitzgerald. Com medo de estar toldado face ao que é ordinário e não (supostamente) relevante na obra fiquei-me pelas quatro estrelas, afinal, o romance não foi o que levou esta obra a ter o reconhecimento que lhe é atribuído actualmente, no imediato o fascínio veio por ele. Se por um lado alguém em tempos criou um Romeu e uma Julieta, que pela impossibilidade de um futuro decidem unir-se no presente criando uma possibilidade contra todas as expectativas, em Gatsby vi o Homem que acredita na possibilidade do futuro pela restauração de um passado impossível.Até hoje o pensamento foi-se aprofundando sobre a sociedade da década de vinte, sobre a falta de detalhe que a obra dá acerca dela e simultaneamente a profunda visão e consequências do sonho americano. Gatsby conquistou o sonho, ou pelo menos, um dos seus afluentes, o monetário. Não adquiriu exurbitância económica pela via do suor e da moral, a sua aquisição acaba por empenhar todas as suas outras pretensões de plenitude. Se aquele amor o levou a lutar pelo dito sonho como um meio de restruturação, é este último que também condena o homem que não consegui definir apesar de tudo como imoral, a uma cruel realidade.O sonho pode ser concretizável, fácil em algumas das suas faces, pode ser tudo o que resta. A impossibilidade da sua plenitude, vincada em Daisy e Tom, é um facto pelo qual qualquer um daqueles que sonharam não imaginaram ter que pagar com a própria vida. No final resta uma luz, verde, uma luz nos tenta numa escuridão bem mais real. Há luzes escuras."
128,Bridget Rose,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is the best book, I have read to date. Fitzgerald carries you inside his newly entranced world, as the point in time when he wrote the book he was already well-known and he and his wife, Zelda, became socialites. Nick Carraway (the narrator) is new in town and he goes to visit his cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom Buchanan, who he happens to know from college. After visiting them Tom, the next day, carries Nick to see his mistress and a hold bunch of immoral events happened throughout the plot of this novel. However, the light of the book is shone on Jay Gatsby, also known as Jimmy Gatz. Jimmy Gatz I concurred was his birth name. The book takes you on a journey of the rich and famous and the chase of the American Dream. However, the twist in this novel provides is that if Jay Gatsby could've had and married Daisy everything else would've proven irrelevant to him. Gatsby chases his dream no matter the cost.Both literally and figuratively. He did somethings that sure were illegal and unjust but he did it all in the name of love. Everything he did was to impress Daisy and when he got her he did everything in his power to protect her, even though she chose to run off and abandon Gatsby in his time of need. Not to mention it was her fault that he was facing the challenges he had. In the end he died but it was due to the fact that he was to wise for his own good. As he knew that having everything without the person you love is actually having nothing at all."
129,Saburi,"Relentless chase and absence. Absence is what drove the book for me. Every page that I turned was smeared with absence. Absence of love, absence ofthe past Gatsby chases, the fading glitterati. Everything stinking with the idea of missing pieces, the idea of longing, the idea of chasing. It drove me crazy to feel so much of ridiculous paparazzi at a point of time. But Gatsby was worth the while. I did not fall in love with the idea of Gatsby, but exactly what Gatsby was, what he signified, a man chasing his past, chasing a lost dream, making amends and then Nothing. Nothing Remains.Fitzgerald takes you to the tallest skyscraper in New York and pushes you with a nudge down in the gutter. Absence is all there was and ever will be. Something always missing in the life that was, that could be, that should have been. Lie will outlive the truth and you will witness the slow death of honour, susceptibility and you would murder your own perception of everything to be able to breathe in this world full of lies. Read it over and over again. For it would be difficult to meet another Gatsby, in this life."
130,Rachel Barrocas,"The Great Gatsby takes place in 1925. It’s narrated by Nick Carraway, a war veteran. In the beginning of the book, he moves into West Egg next to Jay Gatsby, a rich man who throws extravagant parties every Saturday night. Nobody really knows how Gatsby makes all of his money. Nick gets intertwined in Gatsby's life, including his love life with Daisy Buchanan, who is married to Tom, Nick’s friend. Tom is also involved in an affair with the town mechanic’s wife. There are a lot of tragic twists and turns resulting from these affairs. I really enjoyed this book. It’s known as a classic that everyone should read, and my opinion coincides with that. I definitely would recommend this to my classmates. Even though the writing is a bit hard to get through since is was written so long ago, it’s an interesting story so it makes up for that. The characters are flawed but interesting nonetheless. There were some major surprises in the plot that I definitely wasn’t expecting. The book is on the shorter side, just under 200 pages; some people might like that and some people might not. I will be reading this book again and again. "
131,Carlos,"“The Great Gatsby” is incontrovertibly one of the great American novels. I read this novel for the first time during my freshman year in high school, and I cannot say that I enjoyed it. The plot seemed mundane and I had a difficult time relating to the characters. I could not decipher the meaning behind the detail so I ultimately found the book uninteresting. Reading the book wasn’t a class assignment; I read it out of personal curiosity. It was not until recently that I gave the book another chance. Why was “The Great Gatsby” such a big deal to so many people? Why was it held in such high regard? I had to understand what others understood. A couple of months ago I decided to buy the old-fashioned cliff notes for the novel. For one week I sat down every night and read a chapter or two of “The Great Gatsby”. Each chapter was so vivid in description and dialogue, and I immediately felt contempt for the superficial Buchanans. The writer is graceful in his absence of elaboration in some situations during interaction between characters. With the story set right before the great depression, the majority of the characters are of wealthy families soaking up the economic prosperity of the jazz age. Nick Carraway, our narrator, is of more modest financial status than the rest. His perspective allows the reader to have an open mind about the material world that the people surrounding him live in. The story flows from beginning to end seamlessly, and really gets you to empathize with Gatsby. His goal to win Daisy Buchanan is what ultimately drives his friendship with Nick; leaving Nick acknowledging the fact that Gatsby was essentially a better person than the rest of them because of his determination away from money. After that week of reading “The Great Gatsby” I understood why it was a classic, and why I had not enjoyed it the first time. I was simply not ready to comprehend a novel so abundant in symbolic resonance. The green light at the end of the bay or the eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg meant little to me initially. However, my second read really opened my eyes to the genius of this book. It is a cultural achievement. It is a criticism of greed. It is an entertaining story above all, even without the immense scrutiny of each chapter. “The Great Gatsby” is a superb novel, and ranks high on my favorites. It’s a book that shouldn’t be forced to be read in high school English class, but implored to be read."
132,Cherith,I want to roll around and cuddle with the prose in this novel. It's so gorgeous and I think equals or surpasses any author's. The plot is fascinating and so is the narrator; the characters aren't too loveable or even relatable but dang that prose. I'm so glad I re-read it with Ferg and finished right before we watched the film :)
133,Kennis,"I read this book in high school and remember enjoying it. I just reread it recently in preparation for Baz Luhrmann's upcoming film adaptation of the novel. I have to say, I liked it this time even more than I initially did. Gatsby stands atop one of the best American novels written for good reason, in my opinion. While it is a novel truly of Fitzgerald's time and place, it transcends generations ahead and echoes into today's contemporary life. Gatsby is a timeless character who's aspirations and ideals reverberate as my own - to come from nothing and gain wealth, status, power, and love through cunning and hard work. He's the spitting image of the self-made man fulfilling manifest destiny - the American dream. Amongst the orgastic revelry and exaltation, however, is it just that, a dream? A fantasy? Gatsby attains all of his goals but one - the true love that he let slip through his fingers. That's where we, through Nick Carraway, enter into the story. We observe as Gatsby uses his power and influence to try and recapture his past, his Daisy. But as time passes and changes, so do we all. In love, can we regain that which we have lost? Can anything ever be as it once was? When Gatsby reveals his motives about Daisy to Nick, Nick tells him that he can't repeat the past. Gatsby incredulously retorts: “Can’t repeat the past?…Why of course you can!” As the novel comes to it's tragic end (Spoiler? You must have seen it coming!), you come to the same harsh realization that Gatsby must have come to - that Nick was right."
134,Ali,"*SPOILER ALERT*This book was amazing. I loved this book because it is suspenseful, romantic, and overall a great story. So many unexpected events happen, and Fitzgerald keeps you reading. The beginning was very hard to get into for me. It seemed as if it was going slow. After a few chapters, though, it was very hard to stop reading. As it is very hard to pick what part of this story is my favorite, I liked it best at Gatsbys parties. There are so many different personalities and events at his parties and it is interesting to hear about what goes on at them. My favorite character overall had to be Jay Gatsby himself! He is so mysterious, and romantic. He is determined to rekindle his old love with Daisy. He acts as though he will die without her. He is a very entertaining man, and has a very interesting past. When he died, it made me so sad! Why could he not have just lived? I wish he would have lived. Who was really driving the car when Gatsby and Daisy hit Mrs. Wilson? Was Gatsby lying when he told Tom who was driving? "
135,Maxwell,3rd time's a charm. It gets better every time I read it.
136,Kenneth Hanson,"I had a series of expectations upon the begetting of this wonderful novel in my English class. First, with this prodigious novel acquired the title, ""one of the most important books of all time,"" I expected that it would deliver on all the series of appeasement that a novel would plausibly satisfy. If there were any other mere words to describe this remarkable novel that delivers on all the expectations for any polymath, it is that this novel abstained from remaining insipid, but with the use of ""literary eclat,"" by the benevolent, esteemed, venerable F. Scott Fitzgerald - referring to the use of prodigious arrangement - the author was able to satisfy the elusive, insuperable series of expectations each reader has: vacuous or erudite. With the scrupulous individuals who read this novel, I am proud to say this novel was extremely remarkable and was seemingly perfect. Set in the radical 1920s, an aspiring bondsman rents a home in Long Island's West Egg, a community copious with garish, opulent, ostentatious nascent patricians. Nick Carraway (the narrator), in particular, begins to identify Jay Gatsby as a prime precedent of a person's drive for opulence simply just to appease their desires, in Jay Gatsby's particular case, for Daisy, a girl he once met before, avouching an aspiring relationship, but with the penurious status of Jay Gatsby, she was forced to consummate a relationship with Tom Buchanan, an outrageously wealthy individual. After Jay Gatsby's extraordinary bootlegging efforts with Meyer Wolfsheim leads him to wealth, he (Gatsby) finds himself in a Gothic house in the West Egg (fictitious) area of Long Island, where he consistently hosts parties in an effort to appease Daisy: the love of his life. Unfortunately, Jay Gatsby finds himself in a tremulously destined failure, and through the course of the summer, he was able to expiate a relationship with Daisy - once again. Tom, while carrying an extramarital affair with Myrtle Wilson, begins to speculate the affair between Jay Gatsby and Daisy; in the most formidable culmination of the story (the death of Myrtle by Daisy in Jay Gatsby's yellow automobile) and through the relevance of this truth to Mr. Wilson by Tom, Jay Gatsby is then before the perilous menacing of his (or so he claims) actions. Essentially, I absolutely recommend that you read this novel. "
137,Ale,"In English class, at school, our teacher always said that when one talks about the Great American Novel, The Great Gatsby is probably one of the first to come to mind. I remember scoffing at that, because I was 18, young and dumb, and I hadn't read the novel anyway, so why did I care about that? Now, 7 years on, I look back on those days and I can only be thankful to my younger self for not picking this book up, reading 20 pages and promptly deciding it's trash. The Great Gatsby may be a lot of things, but it is certainly not trash. At once decadent and condemning, satirical and serious, the novel follows Nick Carraway and the summer he spends in West Egg, Long Island, New York, his acquaintance with Jay Gatsby, and the subsequent events. It is a deconstruction of the American Dream and its values, particularly the idea of the self-made man, but it also reads as a love letter to times past (strangely enough, although Fitzgerald wrote this in 1925, before the Great Depression, there are some serious moments of foreshadowing), that we try to hold on to, but can never truly find again. The obsession with the past, the glorious, wonderful past, is something Fitzgerald spends time on in the novel, including Gatsby uttering the famous line: ""Can't repeat the past? [...] Why of course you can!"", an ultimately tragic dream. Like in his The Beautiful and Damned, Fitzgerald doesn't really create sympathetic characters. The only one remotely okay is Nick (to me, an extension of Fitzgerald himself), but everyone else is tragic and doomed right from the start. Daisy and Tom, in their money and carelessness, believe themselves above the mere requirements of ordinary people. Tom carries his affairs on in a casual, uncaring fashion, while Daisy spends her days unaware of what to do with herself. I never believed that she didn't know, and when she and Gatsby embark on their own affair, I think she does it partly to spite Tom and partly because she knows, deep inside, that nothing can come of it. She is swept away by the possibility of running away with Gatsby, but not because she loves him; she loves the idea of him, faithful to her for so long in ways her husband couldn't be, and doesn't want to be, she loves the fame he has and the aura of mystery about him. She is a beautiful, golden fool, the same as she describes her daughter, because at one in this position she is almost safe from harm. When tragedy strikes, Gatsby takes the fall for her (almost naturally), and the scene between her and Tom speaks volumes: she will forgive him, they will forget Gatsby and what happened, and they will move on, because their money can buy them anything and after all, what more could she want?And yet I felt for Gatsby the most, not because of his ""greatness"" or because of his ingenuity and charm. I felt for him because I have been Gatsby once too, I have been Gatsby watching the light at the end of a pier, and hoping I could stretch out far enough and open my arms wide enough to hold on to the past. I wanted him to succeed so badly, but at the same time I was aware that it couldn't happen, that he and Daisy no longer had a future. A man with so much to offer, and so much hope that he ultimately cannot see himself in any other situation but with Daisy, going back into the past and remaking it to his liking. I could identify with that, but I also like to think that unlike Gatsby, I am able to separate what was and what could have been from what is. And that I can move on from the green light at the end of the pier, accepting fate and moving on. "
138,Gabriel Martins,"""Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men."" livro é narrado pela personagem Nick Carraway, um jovem veterano da 1º Guerra Mundial que se muda para West Egg, Long Island.

139,Gary S.,"To add to the ever growing lists of those who enjoy Gatsby, I must admit, I did not realize that many students enjoyed this novel. One of the major english class themes I seem to pick up on is the complaint is how many of the characters are unrelatable (funny thing about this word, unrelatable, most word processors do not seem to be able to detect that it is a valid word). However, in a way, these characters are not meant to be relatable, you are immersed into the world not as putting yourself in a characters shoes in this novel (and I suspect that the characters do not enjoy you putting your smelly feet in their nice shoes) but as the third wheel. You are supposed to be like the man beside Nick, who watches and ultimately does nothing. As for those who do not know ""The American Dream"" it is supposed to be the philosophy of America, where anybody and any person can rise up to high status from whichever status they started from. Gatsby is the embodiment because he is the self-made man. Even though he obtained his money illegally, bootlegging alcohol to be perfectly clear, who did in this novel? Tom and Daisy (maybe Nick, there are so many variations on this novel which imply so many things I suspect many of you could solve your problems by picking another edition) have all been old money holders, and even then, the old money comes from a man who paid off another man to die for him during the civil war so he could build his business. Is that moral? No, of course not, unless you consider it perfectly within the rights of the rich to pay off the poor to die for them, in which case I suggest you go take a long walk, take a couple of gardening classes or go to your local greenhouse and ask for or grow a conscience. I hear those are wonderful plants to have, wonderful for the social life as well. But the formatting of this paragraph must be getting on your nerves, so let us get to the true meat of this review. Buckle up, because if you are still here, then your stuck (unless you decide the opportunity cost of reading this review is too much, then just bugger off now) for the long haul.Now, this is better right? The Great Gatsby is not a brilliant novel I will say. In no way does it deserve the title of best novel in the galaxy (that belongs to the Hitchhiker's Guide, with over a hundred thousand reviews of bad poetry from Volgons, Dolphins, Aldebarans, etc...) but it is a novel of significant achievement. Not many books can pull of this style of writing, this fine line of impersonal and personal, but this book can. A major asset to reading this book would be the inclination to do research, because the theme of the novel fit's the 1920's so well, when there was no alcohol to go around, yet we couldn't stop getting drunk to see the golden luster fade before our eyes. Though I guess not everyone on this site can be expected to be a history buff. The problem with this novel really is that (at least in the first few editions, the later ones get VERY distorted, like the awkward Telephone ""icebreaker"" game with a couple hundred thousand people) the characters are built too much like people. You can hate no one if you look deeply enough and like no one for the same reason. ""But Tom is an utter asshat!"" you might say. You would be fully correct in that statement, but it is still clear that he cares for Daisy, though for the entirety of the novel Daisy's daughter kind of acts like a weed as a ""wait, Daisy has a daughter? Isn't she mentioned only once?""and you have to wonder if Tom and Daisy even take care of her, but taking care of little girls isn't interesting (unless you have daughters, in which case hearing strangers daughters being taken care of is as interesting as Volgon poetry). But I digress. In short, read it, and if you don't like it, spin up the roulette table and pick another edition. I mean of the 4 books subtitled in advertising The Great American Novel at least Gatsby is more modern than Huckleberry Finn while also not being a bloody whaling guide like Moby Dick or an very awkward and kind of dull swan song like Gone with the Wind. Actually, now that think about it, Gone with the Wind is like the very long note at the end of an opera except off key and the tang of ""a 'bit' sexist and racist"" with a background noise of what I imagine Davy Jones from Pirates of the Carribean would sound like if his tentacles were what he spoke with while being run through with a forest turned into chopsticks and a buzzsaw."" "
140,Gabriela,"I'll keep this short and sweet. When I say I appreciated this novel in full, I did and I do. The Great Gatsby, for me, is the kind of book you want to hear no one else's opinions so yours aren't tainted. It's also the kind of book you should not read in one sitting. Unless you're, in my opinion, superhuman and have the ability to connect the dots automatically as you read page by page without the necessity of a step-back. This is a skill I'm unsure I'll ever master, but I'm practicing. Also, do yourself the favor of reading the book first before watching any of the film adaptions. If you want a laugh out of special effects, watch the 1926/1949 adaptions. If you want a headache, watch the adaption from 1974. Mia Farrow's voice has you covered. And if you want to share some well-worth tears, watch the 2013 adaption. In this case, the special effects won't make you cry but rather bewilder you.This is a book full of morally rotten, shallow people and it gets 5 stars because I wholeheartedly love the Fitzgerald's, I am easily pleased, and The Great Gatsby checked all of those boxes. "
141,Isabella Skovira,Snow day spent with Gatsby. Always so good to re-read.
142,Jules,Even better than expected!
143,Harry Whitewolf,"I'm sure a lot of us feel bad that we haven't yet read particular classic books. I haven't read Dickens. Or Slaughterhouse 5. But it's with Fitzgerald with whom I feel most ashamed in not getting around to reading until now; at the age of thirty eight. Because I kind of knew I'd love his work, being a lynch pin of American writing styles; a forerunner to the beats and beyond. And I was absolutely right- his prose is as fresh and lyrical and voracious as anything that's come since.  It's easy to overlook the fact that The Great Gatsby was written nearly ninety years ago, because apart from the post-war politics and social expectations, it could as easily be set today- or much any other time. To me, this book is chiefly about illusions and perspectives. It's the Tim Burton's Big Fish story. Who is Gatsby? The notorious, party giving, rich, socialite of whom little is known about. Are the stories he tells about himself true? Gossip surrounds him. Everyone's got a different take on Gatsby. In some respects, it reminded me of Oscar Wilde, with themes of rich people's position within polite society and their attempts to alleviate boredom and purposelessness. But the more I got suckered into this story, the more it became about perspectives. All we think we know is stories. And by the last chapter or two, everything comes together to show us how one perspective alone can have dire consequences, even though that perspective's understood. Gatsby is perfectly told through Nick's eyes, as he is the one who we get to know most, even if only through his sympathetic judgement of Gatsby and his friends. But I don't mean to get too philosophical. More than anything, this is simply a damn good short read from start to finish, with jazz beauty poetic words such as: “So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star.”  There's much to find within this what could also be simple tale. It feels like the prose version of Citizen Kane. It's for the reader to find what they want themselves, in the pages of The Great Gatsby. Great, Fitzgerald.Harry Whitewolf. (Author of Route Number 11: Argentina, Angels & Alcohol.)"
144,Juanbpf,"I don't know what I liked so much from this book, but I loved it. I enjoyed every page I read as I could analyze the character's personalites based on little description and lots of interaction within the story. I never thought this book could get to be one of the best books I have ever read. "
145,Serina,"*4.7The style at first was really confusing, but once I got used to it, I began to enjoy it, a lot. Fitzgerald conveys both romantic and intense moments perfectly; his sensory details are thorough yet not jaded. The symbolism, I think, is one of the most well done ones. It's so hard to describe it - the language is just so, so beautiful!""No--Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.""""For a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.""The theme is very insightful and gave me a lot to think about after finishing the book. The Great Gatsby is now one of my favorite classics, perhaps it's even above The Scarlet Letter. I will definitely reread this.(view spoiler)[It's really sad, as in pathetic, that Daisy and Tom leave. Especially Daisy, who has sworn that she loves Gatsby, yet lets him to cover up for the accident. It's amazing the extent people are willing to go for love. (hide spoiler)]"
146,Hanna M.," ""The Great Gatsby"" by ""F.Scott Fitzgerald"" is a story of true love. This story is about a man who has a huge house, the biggest parties, and really anything he wants at his finger tips, except the only thing he really wants, his love Daisy. The main character, Nick is telling the story of his cousin Daisy. She is married. However she is forced to test the strength of her marriage when her long lost love Jay Gatsby and her meet over tea after five years. Gatsby and Daisy are still in love but with Tom, Daisy's husband, in the way Gatsby does anything to make Daisy choose him over Tom. The hardest part for Gatsby is that he can't get daisy to make up her mind about the whole thing. Fitzgerald describes his feelings as  “The loneliest moment in someone’s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.” -F. Scott Fitzgerald This story will get into your heart one page at a time. Read this classic romance to see what Gatsby will do for Daisy. So will daisy choose Gatsby, or will she slip away from him again?"
147,Michelle Melton,"The Great Gatsby, is a very mellow dramatic novel. Who is Gatsby? Neighbor? Friend? Does anyone truly know the man who lives next door? Does anyone know? Rumors are he is a Russian spy.It might just be me, but I loved this book.(yes, yes, this ending is horrible.. but do you not see, why it is so important?) I'm not going to get into details but it is a truly wonderful novel. I love drama that leaves you questioning everything you do, because it gives you a perspective that you will never fully experience. What if? I surely do believe their is people out there that are like 'daisy' which makes this book more realistic. And Gatsby, poor young gent, was a rather strange fellow, to most but not to Nick, getting close to Gatsby truly changed his life, and made him understanding things. Things that people wouldn't fully understand unless they knew the real Gatsby. (Nick's purspective is who the story is told by.) I could go on but I truly believe all should read.If your not a fan of old settings, drama based, this is not your book. But remember, it was based in 1922 and published in 1925."
148,Emadeddin,"""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past""Oh Gatsby! You old sport!You're better than them. Those careless people. This novel is one of the greatest novels I've ever read. It's so deep. It hurts. At the end I figured out that we're all Gatsby. We're all seeking that green light, and looking forward to achieve our impossible future dreams. I'm glad I read it. And I highly recommend it. It's a must read."
149,Tammy Ferebee,"One of the only books I wasn't forced to read in High School. I actually wanted to read this and I still revisit it. Definitely a classic! Exposes early twentieth century hypocrisy. Loved the story line, great characterization, and prose. A fantastic read! "
150,Kelsey,"This book is so wonderfully written. Fitzgerald is an excellent writer who captured the essence of the '20s perfectly. With the 1920s being one of my favorite time periods, it was enlightening to see what life was like during this time in history. I definitely would like to read more from Fitzgerald. This is book is set in 1925, and Nick, who is from the west, moves to NY and finds a job as a stock broker. His cousin, Daisy, and her husband Tom, whom Nick went to college with, live across from him. They are extremely wealthy, along with his other neighbor, Jay Gatsby, who throws extravagant parties frequently. The premise is essentially that Daisy and Gatsby had a relationship five years earlier and Gatsby has not given up. He still longs for a relationship with Daisy to make his life completely perfect. This is story is beautifully told, and Fitzgerald hints a lot of interesting critiques on society and how the actions of few can change that group's life, and how people may change their whole identity just to be accepted into a society or lifestyle they wish to be a part of. On the surface, it seems to be an average love story, but it is so, so, so deeper than that."
151,Farah  Ispahany,"Like all classics The Great Gatsby offers readers from any generation and background something (or someone) they can relate to. For all its insightful commentary on the failings and hopes of the American Dream, I think at its core The Great Gatsby is a story of belonging. Fitzgerald so brilliantly weaves the tale of a man who goes to great lengths to achieve this through his pursuit of the women he loves. Gatsby himself as a character is so utterly heartbreaking, I always find myself wanting to shake some sense into him, yet at the same time completely understanding the motivations behind his actions. I think at some point everyone feels like a Gatsby, Daisy, Nick and that is what makes this story so riveting. However more than an intriguing plot, The Great Gatsby is a beautifully written piece of literature that so perfectly encapsulates its time period. Fitzgerald never has to overwrite or go on for pages with description, not because he can't, but because he simply doesn't need to. One of the (if not the) greatest books I've ever read and will continue to go back to again and again. "
152,Stephanie Marie,"2013 update: Just re-read for the third time (like everyone and their grandma) in order to properly embrace the new Baz Luhrmann remake. This book is just... heavenly. It is perfection. Fitzgerald just has a way with words that makes you want to read, and re-read, and go back and re-read again a single line. There is so much underlined, so many words that are animated in new and exciting ways... Fitzgerald did something great here.The characters are really what make this story memorable. Yes, the actual plot is captivating, but the characters infuse it with that beloved quality. Everyone is a fraud; everyone, even the overly moral Nick, is to be questioned. The overarching theme-- that we can be whomever we want to be, for however long we can keep up the ruse-- is such an American sensibility, infused in our mindset. This time around, I nearly despised everyone... except Gatsby, of course. His unflappable hope and commitment. This is one of those books that must be returned to, time and time again."
153,LawStudent Reader,"This has been one of my favorite works since I read it back in high school. Reading it again six or seven years later did not change my opinion. The story is glamorous, giving an insight into the lives of the extraordinarily wealthy. But at the same time it is tragic, almost hinting at the fact that piles of money cannot make one truly happy. The love that Gatsby has for Daisy is the motivation for his wealth, but it makes me sad that money overpowers love in their world. What Fitzgerald has is a beautiful, tragic story of a deep love that can never fully come to fruition because of vanity. I truly love this book and probably will still if I revisit it again later."
154,Beck,Nick attends Gatsby’s funeral along with Jay’s father and Owl eyes. The other guests that attend Jay’s party’s are only there for the liquor and the fun. Nick is Gatsby’s only true friend because he is angry with Tom for getting Gatsby killed and because he is sad that Gatsby is dead.I associate Owl eyes with Dr. T. J. Eckleburg because they both wear thick glasses and because owl eyes is given no official name and i associate Dr. T. J. Eckleburg with god because wilson sals “god is always watching” when looking at the billboard of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg. In conclusion Nick represents the facade of Gatsby Mr. Gatz represents the past and owl eyes represents the real Gatsby
155,DANIEL,"Re-read Gatsby and wow, so incredible. I have not touched it since college, but was drawn to it thinking recently about class and conceptual ideas of America and Democracy as a grand experiment. The novel bursts with insight and poetry. I look forward to revisiting it again and again in the future. ""I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors' eyes--a fresh, great breast of the new world ... for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent ... face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder."""
156,Anirban Nanda,"All I can say about this book is that, this is an extremely jazzy, filled with sublime prose and atmosphere and certainly is a masterpiece. A beauty. Sharing few excerpts:
The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall red haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly that everything was very very sad—she was not only singing, she was weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep.
See?Or,
… One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalk really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees—he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder. His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.
One word: WOW!"
157,Helen,"I am almost loathed to write a review for this book as I simply cannot think of any words, in any combination, that I could use to do it justice. Everything about it is mesmerising, intoxicating. The language astounds me so consistently I practically read it with my mouth hanging open. Each element of it; a love story, a tragedy, denial, deception, hope, the masked reality of an era of indulgence, comes together to create a world on the surface of which is gold and glittering but underneath, the soul of which is doomed. I'm always left with such a sense of sadness at the end it's all I can do to stare forlornly at the back cover for a few minutes before it goes back on the shelf. The Great Gatsby is just that.....great, special and unforgettable."
158,Мира,"Sadly, most of the readers dont accumulate the lessons and messages given in this book. I prefer to see it as the representation of the constant fight the human spirit is having with the disappointments in life - some of which may be our biggest dreams and goals, the ones we have been chasing our entire life, and even when we realize them - we keep on going forwards ,because that's the only thing we've actually really wanted and looked forward to. "
159,Jemi,"Before I read this book, I took it upon myself to peruse through reviews made by my friends on Goodreads and other members, who all had ambivalent feelings towards the novel which led me to see for myself what the book was really like. I managed to finish The Great Gatsby in one sitting - I was so enthralled.Fitzgerald's writing is so fluid and natural that it can be read with ease, and as the story develops, more twists and turns are introduced and the book becomes a page-turner you are incapable of closing shut. The characters were fascinating, diverse and individualistic - and that's how it should be.There isn't much more I can say about the book for I fear I may spoil it for some readers, so I implore you to read this for yourself and unearth a potential favourite for many years to come; it is no wonder that The Great Gatsby is a literary classic."
160,Selena Defraises,"When I finished reading this book I totally understood why this became a classic. The story telling was beautiful using so many adjectives and the descriptions were both ""dreamy"" and realistic at the same time. The narrator, Nick Carraway, was a ""passepartout"" character. He was the glue that made this story keep going and I really liked him. As for the Great Gatsby, we really are talking about a Great character. With this veil of mystery wrapped tightly around him, Jay Gatsby remained an enigmatic figure for the most part of the story. Yet we can still decipher the type of person he was through the little details about him and the way he talked to all of his guests, even the ones he hated. As we knew more about his past, that glamorous mystery around him started to slowly fade away and his true self was coming out in the surface. The American dream, Gatsby's dream and most people's dream. Jay Gatsby managed to make it come true, yet he still was not happy. Not because he got greedy and he wanted more but mainly because this was not the way he had dreamed of it. Despite his glamorous life Jay Gatsby remained a pretty realistic character. All he ever wanted was to -kind of- lose his identity and become the person he had always dreamed of being.A story that teaches you a lot about the cost of your dreams. A cost that you may not quite comprehend when you're 17, but when you achieve greatness you have to accept the consequences. Rating 5/5"
161,Brinyy Summer,"When I first read this book at a young age I found it to be so magical and mysterious. Everything about it made me wonder, for I had not yet experienced tragedies concerning love or loss in any way just yet. After reading it a week ago (many years later) I find it to be so realistic and also very ridiculous in the best of ways. Fitzgerald's endless rants about the beauty and the tragedy of each moment makes me want to rush through the pages to see what else he can describe so eloquently and also slow down and read each page again and again till I memorize it. If you haven't read this book in some time, and even if you just want to read it because the modern film is coming out...DO IT! "
162,Maya Young,"In West Egg, there is one man who every Saturday has the most extravagant parties for no particular reason. Everyone goes. Everyone has an amazing time, but no one has ever seen or met the man who throws these parties. Nick Carraway recently moved to a town in Long Island known as “West Egg.” His neighbor is a mysterious man that he only knows to be a shadow. Jordan Baker, a friend of Nick’s cousin (Daisy), tells Carraway about this mysterious man and all the parties that he has. One day, Nick gets a personal invitation from his neighbor named Jay Gatsby. Nick and Gatsby develop a friendship and Nick soon becomes Gatsby’s confidant. Later in the book, you find that Gatsby is not the happy man that you think. You find that he has many secrets and lies about his past. I enjoyed this book very much. The mystery draws you in, wanting you to read more to learn about the lies and secrets that Gatsby has been keeping from everyone. Having the story be set in the 20s was a fantastic choice made by Fitzgerald. Having the book set at this time, lets you imagine things easier and helps with the way that you view the towns and events. I enjoyed this book a lot and I think that everyone should read it. There are a few lessons in the book that I think anyone could relate to. "
163,Bobby,"What a great book. I actually read the whole thing, so obviously that means I liked it. Nice and succinct."
164,Helia,"5 stars""can't repeat the past?... Why of course you can!""The Great Gatsby shows humanity to be shallow, obsessed with the image of themselves and others so much so that they create an illusion of perfection for themselves. Jay Gatsby's illusion comes in the form of Daisy, his old love and now a married woman.Nick's honest and reliable narration highlights how people are careless with one another, but that not all people behave so. Although Gatsby is not the most realistic of characters, Fitzgerald creates a contradiction within his character. Of all the aspects of himself Gatsby altered in order to move forward from the past, the one thing he cannot let go of is Daisy. His mind revolves around Daisy so much that both his sense of reality and sense of self is lost as no one knows who he is, not even himself.Fitzgerald uses his novel to show that there is no such thing as a greater person, and that those given such a title are often provided it by strangers looking from a distance. It is only when one looks at the whole picture that it is clear that Gatsby is not ""great"", only a man deluded by his own fantasy."
165,Alhanouf AlWagdani,The Great Gatsby is my favorite classic of all time I'm so not over how this ended. So much hate for Daisy and Tom.
166,Thomas,"Never read it in high school and occasionally I get the notion to read a ""classic"" that I haven't read before. With the exception of ""Catcher In the Rye"" I have enjoyed every one.This is no exception though I wished we could have followed Nick around a little more, he was, as I think, the only character with a clue.However, if too many characters do have a clue then the story is not usually the better for it. This is the story of self-entitled people doing what they do best, be narcissistic.I am AMAZED at how relevant the story is for now and am surprised someone hasn't adapted it to a 21st century milieu.So many good lines in the book, my favorite, ""I'm five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor."""
167,Steph,"‘Gatsby? What Gatsby?’ This is such a seminal work of literature that it now no longer even needs its full title to capture the essence of the novella. A simple reference to ‘the man who gave this book its name’ is enough to spark a thousand images and that painful sense of tragic sorrow that so many of us feel when encountering Gatsby.In fact, it does not even need me to offer a synopsis as, apart from anything else, such an endeavour would spoil the brilliance of the book for those who have not yet encountered it. So why is it so wonderful? Why am I able to read it again and again and still find it so amazing, still find something new in it on each reading? Why does it divide opinion so strongly between those who adore Gatsby and those who see him as a deluded fraudster, between those who pity Daisy and those who, like Nick, condemn her as a ‘careless’, heartless harridan? In short, what is the brilliance of Gatsby?SPOILERS ALERT:(view spoiler)[1. Fitzgerald is a master story teller. He captures the reader from the outset with exactly the question that Daisy later asks ‘what Gatsby?’ and leaves us from Nick’s initial expostulation about his ‘younger and more vulnerable years’ with a sense of intrigue about this character who both induces ‘scorn’ in Nick and yet warrants the epithet ‘gorgeous.’ Even when we have finally met him, the mystery surrounding his past – did her really kill a man, where has his money come from, why is he connected to Wolfsheim, what favour does he want so desperately from Nick is subtly maintained. Then once this element of tension is over, there is the heart breaking build up to his meeting with Daisy and our desperate anxiety as to whether or not their love, if it even exists, can survive. For a novel in which, really, very little occurs, Fitzgerald has a means of gripping the reader, propelling us onwards and engaging us in each new mystery by delaying what Nick must already know in advance, superbly.2. Today we are perhaps used to the method of using an unreliable narrator – McEwan is a master of this in novels such as ‘Enduring Love’ and ‘Atonement’ and authors such as McGrath frequently use it (see my review on ‘Ghost Town.’) However, this was in many regards a new technique when Fitzgerald wrote ‘The Great Gatsby’ in a modernist form. Although Nick can sometimes be frustrating what is brilliant about this technique is that it enables the reader to make their own choices, to interpret the characters as they choose and this is perhaps why opinion is so divided about characters like Daisy. Is she the long suffering wife of Tom who was forced into marriage by social pressure when she really would have waited for Gatsby if she had had the choice. Is the abiding image we have of her the woman who clutches a sodden letter from the great love of her life in the bath the day before her wedding? Alternatively, is she merely a merciless, cold-hearted product of the 1920s society whose only concern lies with her social status and wealth? Is the final image we have of the woman who wants her daughter to be nothing but a ‘fool’, who ultimately chooses Tom for the life he can provide and abandons the man, even in death, who has not merely yearned for her from afar for five years, but saved her reputation in taking the blame for the fatal car accident? The very fact we are able to have such a debate lies at least in part in the unreliable narrative perspective that leaves open such interpretations and makes the novel so brilliant.3. Then of course there is the wonderful poetic quality of the writing. This is surely one of the few novels where even the most poignant symbols remain large in the reader’s mind and continue to resonate. Who can forget the looming eyes of ‘Dr Eckleberg’ the monstrous, carnivalesque yellow car belonging to Gatsby or the green light that shines like a beacon from Daisy’s dock and which Gatsby reaches out to ‘trembling’ from the opening chapter? These symbols, much like the image patterns that Shakespeare frequently uses as a means of interweaving themes and giving his plays cohesion (the garden imagery in ‘Richard II’ the images of blood in ‘Macbeth’, the imagery associated with the stars and fate in ‘Romeo and Juliet’) resonate with meaning in ‘Gatsby’. [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VhYMd...]4. What I also love is the way the book seems to capture the hedonistic, immoral spirit of 1920s society through its depiction of New York, Gatsby’s parties and ennui evidenced in Tom and Daisy. As much as this may be repellent, there is also something alluring and fascinating about it. Baz Luhrman is a fabulous director (‘Moulin Rouge’ is one of my favourite all time movies and to throw in my own appropriately romantic comment, my husband and I got engaged in Paris at the Moulin Rouge so it holds particularly dear memories for me). He has done a fantastic job with Gatsby and is incredibly faithful to the text (with perhaps the exception of the very opening). What his film does especially well though, particularly through music, is to convey that 1920s joie de vivre, carefree (and careless) spirit that Fitzgerald depicts in the novel. In a world of prohibition, the drinks flow freely, in a world of abject poverty epitomised by the Valley of Ashes, lavish spending is de rigour, in a world where the rich should stand as moral examples, they indulge in affairs and drink profusely, in a world where the American dream advocates hard work, money is really only made through crime. It offers an eye opening insight into the truth about this society that is really enlightening to an audience reading nearly a century after the fact. [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaBVLh...]5. Then, of course, there is Gatsby – the Tremalchio figure himself – the one who is worth more than the ‘rotten bunch’ – the individual whose tragic narrative consumes the reader. Like Daisy, he too divides opinion and if I was going to offer a literary analysis of his character, I would emphasise the ambiguity of his presentation and even consider the fact that he is merely in love with Daisy’s, whose voice is even ‘full of money,’ because she represents a gateway into the upper echelons of society that he has desired since he abandoned his rural roots and stepped onto Dan Cody’s boat. However, this is not a literary analysis, this is my opinion. And I just can’t help but fall in love with Gatsby. He does stand out, even in his isolation from the other hedonistic party goers and seems different from the criminal underworld from which he has been forced to earn his money. There is a wonderful ‘romantic readiness’ about him that makes your heart bleed: a sense that everything he has done: buying his mansion, improving himself, earning money, throwing parties, engineering that first desperate meeting, which encapsulates the hopes of five years, simply to win the love of his life. There is something so noble about Gatsby’s desire to be with Daisy – the only girl he has every truly loved- and so noble about his ultimate sacrifice for her, which is epitomised in Nick’s comment that ‘the holocaust is complete’ that absolutely reflects the enormity of what has been lost with Gatsby’s demise. Moreover, there is something so tragic in his loss at the end even in its anti-climactic nature. Even the funeral, which in its silence and insignificance so painfully juxtaposes the vibrant parties of earlier, is a tragic affair that barely does justice to the character we too have come to idolise. Thus, like Nick, I felt a profound sense of loss at the end of the novel, a sense that the dream was over, a sense that whilst we may ‘beat on’ there was really little point because a light had gone out when Gatsby died.(view spoiler)[ (hide spoiler)]There is something flawless about this novel, no word is wasted, no moment is superfluous, no character not resonate with meaning. It is thus perhaps not Gatsby himself who warrants the title ‘great’, but rather the novel itself and it is a novel that I will return to again and again and find new meaning in, new romance and perhaps even new hope.

168,Harleen,"Oh god. Such a beautiful story. Jay Gatsby, the character is just wonderful. He hides his emotions, his past, his lifestyle, everything really it changes for just one girl mainly. Once he meets this girl, his life revolves around and from a soldier, he becomes this wealthy personality. But with love, you have to face the troubles as well. The girl he loved was really just after money which is why he became the wealthiest man ever so she would leave his husband for him. He was ready to take on the world but that stupid bitch was a wreck and ended up crashing and killing his husbands mistress. Jay took the blame so no trouble would come on his lover and ends up dying. "
169,Gillian Oler,My favorite. 
170,Paulina Odeth,"Esta es realmente una historia que quieres leer lento e irla disfrutando. Es una novela en la cual no hace falta ver muchas escenas con cada personaje, porque el narrador es grande en hacer que los entiendas desde el principio.Ahora, en el caso de Gatsby, el es un hombre rodeado de mucho misterio porque nadie lo conoce bien, ni tiene familia o amigos a los que les puedas sacar su historia o que al menos te den un indicio de quien es Gatsby, que clase de hombre es.Estoy fascinada con cada uno de sus personajes, porque incluso en su superficialidad, sabes que hay mas profundidad en ellos, como Myrtle, uno no conoce sus historia completa y sale creo solo en una escena, pero se ve mucho acerca de como es, con Wilson, con Tom, alrededor de sus ""amigos"", sabes que es una doble cara, sabes que tiene secretos que le oculta a cierta gente si y a algunos no, y eso es lo que pasa con cada uno de sus personajes. Lo que Nick dice acerca de ellos, mas las escenas mismas, su forma de hablar, las cosas de las que hablan, son un gran equilibrio para darte cuenta de quienes son."
171,David Rush,"The fact that I don't remember it probably proves my fear that I am more susceptible to subliminal suggestion than I think I should be. You see one day recently I had a sudden but strong urge to re-read The Great Gatsby and fortunately found many used copies in the used book store I frequent (where it just happens I work).Anyway, a few days after that I saw a commercial for the new Gatsby movie, and even though I really thought I had spontaneously decided to read it, it is much more likely I caught a glimpse of the ad and unthinking tucked it just out of conscious view.That said, I only read it once before and then as an adult, having defiantly, and in retrospect stupidly, refused to read it for a high school lit class. And although I read it sometime in the last 5 to 10 years all I remembered was that I told people that I liked it. So this was almost like reading it for the first time.From my middle aged perspective I can see why it is considered a classic and I can also see why I probably only read a few pages in high school and threw it aside. For me the characters are somehow simultaneously shallow and complicated, and the story itself even more so. And I have to admit that in high school my literary depth never got much past A Separate Peace and even that was a stretch.Reading Gatsby also clarifies for me why I didn't do well in lit class even if I had to read a book I enjoyed. In Gatsby there are loads of allusions, possible metaphors, foreshadowing and other literary attributes one could write a paper about. But for me that would take all the joy out of reading and letting all of the possible meanings and ambiguities roll over you as you read. Of course I suppose I could read it once for delight and then for possible analysis, but since I don't now and haven’t for years had to read to write a paper to get a grade I'll just hang onto what I have and luxuriate in its ambiguity.So yes I think it is a great book and the more I reflect in general about what I just read the more I feel that way. But gun to my head, had to write a paper about it for high school or community college American lit class I am pretty sure anything I could come up with would NOT be what the teacher might be hoping for.And writing this just now make me kind of want to read it again already. BUT now I'm off to Neuromancer by William Gibson."
172,Aragorn,"E' un libro pieno di sole. Non è il sole di Hemingway, che brilla sui poveri, sugli oppressi e sui disadattati. Non è neanche il sole, pleonastico, di Kerouac. Il sole del libro di Fitzgerald rende languidi ed indifferenti, alle questioni sociali, ma anche alle altre persone, tranne a quelle che rappresentano il proprio, personale, american dream. E' un sole borghese, non proletario. Non per questo è, però, meno crudele, visto che è un sole partecipe dei falsi affetti e, quindi, del senso di solitudine che attanaglia l'uomo. Nel romanzo piove solo due volte; non che io mi sia messo a contarle, mi si impongono alla mente. La prima volta la pioggia annaffia i sogni coltivati in solitudine da Gatsby; sembra quasi lo champagne che celebra la sua visione, parziale e distorta, della vita. La seconda volta la pioggia non riesce a lavare via la profonda solitudine, la dura consapevolezza che il passato non potrà mai ritornare, neanche a colpi di ville faraoniche e feste sontuose.E' un libro essenziale e perfetto. Come tutte le cose perfette più che commentato va contemplato, e se la contemplazione si trasforma in estatica adorazione...non preoccupatevi, è normale."
173,shanay,"i freaking love this book.i don't really feel like doing a huge review of this book since i analyzed the crap out of it when i went back for my grade 12 english. i mostly just came here because i hate daisy so much and the fact that i kind of hoped for her and gatsby makes me mad. gatsby did everything, and everything for daisy and no matter what she still doesn't love him. i know you can't control your feelings or whatever, but daisy had never, ever told gatsby how she felt, she let him believe that there was something there for him. and somehow she even convinced him to take the blame for myrtle's death which caused tom to go after gatsby and murder HIM! i hate her, i made sure everyone knew it too. but i loved the book. i felt so sad for gatsby and his delusions, and nick for just being sucked into it all. him and gatsby were good guys. everyone else had secrets and lies and tom is an ass for marrying daisy and having myrtle on the side... and being a complete arrogant asshole.this book made me feel a lot of things. but also, i put all that energy into an extra credit assignment that i had for grade 12 english.that's right, i made a gatsby board game.the sad thing about it though, is it was only played once, when it was a prototype. but it's a fully functional game and i'm so very, very proud of it. it's called ""do you know gatsby?""i hope one day i'll get to play it.now i feel like i want to read this all over again."
174,Vincentvanbeest,"Geweldig, volgend jaar weer."
175,Sandra Fahrlender,"I enjoyed this classic. Very male driven, fast and to the point....it's only 9 Chapters! But surprisingly enough, written well to build characters and care about what happens to them. Also, you will need to read between the lines since Fitzgerald does not openly let you ""know"" certain things, but assume them. Excited to see the new movie, which has Leo Dicaprio as Gatsby. I could easily reread this book again."
176,Nelson Luna," The Great Gatsby is a marvelous novel about a man who is deeply in love with the wealthy beautiful Daisy Buchanan and would do anything to get her. This novel is amazing and well written. The author F. Scott Fitzgerald writes this novel about a man name Jay Gatsby who is deeply in love with a beautiful women named Daisy Buchanan. Jay Gatsby loses the love of his life when he goes to combat. But she promises Jay that she will be here when he comes back. When Jay comes back Daisy is already married to a wealthy man named Tom Buchanan.There are plenty of characters in this novel but the main characters are Nick. The setting takes place in New York. Whether it's in East egg, West egg or the valley of ashes.East egg is a place where the middle class live. The valley of ashes is the worst. Well that's where the poor live. At the valley of ashes there is a billboard and that billboard has eyes. It sees everything you don't want to be seen. Last is West Egg. West egg is where the rich live. It's filled with beautiful houses and have a great view of the river. Caraway the one telling the story. Then there is Daisy and Tom Buchanan and Myrtle and George Wilson. And lets not forget Jordan Baker Daisy's best friend. Last but not least Jay Gatsby. Nick Caraway is a man who works as a bonds salesman who moves to east egg where the middle class live. He is related to Daisy Buchanan. Daisy Buchanan is married to Tom Buchanan whose family is wealthy. They live right across Nick. Across Nick there is West egg where the wealthy live. Myrtle and George Wilson live in the valley of ashes where the poor live. Jordan Baker is a pretty tall wealthy golf player who has a romance with Nick Caraway. And well Jay Gatsby. He is the man who was poor and later became rich and ends up having the girl of his dreams. Well for at least a second. ."
177,Riley Nilsen,"My favorite line of the Great Gatsby, written by F Scott Fitsgerald is “to reserve all judgment is a matter of infinite hope.” When I first read this, I immediately aligned with the statement but found faults in my ability to reserve judgments on a day to day basis. Nick Callaway is determined to not judge the upper class of West Egg, New York, when he moves there for business. Yet, reading the book through his eyes, Nick commonly goes against his words as we are able to know his every opinion and learn how his perceptions are altered by what others have to say. The book highlights what we often try to ignore;womanizing, affairs, lies, and our own ability to let others make poor decisions while we fail to say anything which will ultimatly only help thecause. The Great Gatsby opened my eyes to searching for the great in people versus being a bystander waiting for something exciting to happen."
178,Brandon Stumpf,"The Great Gatsby is possibly one of the greatest pieces of American Literature of all time! This book beautifully captures the Roaring Twenties in America with fast cars, large parties, and lots of alcohol. Despite this book not even being 50,000 words, there is so much packed into this! Affairs, murder, desire, jealousy, suicide, sex, alcohol, and partying. Besides all that stuff, this book mainly focuses on the failure of the American Dream in the early 1920's. It's also about Gatsby's desire for Daisy Buchanan, the love of his life. There's so much more to say about the Great Gatsby, but I'll leave it there. This book truly is a ""Great"" piece of American Literature, and we are all in debt to F. Scott Fitzgerald."
179,Κώστας,"Καιρό είχε να με συνεπάρει τόσο ένα βιβλίο με την αριστοτεχνική του γραφή και δομή, με την ποιητική του γλώσσα, και τα νοήματα και τους συμβολισμούς του. Είχα υποτιμήσει λανθασμένα την Αμερικανική λογοτεχνία αλλά τώρα σκοπεύω να πιάσω ένα-ένα τα κλασσικά αριστουργήματα και να τα διαβάσω στα Αγγλικά, όπως τους αξίζει. "
180,Karuna Jaipaul,"It is not often that I feel this intense emotional connection to a book, one in which it's ending causes me to feel a everything from complete sadness and sympathy to great wonder and satisfaction.I am so astounded that in a mere 140 pages I could feel so many emotions, I'm currently at the stage where I'm staring at a wall trying to comprehend the beauty of The Great Gatsby.Now before I begin, I should tell you I'm a lover of happy endings. I adore books where the characters get to be together and live happily ever after with the person that they are truly and madly in love with. However, The Great Gatsby was none of the above and I think that just makes me love this book even more. The unlikeliness and the tragedy that it entails shook me to my core and in my world, this is what good books are made of.Fitzgerald's writing skills are truly a spectacle to behold and he wooed he from the start with his flamboyant language and words.The Great Gatsby is such an in dept, symbolical, passionate book and I have a feeling for that next few days James Gatz's story will incessantly plague my thoughts. "
181,Eliza,"4/1/2013: As extraordinary a novel as it ever was. (I can't believe how long it's been since I read it--and oh dear, the marginalia in my high school copy is painful!) Not that I ever questioned its literary value, though I was a bit worried that it could never quite live up to its reputation, its unquestioned preeminence in the canon (even if it's the high school canon!). But--yup, it can. Fitzgerald writes the most amazing prose, the kinds of sentences that you want to read aloud to whoever is near you, that you want to say, ""look, how did he do this?"", that you want to internalize or memorize to help you see the world, somehow, the way he does. His word choice and imagery are rich and sometimes outlandish, yet it all works; his rhythm flows and swirls, changing to support the tone of each passage; his scenes and characters are summed up perfectly, with not an extra rag of a phrase or adjective to distract the reader. He packs a universe into 121 pages.And the perhaps too overt symbolism, and the sense of arch weary cynicism, and the required tragic outcome--those aspects of the novel that (some might argue) threaten to overwhelm it? Well, I'll defend them as necessary, if only as a reflection of the period and the author and the world he is trying to capture. And what a world it was. I only hope that Leonardo di Caprio (in the movie coming out next week) can do it justice."
182,Emily Hemmer,"A re read of this book for the fifth or sixth time has confirmed its place in my heart. A masterpiece of American literature. If you haven't read it yet (and you've had nearly a hundred years to do so), what are you waiting for? This book has the distinction of carrying two of my top five favorite lines from literature: “There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.” and “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.” Could there be a better narrative for the human condition? For the way we try and struggle and along the way get stopped, beat up, pushed back. But we keep trying. It's who we are. There are people who will never read this book because they think it's pretentious with its flowery prose and high ideas. But at its heart it's a story of the human condition - both the good and the bad. This book has established its place in history for a reason. "
183,Brittney,"I am not usually a fan of ""classic"" novels, but after abandoning this book back in high school, I gave it another shot for a class.Unfortunately, I fell completely in love. I absolutely love this novel and all it implies. Gatsby is this over-nostalgic, ambitious dreamer who has devoted the last five years of his life to one woman, Daisy. I love Gatsby and his foil for the American Dream, and how we tend to end up disappointed when things do not turn out as planned. (or, at the bottom of a pool...)Anyways, The Great Gatsby may indeed be my favorite novel I have read thus far in my 22 years on this earth.We'll see, but this one is hard to beat.If you love the glitz and glamour of the Roaring 20's mixed with the brutal reality of the backbreaking work to get there, this book is for you.With the awkward love triangle between Jay Gatsby and Daisy and Tom Buchannan, you will be glad that you're not a single bond salesman named Nick Carroway or a famous female golfer named Jordan Baker. Most of all, you'll be glad you're not Tom's whore, Myrtle Wilson. "
184,Maisie,"Sometimes I just think about this novel and I get emotional and am in awe of how eloquent, how poetic, how pensive Fitzgerald was. The words are cleanly put together and are so poetic after you dissect what has been written.Every now and then I feel like going back and reading it. It may be one of those books I read once a year or something because I love it that much."

186,Jhe9,"The roaring 20's an era of music, parties, and liquor. It was a time of rising and great expectation. America was just starting out in crafting what could be the impossible ""American Dream."" However, this is the story of man who has achieved that dream yet fell to the hands of a cruel unbecoming fate. An eye-witness to these events, Nick Carraway Gatsby's friend and neighbor, recounts the tragedies of Gatsby's blind ambitions from his own literary perspective. This is a tale of woe, wealth, and the ambitiously blind pursuit of happiness. The Great Gatsby is packed with a chain of trials of love: affairs, triangles, and questionable affections. At the same time the story is filled with mystery and majesty that shrouds the true identity of ""The Great Gatsby."" But the true purpose of this tale exemplifies the explicit truth of our world, a cruel place filled with tragedy, greed, and desolation. Jay Gatsby was a foolish victim, absorbed by his own blind search for what was mistaken as ""happiness"" as he sought out the elusiveness of love, but as a result he had to pay the terrible consequences. We are the people that make up this vast world. This American classic unveils the true colors of the people who live in this society. Perhaps it mirrors that of today's world. We are shallow, materialistic, and greedy. We seek riches and the lavish lifestyles. We have succumbed to indulgence over substance. This is the place where social status, materialism, and carelessness have governed our lives. Yet Gatsby achieved these riches in hopes of finding his apparent happiness, but instead he was welcomed to loneliness, false friendships, and a cruel end. A lesson that should be taught to all. And I believe it is accurate to say that Gatsby was ""a man who has everything, but nothing."" (The quote's original source from Iron Man) Even now I am having a difficult time digesting what I have just read moments ago. But I am glad to learned something new: the dark truth. My condolences to the ""Great Gatsby."""
187,Gina,"I first read this book over 25 years ago and as a teenager, so much of it went over my head until I bought the Cliff notes and everything clicked- it ended up being one of my favorite books read in high school. Rereading it now was nostalgic- if Fitzgerald was a modern writer, I'm sure I'd find complaint in his style, but because I have such fond memories of the story, I can only say that I enjoyed reading it so much more this time as a grown up. (It doesn't hurt to think of Gatsby as a Robert Redford/Leonardo DiCaprio type of guy, and I just couldn't help but feel sorry for him.)"
188,Tatiana Arutyunova,"I watched the beautiful movie with Leonardo DiCaprio in June 2013 and was impressed by the touching emotional love story and the iniquity of fortune. One year later I was looking for a new book to read and suddenly saw ""The great Gatsby"" on one of the bookshelves. But the book had to lay on my shelf half a year more before I finally began reading.The language was quite difficult for me at first but when I reached the third chapter I got used to it. I sincerely enjoyed each passage, each line and each word.The author chose absolutely befitting words to depict sceneries, main characters and their relationships. I also liked that the novel is written from the first person, such novels attract me because of the subjectivity and the fact that emotional coloring is better signified when the narrator takes part in events described in the book. Moreover, such kind of narration makes the reader feel as if he is also the participant and he drowns in the book even deeper.I was also impressed by lots of metaphors and secret senses hidden between the lines. I enjoy reading books that contain symbols because they make me widen my scope.The green light represents Gatsby's dreams, wishes and hopes. ""He stretched out his arms towards the dark water in a curious way, and, for as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling"". Jay was striving after his dreams in the same way as he wanted to reach the green light. His main wish was to repeat the past, he believed it was possible. I think one of the ideas of the novel is that past can never be recalled and people should enjoy their lives at present. Besides, the weather is connected with the mood of main characters - the day when Jay and Daisy met for the first time after five years shows the renovation of their love like the sun comes up after the rain. Francis Scott Fitzgerald found perfect words to describe the way those two communicated when they finally met: ""I don't believe they heard a sound. They were sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if some question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was gone.""Moreover, the day when Gatsby wanted Daisy to confess Tom that she never loved him was the hottest day of summer. Daisy seemed to suffocate and not only because of the hot weather. I may say that everybody's temper was hot that day and both Tom and Jay were close to blowing up. And the last detail about weather - the day of Gatsby's death was the first day of autumn, the saddest time of the year when nature seems to die. The eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg were the eyes of God for Wilson, he was the only one in the novel who believed that those eyes could see everything and, moreover, disapprove of people's deeds.When I watched the movie I thought that the central theme was love. But when I began reading the book I understood that there were some other things which Francis Scott Fitzgerald wanted to show the reader about the ""Jazz Age"". The author showed that moral and conscious were decayed at that time. People had the desire of easy money and endless parties. Even the love-line confirmed that people strived after money those days in the first place. ""She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me."" Gatsby committed a crime by bootlegging in order to impress Daisy with his money. But, as the reader could notice, money couldn't help Jay to end up happily with his beloved. To be honest, I didn't expect that Daisy who seemed to be truly in love with Gatz and so unhappy with Tom would turn out to be such a Judas.But after the terrible accident the narrator mentioned that Tom and Daisy ""weren't happy, and yet they weren't unhappy either.""Although, the novel is about imprudence which is so typical of young people who resist to changes, without love story it wouldn't have made any sense. I really loved the novel, it is definitely one of my favorite books now. I couldn't help crying at the end and even few days after I finished the book I felt that I still wasn't over the novel and wasn't ready for another book. It pulled my heart strings and left a great field for thought. The fate was unjust to Jay Gatz and he didn't deserve it at all. But that's the way it can be in our real life, what makes me even sadder. I'm sure that Gatsby's love was real but it wasn't worth fighting for it the way he was.Sometimes pictures from the movie arose in my head and made my own vision of the story more colorful. In conclusion I can say that this book is worth reading not once."
189,Sam Hamilton,"Although some people may disagree with what I'm about to say, I'll say it anyways. I have to say that The Great Gatsby is a great book to read. I found it amazing and funny for this type of book. The story line was amazing and keep to the story not wondering off. I would recommend this book for others to read. Not just because the ending was crazy but because it was a good story. The story is about a guy name Gatsby. But the story is seen though the eyes of Nick. A friend and lives by Gatsby. So the rest of the story is for you to find out. Trust me when I say this is a good and amazing book to read. "
190,Eugenia (Genie In A Book),"
 
Now that, my dear friends - is a piece of quality writing.
*MINI REVIEW:*This book left me speechless - the writing style, the characters and the overall cohesiveness of the storyline was amazing and well thought-outWe are told of the events occurring in Jay Gatsby's life from the perspective of one of his close friends Nick Carraway. I found this quite an interesting approach and perspective which suited the book well. The novel is full of vivid imagery and the language that Fitzgerald uses had me in awe with his ability to pull the reader so deeply into the story. This book did have a tragic end unfortunately, and things do not exactly end on a bright and rosy note. In a way Fitzgerald made everything so cleverly ironic that you come to think that really, everything ended just as it should have.I would definitely recommend this as one of the must-reads and best literary classics of the 20th century!PS. I hope the movie is just as good as the book!"
191,Bec D,"OMG, how can anyone not love this book???!the writing is a-mazing. i can't believe Fitzgerald was 29 when he wrote it. if you are feeling down-and-out read the first few pages and the last couple of pages. you may just find yourself there. such a huge contribution to understanding the human condition, particularly in analysing social class and power, the great american dream and love (he's quite pessimistic about the power of love to have any effect on changing your life; in fact it blinded gatsby - or was that his desire for the dream?). actually, it's quite a pessimistic novel - that was my general feeling - because desire is confused with love. how can we tell the difference? The moral of the story is really: ""be careful for what you wish for because you just might get it.""definitely a book that i will read many times before i die. i sometimes feel anxious when i don't have it near me. :) i never tire from reading those words: ""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past"" - that's purgatory in a nutshell. "
192,Harsha Priolkar,"This book has me firmly in its thrall! I am very ambivalent towards classic literature in general, but this one is undeniably a gem of story with luminous prose & brilliantly etched characters. Really Fitzgerald's prose must be read to be believed and as I have said elsewhere, savored slowly, like your favorite single malt! Smooth, with a fiery afterglow, it transforms what is essentially a love story into an epic of mesmerizing intensity. Jay Gatsby, Daisy Buchanan and Nick Carraway have already passed into the realm of legend and I finally understand why. Also you have to LOVE a book that reads like an epic but is just 115 pages long!Read my full review here http://crazygoangirlreads.wordpress.c...I know I'll be reading this book many many more times - it's just that kind of book!"
193,Esdaile,"Originally I gave this book just three stars and no review. The reason that I made new review was because I only had a vague memory of the story and a vague memory of the film starring Robert Redford. Recently I moved house and have had the chance to have proper bookshelves erected so that most of my 4000 or so books are now on shelves and in single instead of double rows. ""The Great Gatsby"" reemerged from a dark cellar and I decided to read it again. Some books should be read when one is younger, some when one is older. I think this book belongs to the latter class. I appreciated it very much the second time round. It is a very sad, a lyrical and a subtle book. So much has been said about the ""jazz age"" and Scott Fitzgerald so closely associated with a particular epoch, that I think readers can be dazzled and not see how subtle this tale really is. Above all, it is the sad story of a man and a woman who think they can ""go back"", to relive or rebegin a young love, but you cannot ""go back"" in that sense and you should not try. The narrator is a somewhat colourless character (reminds me of Darley in the Alexandria Quartet or Ryder in Brideshead Revisited) who may I suspect reading the book a second time, be in love with the same woman as Gatsby loves. The book is also a deeply fair book. People are presented as they are but not made worse than they are. Still, the narrator's creation Tom has the last laugh (a hollow one) over the writer who created him. Tom claims at one point, ""Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they'll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white. Flushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization...."" Well, Tom is a monumental hypocrite, having himself a passionate afafir with the mechanic's wife, but if the writer wants to state that the prognosis is gibberish, then it is Fitzgerald who retrospecitively comes out with egg on his face at this point and not Tom! This book is replete with such thought provoking spats, comments and observations. I especially liked the writer's observation that there is no difference between men more profound than that between the sick and the well. ""The Great Gatsby"" reminds me of Shakespeare's Timon of Athensin one important aspect, namely the ingratitude of friends or those who call themselves such. How many friends does a man or woman have who are onyl fair weather firends. Who have excuses on their lips when they have to do something for the people who have been kind or generous to them, who are only friends for what they can get? At the end we realise that Gatsby's best friend was his neighbour, the narrator, whose final and touching gesture for Gatsby is to erase an obscene message that someone has scrawled on Gatsby's delapidated house. "
194,Olivia Star,"The Great Gatsby is by far one of the most amzing books to read. It takes time and patience to read, but it is worth it when you finish it. The style of writing the F. Scott Fitzgerald writes in is stunning, it has a certain way of making you read that makes you want to just keep on reading it. If I had to pick the most interesting character in the book, it would be a tie between Jay Gatsby and Daisy. They are intriguing characters, Gatsby is a man of mystery and Daisy is exactly like her name, a flower. If you are looking for a great piece of classical literature that holds a lot of insight, then I would recommend this book to you. "
195,M.m.f,"Fue hermoso. Literalmente sus palabras me llegaron completamente. Fue hermoso. Seguramente algún día lo vuelva a leer, y otra vez, y otra vez.Perfecto."
196,Mark Massey,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is considered one of the greatest books ever written since America was established. I personally enjoyed this book. This is my first Fitzgerald book, and I understand why my previous English teacher loved his work so much. The narrator, Nick, enjoys writing and does short stories and such, but he is actually invests in stocks. At first Nick writes about Jay Gatsby as he was some larger than life figure. I could feel the passion how Nick wrote about Gatsby. Fitzgerald does a great job of developing Jay Gatsby as a character, while successfully making most of his life a mystery. In fact, Fitzgerald does an excellent job at describing every detail of the book. For the people who like books that are In-media-res, this is not that type of book, Fitzgerald gives a detailed introduction about Nick and his background. The action doesn’t take long as the elaborate party scenes start to commence. Again the description of these parties makes you feel like you are there. The thing that shocked me was how modern these parties seemed to be even though they were in the 1920’s. The book continues on to tell how Gatsby and Nick’s cousin past relationship was like and how they got back together. One of my favorite lines in the book is Nick’s last words to Gatsby, “They’re a rotten crowd’, I shouted across the lawn. ‘You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together.” This is one of the emotional lines that shows hoe Nick really felt. I wrote this review while trying not to give away much of the plot."
197,D. Wayne Moore,"I've been hearing abut The Great Gatsby for a long time. This book is always among the first to be discussed during book club meetings and must be required reading in college. well, let me be the first to say it lived up to all the hype. Fitzgerald adroitly masterfully weaves a story about love, sex, infidelity, and unfulfilled dreams into a timeless epic that'll never be forgotten. Fitzgerald uses first-person POV and with that unleashes a flood gate of suspicion that the story is in fact an autobiography. However, Fitzgerald must've been suffering from split personality because it is clear to anyone who has read about his life that, not only is the narrator a mirror of Fitzgerald's life, Gatsby himself is also. It is a fascinating read and i highly recommend it to any writer who wishes to see how the masters did it. "
198,Corinne,I was initially assigned this book my sophomore year of high school. I read the first three chapters then read the SparkNotes for the rest. I thought it was boring. I went back and read it a little over a year ago and fell in love with it. I have since read it two more times. I love the depiction of the 20s and just the general feel of the book. 
199,Beth Anne,"i've read this book probably 10 times over the course of my life...and with the movie coming out, i decided i'd reread it again just to re-acquaint myself.then i found the audiobook was on sale for $5 and that jake gyllenhall narrated it, so i purchased it.i love this book. had given it 5 stars the first time i read it in high school...and would give it 5 stars every time thereafter. listening to gyllenhall read it was a pleasure. i actually wish that he was playing Nick in the film, after hearing this narration... but i'm sure Toby Maguire does a fine job.nothing much to say about a book that is already listed as one of the great american novels ever written...i agree. and will truly always love gatsby."
200,Ess A,"Essence AsamoahD Block 1/21/2014The Great Gatsby ReviewThe Great Gatsby is a well known novel that tells the tale of five young and wealthy characters living in New York in 1922. Jay Gatsby, a mysterious but very wealthy man lives right across the bay from his true love; Daisy Buchanan, a girl that is already married. The story is told in the role of Nick Carraway, a young graduate from Yale and the cousin of Ms. Daisy Buchanan. Nick soon becomes close to Jordan Baker (Daisy's best friend) who tells him about the secret love between Jay and Daisy. The book is a fantastic thriller that brings you into the true life of Jay Gatsby and how far one man will go for love. This book is a must-read! It really makes you feel like a young character from in 1920's. Gatsby is one of the most amazing characters that I have ever read about. His role in the novel challenges Daisy and makes her question what real love is. There is so much about this book to like! It really makes you think about what love is to some people, and how wealth and popularity can seriously control the relationships around you."
201,Desiree Wills Velazco,I understand why its a classic. Beautifully written. I wish Fitzgerald would describe me. i adore his descriptions of people!
202,Jay Gertzman,"I have read a statement to the effect that Fitzgerald “agrees” with Tom Buchannan about the “Nordic Race” –or the “passing of the great race” article that Tom parrots. Not fair! Does Philip Roth agree with the brother of the narrator in _Operation Shylock_, who makes the case that Israel should give no ground to the Arabs because a nation state is the only instrument that gives (has given!) the long-persecuted Jews a chance for spiritual and moral survival?  _Gatesby_ is a modernist epic, although certainly not in the sense that, say, _Ulysses_ is. _Gatesby_ is about the American Dream. The power of its last sentences work only in that context. Fitzgerald surveys the kinds of people who have made that Dream work, for themselves of course. Wolfsheim is overtly shameful; this it is legitimate, and not anti-Semitic, to disparage him no matter how unlike A. Rothstein he may have been. Daisy, whose voice “sounds like money,” is equally so, once you understand how her need for it is principal to her “careless” state of mind. Tom’s power makes him even worse. These are major, “well bred” characters, and, contrasted to Wolfsheim, Jordan the cheating golfer, or Myrtle’s murderous husband, worse criminals, in part because they _are_ so dismissive of a parvenu Jew. I think Fitzgerald is saying that beyond every American fortune is a crime (and that was before our oil-driven wars of occupation!). The Dream is already “behind us.” An epic writer is in fact a visionary."
203,Jessica Madrid,"In The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald the author's message is that one can only live in a fantasy land for so long before it crumbles. We understand this message through event such as Gatsby creating a fake life and throwing elaborate parties for his love to notice him, but she never shows up. An important quote from the book is ""I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby's house I was one of few people that had actually been invited. People were not invited - they went there"" on page 41. This is important because it shows that Gatsby threw parties for one person who's attention he was after, but everyone but her came. His attempt at throwing parties and living in a fantasy failed when she never shows up. Another important quote is ""But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken luggage with them"" on page 164. In the end, when Nick attempts to call Daisy ,she doesn't answer her phone calls and later we find out that she had taken off with another man. In the end Gatsby's attempts at creating a fantasy life failed to impress and eventually crumbled. This book is very interesting to read and easy to be drawn into. Readers are drawn into the fantasies created by Gatsby making for an interesting read, but a let down in the end. At times, this book is addictive and easy to read continuously, which also makes the plot hard to follow. Throughout this book many major parts of the plot can only be understood if you have the ability to read between the lines. Although confusing at times, this book is captivating and an interesting read. This book is worth our time because it reveals through many events that creating a fantasy world to attract the attention of another isn't always beneficial. Even if it works and retrieves their attention, the end may result with all of the lies pouring out and leaving everyone in a bad position."
204,P.M.," The Great Gatsby, my review Describing F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel, The Great Gatsby, is like describing the Holy Grail. It is an enigma, no doubt, but does it hold up to its reputation? The diverse opinions on the subject flourish to this day. This is how it is with Fitzgerald’s writings. He possessed infinite insights of the 1920’s world of wealth, flappers and excess. Fitzgerald put a piece of himself into each of his novels. The Great Gatsby was no exception.  Fitzgerald wrote the Great Gatsby while living in France with his family during the latter part of the 1920s. He lived large and wrote from his personal observations. In the character of Jay Gatsby, Fitzgerald infused a lesser known part of himself. Like the author, Gatsby fell in love with ideals. In this case, it was Daisy Buchanan, a former love and current wife of the wealthy Tom Buchanan. Gatsby intent on winning back her affections loses sight of the bigger picture. To Gatsby, Daisy was a prize to attain at all costs. When Gatsby and Daisy were together in a previous life, outside the world of money and prestige, they clicked. She and Gatsby had met and fallen in love during the war, when Jay was a young officer with no money or position. Yet, it seems, Daisy may have grown bored of love without money. Nonetheless, Gatsby was blown by the winds of war, and as such, knew his love was fated.  In the ensuing years, Gatsby managed to amass his own fortune through the illegal sale of alcohol.  When Gatsby reconnects with his beloved Daisy, she is entrenched in a world of haughty materialism. Gatsby is blind to her shortcomings for he sees the lovely girl he fabricated in his romantic dream.  Meanwhile, Tom Buchanan, Daisy’s husband has a mistress, Myrtle Wilson, the wife of the owner of a garage in a less desirable area on the outskirts of town. It is this affair which, through mistaken identity, proves fatal for Gatsby.  The story is narrated by Nick Carraway, Daisy’s cousin and Tom Buchanan’s former school mate from Yale. Carraway, well aware of Tom’s affair and no fan of Gatsby, gives an objective account of the goings on in this self absorbed clique. Carraway, himself, rents a house near Gatsby’s and is witness to their daily pursuits. Initially, Carraway finds Gatsby's ostentatious and flamboyant existence beyond his tastes. In due course, however, Carraway sees Gatsby in a different light. He begins to understand what motivated Gatsby. His overzealous lifestyle was intended to impress his heart’s desire rather than satisfy a personal need.  Nick Carraway ultimately realizes that the Buchanan’s were pompous individuals who trampled over anyone who crossed them. Then they would retreat back into their wealth and let other people clean up the mess. He also realizes that Gatsby, the bootlegger who pursued his fortune, was “worth the whole damn bunch put together. This meant something, coming from the fallible and pretentious Carraway. Had Gatsby seen Daisy for what she really was rather than the romanticized version in his mind, he could not have loved her the way he did. Due to his inability to see her without his rose-colored glasses, he was doomed from the start. His love for Daisy is what motivated him to pursue his fortune in the first place.  In the end, it is up to Carraway to clean up the mess and tidy up Gatsby’s affairs. Gatsby, who always had a full house when giving a party, was nearly alone at his funeral.  The critics of the time praised Fitzgerald for his “irony, pity and a consuming passion. Like many of his characters, Fitzgerald closes in on life one detail at a time.  Now that we are in the 21st century, The Great Gatsby stands the test of time. The same human frailties which plagued society in the 1920s still present themselves today. Sure fashions and technology has changed but the basic human motivations remain the same. Fitzgerald showed us the world for what it really is, beyond the fantasies we build around it. "
205,Veljko,"I certainly waited a long time to read this - it has always been on the list, but I just never got to it. Somehow, I was not expecting it to be quite this pleasant of a read. Truly, it is not only a mesmerizing portrait of an era, it is also a compelling plot. Some of my favorite passages:""'Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.'""""Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.""""personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures""""life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.""""Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.""""There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and the tired.""""Americans, while occasionally willing to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry.""""No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.""""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning—— So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
206,Jordi Balaguer,"exquisit. Te un aire a Murakami, encara que potser Murakami te un aire a Scott Fitzgerald. Està molt ben escrit, i és romàntic, melancòlic, trist i preciós... com el plànol quinquenal dels Manel o la seva ""els guapos són els rares"", penso que el Gran Gatsby és pur en la seva mostra de la putrefacta superficialitat humana. M'evoca la idea cruel de que l'esforç en l'amor i la bellesa és nul. La vida, com la gent, és desagraïda. Molt recomanable."
207,Kwoomac,"At first, like Nick, I didn't know what to make of Gatsby. Things didn't add up. He seemed like a fraud. As the story evolved, so did my feelings about Gatsby. I'm sure it says something about me, but I love the combination of bluster and naïveté. Gatsby broke my heart with how unrelenting he was in his pursuit of riches in order to win over Daisy. Most men would have moved on. The fact that he threw all those parties while remaining aloof and unknown to his guests- this broke my heart.I didn't remember just how clever Fitzgerald was with his characters. At the same time he was tackling some very serious social issues, he managed to add comedic moments throughout. I don't have the book in front of me but I'm thinking of the drunken guest who ran off the road, the guy in Gatsby's library, the piano playing boarder. They all had some great moments. I'm going to rewatch the 1974 movie with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. My recollection was that they were perfect for their roles. The upcoming over-the-top remake with Leonardo DiCaprio boggles the mind. "
208,Emma Donnelly,"I loved this book. I think that the Great Gatsby is indeed one of the greatest novels ever written. This is because it accurately conveys the setting of a time in transition and desperation. Hope is ever so needed in times like such. The American Dream is an iconic symbol of hope and hard work. This book goes to show that the American Dream is unachievable. Money and white picket fences do not buy happiness. It is love at the end of the day that grants you happiness. The novel explores simple demographics relatable to todays society as well in attempts to explain why the cycle of poverty is so hard to break. For example the novel talks about how as long as there are people with reputable backgrounds and ""old money"" it will prevent those with lesser opportunities from achieving more. This places a certain pessimism in the atmosphere of specific settings or in the lives of certain characters in the book. It is really interesting to read about the struggle for people to attain their hopes and dreams and the measures in which people will take to get there. "
209,Aiden Howard,"I thoroughly enjoyed this piece of literature. Approaching this novel as a reader who had watched the movie close to fifty times but yet to indulge in the book I was very excited. I found myself enthralled in the pages of this book, finding the book and the movie almost mirror images of each other I really enjoyed spotting the differences though. I greatly appreciated the differences between that of the book and movie though, always keeping in mind that the book was how it was intended to be viewed. My three takeaways from this book would be: 1. Remain hopeful, hope is what keep us moving forward and gives us a reason to live. 2. Tying in with my first takeaway, my second would be to keep our hopes realistic so that we do not find ourselves disillusioned. 3. Never let that green light get away from you, never ever give up on it."
210,Marisol Vazquez,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald could be considered my favorite book. I am not trying to be a hipster teenage girl by saying a novel from the 1920s is one of my favorite books of all time. The facts are: - I am a teenage girl - I love a book from the 1920s.- I am not fond to any time era in particular.- I saw Leonardo Dicaprio as Gatsby, thus I can't be taken seriously.I love this book. I hate Daisy. I fell in love with Gatsby.Hormones, man. I'm tellin' ya.“He smiled understandingly-much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to face--the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.”Meeting a man like Gatsby, that is the American dream."
211,Rachel Bowman,"Many of my bookish friends have persuaded me to read this novel..and i can't believe that i didn't listen to them before!! I read this book in a day or so and i must say i was astounded by this book and especially with F. Scott Fitzgerald's flowing, poetic words."
212,Nathan Yocum,"There is something in us, in all of us. When we love, truly love, we form an image in our heads and project that onto the person standing in love's place. We make them greater, gentler, smarter, more ambitious, more beautiful. We fall in love with our own fictional account and are laid open as victims to whatever objective reality has in store. When the truth comes crashing it rips out our hearts and we realize that not only have we lost in love, but we have been fools.Fitzgerald understood this. The best books reveal truth about humanity. Gatsby speaks volumes of truth."
213,Douglas Himes,"I struggled with myself between giving this book 4 or 5 stars. Its style isn't my favorite and the social/moral messages, though resonant with me, have developed over the years into banal stereotypes. These qualities, I've decided, are forgivable; FItzgerald's genius and literary discipline is undeniable -- they carry the book and keep in relevant against the erosion of time. I've read that Fitzgerald furiously edited the book, removing any language he believed unnecessary, pouring over passages for deadweight, and it shows. The book absolutely shines, it's beautifully polished. In fact, it's polished to such an extent that passages intended to set the scene -- to take the reader on a mental journey into the setting -- almost always serve an auxiliary purpose, acting as thinly veiled commentary on the plot's happenings. Likewise, things are expertly foreshadowed, which is especially rewarding attentive readers. Perhaps most impressive is the book's ability to remain not only accessible, but enjoyable to a majority of its readers while possessing the depth and literary merit it has. That accessibility is ultimately why, despite ranking relatively low on a list of my favorites, I'm unable to deny The Great Gatsby a 5 star rating -- it is the very essence of a classic."
214,Tawny,"Favorite line: ""I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool."""
215,Nicole T,"1920s. Long Island Sound. East Egg, West Egg, and that Valley of Ashes that lies in-between. I love this novel, but I will agree that it took me a few reads to get to that point. While a very short novel, it takes until the last few chapters to get to the heart of the action. For those who enjoy suspense, the beginning can seem a little dry. Even though it's a fictional novel, I enjoy it for its cultural and historical perspective. Once you read the ending, it makes you want to go back and read it again (or at least that was the case for me). The descriptions of characters and their interactions with one another take on so much more meaning. Don't compare it to the movie; take the novel for what it's worth and read it at least twice. The more I teach it, the more I am engrossed by the characters and symbolism. By the end of the novel, there will be characters that you despise, and there will be characters that perplex you. That's okay. Great novels have complex characters and themes that get you to think."
216,AmyNikita,"The Great Gatsby glitters with high society jewels, and is swept with scandal. It's rich, deep, and amazingly written: definitely one of my favourite books ever! Still, it's also sad to see how those rich people's lives were so hollow; they just filled them up with parties and material luxuries. But that doesn't take anything away from the beauty that spills from the writing of this book. "
217,Amani Hafs,"One of the most amazing novels in the American Literature ,written by Scott Fitzgerald Its talking about the American dream each… character in This novel has a dream and wants to achieve it …MR Gatsby: who is hoping to win Daisy back.

218,Roos,"""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaslessly into the past.""I loved it, I loved it, I loved it. The writing was stunning, the characters amazing, the story so good and thought-provoking. Thank you for this, Mr. Fitzgerald."
219,Irina Dmitrenko,"Don't read if you are not through with the book, it's a spoiler! Great read! Couldn't put down. Love the language, beautiful writing! S.F. depicted the Eastern postwar society and its values vividly. The dream Gatsby build in 5 years was so fragile that a little accident destroyed him. Great empathy for Gatsby. Daisy is a disappointing empty shell. I think that Gatsby was obsessed with an idea of her than with the actual person. She was the price that would finalize his accomplishments. He'd value himself more if she was with him. He never belonged to the world of rich and his actions were directed by desire to be known and approved. I like how the author said that Daily and Tom crushed Gatsby, that they were careless and ruined people with their carelessness, running away from the mess they made and retrieving to their money. The difference between Tom's and Gatsby's money is that Tom was always with money and his life was stable. Gatsby's fortune was made quickly and dishonestly. Despite that, I was still rooting for Gatsby. I don't know if he really was in love with Daisy. It seems that he was so obsessed with the idea of their meeting when he can show her his accomplishments, impress her with his house, that who daisy was didn't matter any more. S.F. mentioned that Gatsby payed a price for dedicating himself to one dream for so long. It was incredibly sad when nobody cared about his company, nobody, not even his father, really knew him. "
220,Amanda pepos,"I have read this book so many times I""ve lost count. ""Gatsby"" is my absolute favorite book. Mr.Fitzgerald weaves together the most beautiful sentences with the roaring way of life in the 1920's. Nick's naivety is always fantastical to me, and everytime I read ity, I always hoipe that Daisy will choose Jay, I honestly dont know how she can't, but the character of Daisy is so vapid and selfish, she hurts peopel without care, and precusor to human behaviour in the current world. Despite all the themes and even some darkness, I still love this book, and will undoubtedly read it agasin. That's what you do with favorites."
221,Kendra Helton,"I actually had to read this book during high school, and I'm glad that I did because usually during school I never really got into the books until after I graduated. But this book was delightful to read and I'm glad I read it. The story itself was a little hard to read at first but once you got started to about the 2nd chapter it became extremely hard to put down. So I suggest you read this classic book by F. Scott Fitzgerald! "
222,Sandown Public,"I 19m actually hesitant to write this review, because I know that whatever words I choose to use cannot possibly live up to this masterpiece of a novel. I was initially expecting it to be a fairly decent read because of all the hype about it from my English teachers, but I never thought I would like it as much as I do after having read it. It 19s by far the best book I 19ve had to read as an assignment in school (I had to read it for my American Literature class) and it may even be one of my favorite books of all time. Here 19s why.One of my favorite things about The Great Gatsby is the extreme abundance of symbolism lurks beneath its surface. I 19m not going to get into the debate of whether or not this symbolism was intended by Fitzgerald, because to me that 19s not really the point. The important thing for me is that it is present nevertheless. There is a seemingly endless web of connections that can be made with the symbolism in this story- the use of specific colors, the green light, the blue and yellow cars, Gatsby 19s mansion, and even Daisy herself. The list goes on and on and on, and I just love every bit of it. I know that every time I reread this book (because I will definitely be reading it at least one more time in the future) I will discover a new aspect of it that I didn 19t know existed before. As a reader, that is an immensely exciting prospect because it means that this wonderful story will never lose its spark.Another high point of this book is F. Scott Fitzgerald 19s beautiful writing. I mean, take a look at this quote: 1CI was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life. 1D (page 35)It 19s so flawless. Not only is it written eloquently, but it is incredibly easy to relate to. Often I feel these two extremes, especially when thinking about modern-day society and the various pros and cons of our current lifestyles. Some aspects of today are terrifying and disheartening to think about, yet at the same time there are components that are overwhelmingly good. Fitzgerald uses his mastery of language to evoke these personal connections with the reader throughout the entire novel, and it is this that gives the story its timelessness.I also loved the characters in this novel and how startlingly terrible they can be. Take Tom Buchanan, for example. He believes in white supremacy, is cheating on Daisy with another woman, and cares more about money and status than anything else. He looks down upon Gatsby 19s extravagant parties as frivolous and even immature, and he is beyond careless. But he is a multidimensional character with a distinct personality that could actually exist in the greedy, selfish world we live in- and that 19s something that doesn 19t exist in every story. Gatsby is both an enigma and all of us at once. Nick is a bystander who is irrevocably changed by this one summer. Daisy shows hidden intellect when she says, 1CI 19m glad it 19s a girl. And I hope she 19ll be a fool- that 19s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool. 1D (page 17)Each character has so much depth to them that it is as if they are actual people- and really, aren 19t they all reflected, if only a tiny bit, in each of us?I could go on and on and on about why I love The Great Gatsby so much, but for now I 19ll leave it at that. If you haven 19t read this novel, I highly, HIGHLY suggest it. At this point, it 19s actually more of a demand.READ THIS BOOK. IT 19S AMAZING.My Rating: :0) :0) :0) :0) :0). You shouldn 19t even have to ask.Would I recommend it to a friend: OH YES.Yours,HOLLY"
223,Rebecca,"Much better reviews have been posted here so I won't really try. All I can say is that I read this book in 11th grade for english class and actually enjoyed it. That is truly saying something. To get me to read a book for class was one thing, but to enjoy and actually have opinions on it was an out of this world phenomena only to be repeated once afterwards by To Kill a Mockingbird. I thoroughly enjoyed the setting of the Roaring Twenties and in the beginning, I felt like I really wanted to be at one of those parties. Ok yeah, its a good love story too with interesting twists in the end. Some of the book felt fake and a touch ridiculous, but so what? I don't want to be bored with real life so why not get immersed in something over the top sometimes.I really with all my heart and soul do not understand how this book has this low of a rating that it does on goodreads. It must be one of those love 'em or hate'em books like The Catcher in the Rye. But to me, there isn't really anything a person can say that will every take away the love and enjoyment I get from reading this book, and that's the most important thing."
224,Ellyn Oaksmith,"The Great Gatsby is currently experiencing a sort of revival due to the recent movie, with Leonardo DiCaprio, which is why my book club picked it. Oddly enough, when I finished the book, my first thought was that it was the perfect length. There is so much languid boozing and growing fury in this book that it wouldn't stand even one more page but even more than that, it's utterly perfect in it's laying down of the story, reaching the exact right moment to puncture the overripe ennui and then it ends, rapidly, perfectly and with such sadness. It is one of the novels that is praised to the high heavens and justly so. Gatsby is one of the saddest and greatest characters in American literature. At the end we know so little of him and yet we've heard his whole story.The words that Fitzgerald uses: ""peppering of stars,"" ""scalloped beach,"" and his ""careless people who smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money"" are picked as if he writes with diamond clarity on his first draft. No one, in my humble opinion, could labor over these sentences, they flow with such clarity and brilliance. I don't think that I could have gotten the central premise of this book when I first read it in high school. It is preoccupied with a man trying to recapture the past. And people who run away from the present into the future and past. The whole book is about time and how we are rarely in the moment. The timelessness of this theme is what separates good literature from great. This is one of the greats and it certainly bears many re-reads. This isn't the last time I will read this book."
225,Captaincow,"Bewertung: 5.0 / 5.0Meinung:""Der große Gatsby"" ist das wohl bekannteste Werk von Francis Scott Fitzgerald. Die Geschichte hörte sich sehr interessant an und ich mag sowieso Romane, die in den 20ern/40ern/50ern in New York oder in der Gegen um New York spielen, also musste ich dieses Buch unbedingt lesen - und meine Erwartungen wurden nicht enttäuscht.Das Buch lebt nicht nur von der Atmosphäre der ""goldenen Zwanziger"", sondern auch von gut ausgearbeiteten Charakteren, einer interessanten Geschichte und dichten Beschreibungen.Demzufolge muss man sich Zeit nehmen für dieses Buch; es nicht im Stress lesen, sondern Seite für Seite, Wort für Wort genießen. Nervenkitzel und Spannung kann man hier nicht erwarten, dafür aber eine größtenteils ruhige Erzählung, die einen direkt in einen trägen Sommer in der Nähe New Yorks versetzt.Darüber hinaus sollte man nicht davon ausgehen, dass die Geschichte besonders gefühlvoll oder so ist. Der Ich-Erzähler ist nämlich nicht Gatsby, sondern jemand anders. Was mir allerdings gut gefallen hat, denn so erfuhr man verschiedene Sichtweisen der Geschehnisse. Zudem war es interessant zu lesen, wie ein Charakter innerhalb der Geschichte über den anderen Charakter dachte. Und es war nicht dramatisch oder wirkte auch nicht wie eine schon häufig geschriebene Geschichte.Francis Scott Fitzgerald schreibt schön, ästhetisch irgendwie, ohne dabei die Dinge zu verfälschen oder aufzuhübschen. Man könnte das Buch wegen des Schreibstils und der recht nahtlosen Handlung fast mit einem kleinen Bach vergleichen, der so vor sich dahinplätschert und sich ständig vorwärts bewegt.Ich kann das Buch also nur weiterempfehlen, allerdings nur denjenigen, denen die Inhaltsangabe und die Art des Buchs zusagen."
226,Sherry Kneece,"My favorite book to teach. A college favorite. A study of longing, loneliness and sorrow. "
227,Page Terror,"Page Terror Reviews: pageterror.wordpress.comI have read F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby on the fourth of July every year since I was twelve years old. I am very much aware that I have promised the reader a review on Henry James’s The Bostonians. However, I feel that tradition in this instance takes precedence and that James can always wait another week. Gatsby holds not only a unique place in the black pit that is my heart, but also in the world of the twentieth century novel. A social history of America during the 1920′s, Fitzgerald critically assesses the growing developments and the coinciding flux of values that percolated throughout the age, exploding with the inevitable defeat of man’s spiritual being by the impounding dominance of materialism. The narrative is a beautiful balance of simplicity and bounding poetics, wrapped up in the dark mysticism of possibility and the timeless allure of slow and unavoidable ruin. The characters are products of their context. It is through his portrayal of types and the boundaries that they may cross that Fitzgerald is able to bring to life the reality of his period. His elegant and yet brutally honest fixtures are not at the mercy of a universe that he has plucked out of the ether. Instead, they are the world and what we see exudes from their speech, actions, and the nature of their internal dichotomies. Each possesses an inner battle that reflects the age that they were created to mirror. Even Nick, who as the narrator only exists in relation to the people and story he is depicting, fights for understanding, causing him to hover in a multi-dimensional construction. There is the misconception that Gatsby is about the Roaring Twenties, the decade of sin and continuous partying that people partook in to overcome the catastrophic effects of the First World War. The glittery and undeniably sad actuality of this piece and time cannot be denied. However, what The Great Gatsby is truly about, where the irrevocable magic of the story extends from, is not the party scenes. It is not the mob allusions, the mansions, or the fancy cars. At its core, The Great Gatsby is about the transcendence of the human spirit, the innate connection of the individual with the universe, and its promised destruction. We witness this in Jay the moment before he kisses Daisy and then we watch as it is resigned and burned and Jay becomes in essence mortal, a demi-god who has relinquished his immortality for the physical. I will end this little ditty by informing my reader that Daisy is my favorite character and that she always has been. The reader can easily write her off as irritating and weak and she can be both of those things. However, that is not all of Daisy and to do so does not only comment on your own lack of empathy, but it is also an insult to Fitzgerald. Daisy is the great tragedy of the novel. To characterize her with her worst attributes is to reduce her to the mere shadow of a person, not acknowledging her as a full-bodied individual with potential. We as the reader have the privilege to see that potential rise once more from the ashes before collapsing in final defeat, submitting to the destiny that was created for her at birth by those who sought to dim the light that would continue to flicker, green across the bay, before disappearing forever into the fog. pageterror.wordpress.com "
228,Mona Benach,Just reread this and was so happy I did. Wonderful book that does so much in very few pages. Excellent capture of a timeless moment. 
229,Realteenreviews,"The GistNick Caraway moved to West Egg and things in his life changed. Not just because of the careless, irresponsible people, but the over-the-top, party-every-night atmosphere of Long Island. He's a working man, and working men like him - without endless family money to fall back on - live in the much less fashionable West Egg, right across the Sound from East Egg, the place for wealthy people who don't have to work. Immediately he is alerted to the differences when his next door neighbor, Jay Gatsby, throws a party to which every person in West Egg and beyond goes to. At the other end of the Sound, on East Egg, Nick meets with a distant cousin, Daisy, her husband, Tom Buchanan, and a friend of their's Jordan Baker. Though Daisy is beautiful and exciting, she's not everything. No one from East Egg, or even West Egg, for that matter, seem to be all they appear, or all they want to be. Including, the mysterious Gatsby.What We ThinkReviewed by Dream CatcherNumber of Pages: 180 Let me tell you (though you probably don't need much telling) reading a book for class is no simple feat. I love reading. Everyone who's ever read anything I've written should know that. But somehow - and it's always been like this - reading a book for class lacks the usual shimmer of reading for yourself. But this book wasn't that way. I couldn't wait to read it everyday for class and discuss it with my American Lit. teacher. So great. This is one of my all-time favorites. I find myself wondering lately, though, if my love of the author has clouded my judgement as far as how I actually feel about the book. F. Scott Fitzgerald is awesome. But I think I love the book because it's truly a fantastic piece of writing, not just because it was written by Fitzgerald. Love.What I love most about this book is what I'm going to address first. The writing style. Out of all the aspects of this book the writing style is my favorite. It's slightly poetic with enough description to understand your surroundings and be satisfied without ever being bored. He uses a lot of metaphor to get his point across, which I like. I really don't know.......To Read the Rest of the Review Please Click the Link Below:http://realteenreview.blogspot.com/20..."
230,Rob Walter,"I reread this for the first time in at least ten years and it was even better than I remembered it. There is so much depth to the narrator's character, there is so much social commentary and there are so many questions about how best to live. I was tempted to just start back again at the beginning because I'm sure there are other dimensions I missed, but even if there weren't I would happily read it again focused on one of the above aspects.This is a masterpiece, if you're at a different stage of life than when you first read it, I recommend another visit, because it can still yield so much and so much more than many other books you've never read."
231,Joshua Benjamin,"The Great Gatsby captures the lifestyle of post WWI wealthy Americans. The way Fitzgerald's characters respond to the world and the motives they share really bring the audience into the roaring 20s atmosphere. Firstly, I learned that some of the dilemmas in the story are timeless. I also learned that the disillusionment in the air during this time is present in our world as well. Lastly, I was struck by the inclination towards hedonism at the time, but when I step back and view the world I live, it may be more hedonistic than Gatsby's. Great read overall. Appropriate and consistent diction and style."
232,Inaniel,sehr lesenswert. Vor allem das Ende. Aber auch der Anfang. Und die Mitte. hm...
233,Zach Greer, This was a great book i really enjoyed it. The book 'The Great Gatsby' was about a rich guy that kind of kept to him self most of the time. He was a mysterious man and lived in a huge house on a lake. Even though Gatsby kept to him self he hosted dinner partties at his house.  comparison to the book and the movie. The book was great and the movie was enjoyable as well. Some of the Differents of this book and the movie would be that in the movie they make it so Gatsby is a lot more social then he is in the book. In the book he is a lot more quiet i think. In the movie he is also seemed to be a lot less mysterious then he is in the book. i would recommend this book definentaly because i enjoyed it and im not much of a reader so if i enjoyed it then you will to. I enjoyed the characters in this book especially Gatsby because he was a wealthy man and he was mysterious he was just a really cool guy. The plot was very intresting for sure. If i was going to recommend this book to someone i would recommend it to maybe high school students because i read it in high school and i liked it and i thnk you have to read it in high school so have fun.
234,Tyler Webb,"This book was a descent read, nothing I was expecting and threw me off several times about what the final outcome was going to be. The main character Nick moves in next door to Jay Gatsby, in the West Egg, where the rich live but have no connections. It turns out that Gatsby doesn't fit the usual description of the residents and has parties every weekend. The story ravels around Nick and his interactions with characters like Jay, Daisy, Tom and Jordan to name a few. The ending was very fulfilling and the book kept me wanting to read to see what develops between the characters. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a drama, even boys because there is still a small 1920s gangster feel in the story."
235,Craig,"I'm torn on this one. (and first of all, yes... I really am reading The Great Gatsby for the first time, now.) It took me a while to slog through most of it and I really thought I would rate it a 3 at best. But by the end, something clicked. I don't know how to really explain that further, but I thought the ending of the book was fantastic and I really have been thinking about the story and characters a lot after finishing it. I'm going to leave it at four stars for now. It was a monumental mental battle to come up with a rating, though.Nov. 2013 edit... Up to five stars. The story and characters have really stayed with me."
236,Temitope Ajileye,"The Roaring TwentiesAfter World War I, the world rose again; and most of the world’s major cities underwent economic, social and cultural growth. There was prosperity like it had never been seen before; cars, telephones, motion pictures, and electricity made their way into every day life. Jazz music blossomed, the flapper generation redefined modern womanhood and Art Deco peaked.As usually the proportion of this changes, the roar of the zipping roadsters, of the crowded clubs, of the fanatic markets, was louder in America than in any other place in the world. The XVIII amendment, The Noble Experiment, later known as Prohibition, tried to strip the United States of alcohol and alcoholics. The only progress that came out of this was the black market development into national-size affairs, followed by a burst of violence, and the rise of personalities such as Al Capone. The wish to eradicate the origin of corruption led to the widespread of corruption among politicians and within police forces. In this swarming picture lived Scott and his wife Zelda, as well as Gatsby, Tom and Daisy (the protagonists of the novel), each of them with his own desires, fears and tragedies, his own moments of enthusiasm and sadness. They’re all seeking happiness, encircled by a lurking depression.Daisy Fay’s questThis novel could be the story of Daisy. Daisy was born in in a good family and was “by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville”. Like most girls of her age at that time, she desired a romantic love story. This seemed to happen when she met a young lieutenant, a man who looked at her “in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime”. When the officer was about to go overseas, Daisy wanted to go to New York to say good-by but was stopped by her family. She continued corresponding with him for a while, but could not wait for his return. She wanted to be loved, and to be loved at once.One year after she was conquered by the strength and wealth of another man, but the day before the wedding ceremony she received a letter from her previous lover which put her into despair. She was found drunk in her room, crying. However, after giving her a cold bath and some sprites of ammonia, the incident was over. Her husband soon started taking up lovers, while she grew more and more melancholic, more and more cynical. She enjoyed being the centre of attention, liked playing with men and still hoped to be liked and popular among them. This is the state in which Nick, his second cousin once removed, will find her.Tom Buchanan’s questThis novel could be the story of Tom. He is a very physical character, he possessed “a body capable of enormous leverage — a cruel body”. Tom comes from an old social and immensely wealthy family, and never backward about flaunting his richness. “…even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach”. He had been one of the most powerful football players at New Haven. Feisty and exited as he was, he couldn’t adapt to a life with the lady he married, nor to a permanent home; he “would drift on forever seeking”. When he moved with his family to East Egg, he came to know Myrtle Wilson, a stubborn and arrogant woman, whom he started dating. He was so found of her that not only he didn’t make any effort to cover up their story, but also introduced her as his girlfriend to Nick, whom he had met at college, just few days after Nick came to visit Tom and his wife.Jay Gatsby’s questThis novel could be the story of Jay Gatsby (is it?). Jay as a young man fell in love with a beautiful girl of Louisville, but had to leave to serve the U.S. Army in the Great War. After the War he shortly attended Oxford college, and when back home, found his lover married with a richer man. He “made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together” and made a decision, he was determined to “fix everything just the way it was before” not knowing he would pay a “high price for living too long with a single dream”.He made every legal and illegal effort to become richer, and, when he finally obtained an outstanding wealth, he settled in a big mansion near her place. He threw parties every weekend, inviting lots of people and accepting whoever rang his bell. He “half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some night”. For a long time Gatsby’s quest materialized into a green light, minute and far away, at the end of a dock, at the other side of the bay. He would sometimes, when sure to be alone, stretch out his arms towards it, trembling. This was the man Nick, his neighbour, came to know, the only one Nick would remember without disgust after leaving the East Coast."
237,Joelle,"In this amazing novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, he takes you back to the 1920's in the point of view of the main character, Nick Carraway. He tells of his adventures of growing up in life and learning the ways of people. In New York, the towns are filled with busy people and busy activities. One of them including going to parties at his neighbor's mansion. This neighbor, Mr. Jay Gatsby, turns Nick's life around in a matter of days. Gatsby wows people by his amount of wealth, his mansion, his cars, and again, his fiestas. People are drawn to them, but there is one person that was not drawn to them, and that was the whole point of throwing the parties. Nick's cousin, Daisy, appears to have history with Mr. Gatsby. After rekindling their relationship, many things change, and Daisy's marriage is strained. Carraway learns so much during this summer that he spent with old and new found friends, some good things and some bad things. This was the second time reading I had read this novel. The first time I read it, I absolutely fell in love, so I was delighted to read it again. It was just as good as the first time of course. Fitzgerald writes so beautifully. His novel is full of gorgeous similes and complex thoughts that make you revel on your own life. My copy is now filled with blue underlines and notes on the sides of pages. This is what I would call a classic novel, and I definitely look forward to reading it many more times in the future! "
238,Izzy,"I honestly think that everyone everywhere should study this book, not just read it, but study it. I liked it the first time I read it, adored the storyline and the beautiful descriptions etc. But this I really GOT it. So yes, wow this book"
239,Mazel,"Dans le Long Island des années vingt, la fête est bruyante et la boisson abondante. Surtout chez Jay Gatsby. Aventurier au passé obscur, artiste remarquable par sa capacité à se créer un personnage de toute pièce, Gatsby, figure solaire par son rayonnement, lunaire par le mystère qu'il génère, est réputé pour les soirées qu'il donne dans sa somptueuse propriété. L'opulence, de même que la superficialité des conversations et des relations humaines, semblent ne pas y avoir de limites. C'est pourquoi l'illusion ne peut être qu'éphémère. Parmi les invités de cet hôte étrange se trouve Nick Carraway, observateur lucide qui seul parvient à déceler une certaine grandeur chez Gatsby, incarnation de multiples promesses avortées. Ce roman visuel qui se décline dans des tons d'or, de cuivre et d'azur, s'impose également comme la chronique d'une certaine époque vouée, telle la fête qui porte en elle son lendemain, à n'être magnifique que le temps d'un air de jazz."
240,Cody,"I didn't really want to like this book. Mainly because I thought it beneath me and for high-school girls who want a mind-numbing, passionate tale of desperate (and selfish) lovers defying the odds of reality. But if we're friends, then you probably know that I can be a pretentious ass sometimes. If you didn't know that, you do by now. That said, The Great Gatsby is a book tailored for me. It begins and carries on as though my assumptions were right, painting the portrait of a Golden Age with status, class warfare, ""love"", money, affairs etc, but slowly I began to see past this clever deception to the symbolism/genius in F.Scotty's work. Deception permeates the the character's perceptions of themselves, inflating their own purposes/egos to step closer to the tantalizing status they all crave. Every character is striving to be - or have - something more. Whether it's money for Nick, class for Gatsby (even though he has money), love for Gatsby, ""true"" love for Daisy, status for those at the parties etc. etc. In a nutshell, every character is left wanting, except for one: Tom Buchanan. Tom is the fruition of everyone's ambition, and he's one of the biggest asses in literature. A cruel reality. He has class, wealth, Daisy, another lover, physique and in the end he ""wins"". He is the fruition of our(my) misguided intentions and the result of our(my) unconscious desire to be beheld. F.Scotty deceives us as we deceive ourselves. The harshness, and hopeful realization, of this reality is felt in the last chapter and more specifically, the last line. We are left to ""beat on, boats against the current"" of arrogance and money and egos and all of a sudden every decadent party is laced with the dead eyes of those ashen men and just maybe we have perspective. A few other thoughts inspired by/reminded by The Great Gatsby:""Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth."" - Thoreau""And the so-called real world will not discourage you from operating on your default settings, because the so-called real world of men and money and power hums merrily along in a pool of fear and anger and frustration and craving and worship of self. Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. The freedom all to be lords of our tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the centre of all creation. This kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But of course there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious you will not hear much talk about much in the great outside world of wanting and achieving.... The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day. That is real freedom."" - David Foster Wallace""This is water."" - David Foster WallaceYours, -C."

242,Gaëlle,"« Quand j'étais plus jeune, ce qui veut dire plus vulnérable, mon père me donna un conseil que je ne cesse de retourner dans mon esprit : ""Quand tu auras envie de critiquer quelqu'un, songe que tout le monde n'a pas joui des mêmes avantages que toi."" »C'est sur ce passage que s'ouvre le roman. C'est un livre de ""on dits"", de rumeurs, un roman sur la nature humaine reflet d'une époque fantasmée : les années folles.C'est peut être un conte Gatsby, un conte moderne sans magie, un conte américain avec un self made man pour prince, un conte sociologique, un conte philosophique. J'ai beaucoup apprécier la lecture, la fin parait inéluctable, y'a pas de happy end mais une conclusion sous forme d'une morale qu'on oubli trop souvent. "
243,Kristin-Leigh,"This book is a favorite of mine, such that I'm almost afraid to review it - how could I do it justice? Fitzgerald is THE writer of the white American Jazz Age, and this book has him at his most nuanced. Don't make the mistake of reading this as a love story - it's a book about class, it's a book about money, it's a book about the way people can become fixated on the idea of another person and the way it affects their self-image, it's a book about gender and race but Daisy and Gatsby are definitely not star-crossed soulmates, however well Robert Redford may have played that angle. "
244,Antonella,"Great for real!I can't believe I waited so long to read it, it's such a brilliant book; beautiful story and tragic at the same time. Fitzgerald's writing is simply perfect."
245,Angela,"Reviewing The Great Gatsby on Goodreads is kind of silly. Rereading it as I've been teaching it has been so good, though, and I figure I'd contribute my five-star review to counteract all the people who encountered it as required reading."
246,Brittany Jamison,"Alas what every high school English student is forced to read. And I, a junior, was no exception. I don't remember what I thought about it when I read it the first time. But I decided to read it again with the news that a movie version would be coming out this Christmas (it has now been moved to next summer). Anyway, second time around I not only appreciated it far more than I did I eventually fell in love with it. In the years since 11th grade I've read more Fitzgerald and his lyrical poetic style influenced me with my own writing. Beauty writ large. Thats one of the main things I like about this book: Scott's way of describing places and people namely the party at Gatsby's early on.Since this is a book you're forced to read in high school I don't need to explain the plot because if your're reading this review, chances are you already know what's up. Class consciousness and questions of status and the very social sphere these people created and exist were more interesting to me than Gaisy. Not that I didn't enjoy the drama and the romance aspect, I did. Very much. I thought it all worked with the above quite nicely and that relationship had a lot to say about the answers to those questions of cultural superficiality or the acquisition of wealth. (Aha, I did pay attention in 1st period!) Needless to say Great Gatsby has quickly become a favorite, although The Beautiful and Damned out classes Gatsby as my favorite F. Scott novel. Something I complained about in 2006 was that it wasn't ""flappery"" enough. I wanted Chicago. I wanted bathtub-gin and more debauched 1920s Jazz Age (sterotypical) imagery. Obviously 'all that jazz' does factor in here since, you know, it was the times but its not the point. Which is seeing how and why people do what they do to impress other people higher up in their sphere of influence; how that plays out either in romantic relationships or in the world you've created and deal with. Forcing people to read literature is never a good idea. But when the day comes that said student grows up a bit they will see the greatness of the literature that their teacher was trying to ram down their throats but couldn't understand at the time. This is what happened to me June 2012."
247,Hburger,"Simply overall BRILLIANT. I felt it hard to move past the first few pages, but after them till about two thirds through the book, I simply could not put it down. Read the whole thing in about 5 hours. The last 20 or so pages were a little confusing, but hey, that's what researching and discussing with friends is for :3"
248,Holly,"I first read this book a number of years ago. I liked it but quickly forgot it. After being captivated all over again by Baz Luhrmann’s recent film extravaganza, I decided to re-read it - and this time, immerse myself in it. I adore this novel! Fitzgerald’s writing is precise and tantalizing - the opulence and excess of the roaring twenties is so beautifully and meticulously encapsulated in every phrase. Every one of Fitzgerald’s characters is so vivid and memorable. Typically gentle and typically honest narrator Nick Carraway tries his best not to judge the “careless people” he rubs shoulders with upon his move to the West Egg, Long Island. He is surprisingly quick to move amongst the most elite New York circles, and it’s not long before he begins a friendship with the elusive titular character, Mr Gatsby himself.Wealthy and spontaneous airhead Daisy Buchanan sighs her way into your affections, with her pitifully high levels of naivety, delicacy and ignorance. Described by Fitzgerald as having a face that is “sad and lovely with bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth”, Daisy epitomises a Marilyn Monroe-esque screen siren. In my humble opinion, she also conjures up strong similarities to Blanche Dubois - another great literary female character from the Tennessee William’s classic A Streetcar Named Desire. On the other end of the scale, is Daisy’s womanizing, brute of a husband Tom Buchanan. The dominating sportsman is “a sturdy, straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner”. Tom considers himself too important to blend in; effortlessly bombarding nearly every chapter he appears in. Buchanan is a walking contradiction. He exercises some serious restraint when it comes to Daisy’s relationships, yet grants himself free reign to take up with other women (one in particular). Even glamorous motor mouth and professional golfer Jordan Baker and Tom Buchanan’s flirty and voluptuous mistress Myrtle Wilson have stunningly developed and exciting personalities. Baker is a “slender, small-breasted girl” of immense beauty but has the irritating tendency to tell a tall tale when it comes to accentuating juicy gossip and facts. The latter, Wilson, is married to a dopey car-mechanic (George Wilson), but has become accustomed to the more expensive lifestyle her boyfriend Buchanan provides when they rendezvous uptown. Her spontaneity, however, is dangerous and will become a factor in her untimely and dramatic death. The enigmatic and hopeful titular character may be a man of expensive taste, but Jay Gatsby channels all of his wealth and possessions into winning back the lost love of his life - Daisy. So, he’s rather romantic and we like him for that. Described in a single sentence as an “elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty” with impeccable etiquette and a penchant for affectionately calling everyone “old sport”, Gatsby oozes style and mystery. His relentless pursuit of the love of his life is commendable, but the rumour mill is rife with reports he may have dappled in corruption and dishonesty to do so. Overall, Fitzgerald paints a rather beautifully fractured picture of 1920s Long Island - a town overrun by fast money and even faster cars. Carraway does a good job at being our guide and narrator, remaining fairly coherent amongst the boobs and booze. There is no doubt why this novella is such a timeless classic and it deserves to be revisited and read over and over again. The descriptions are utter perfection, and this “great American novel"" is riddled with quote worthy phrases and motto’s.So grab a copy, old sport, and immerse yourself in Gatsby’s world! "
249,Katie Bliss,"After rereading this for book club (and in preparation for the movie coming out in May), I was struck that truly awesome literature just gets better and better each time you read it again. I love this book! It's an awesome revealing of human nature: wanting to love and be loved, wanting power and control, and when the realization comes that we are not in control, this can devastate and destroy. This book is just too rich to be able to go into all the ways it is true, and disturbing."
250,Shelli,"Fitzgerald's writing is remarkable. I'd missed his talent when I read this in high school ... I didn't even like it back then. I understand that it's a commentary on the chasm between rich and poor, and how silly people with money could be. But really I was just blown away and completely preoccupied by his poetic prose. I marked so many passages - some that made me gasp (how did he even BEGIN writing a sentence that perfect??) or laugh, even a couple that brough tears to my eyes. I think it's a little bit of a stretch for me to join the voices proclaiming this as the best American novel of the 20th century, but it was definitely a pleasure to read, and one I will revisit often. Now I want to go read every book he's ever written."
251,Deborah Markus,"The first time I read this, I was young and impatient. (Now I'm old and impatient.) I didn't understand Fitzgerald's genius until page 162 (which is pretty close to the end, which shows how hard I can be to be convinced of the obvious). It's a passage you probably know well if you're familiar with the book:""...he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about...""I understood almost nothing of the rest of the book. The problems and petty tragedies of the privileged moved me very little (and I don't care much more about them now). Even Nick Carraway, the quiet narrator who barely leaves a trace of himself in the story, was much more secure in every sense than I'd ever been and so seemed far above and beyond me. And that period of American history left, and leaves, me cold.So what could this story possibly hold for me?That's what I keep coming back to find out. It began with having faith in a writer who understood how terrifying a rose can be from a certain angle. It's a little more personal now that I have a son who suffers from Carraway Syndrome: the condition of being a quiet, sympathetic, nonjudgmental presence who attracts people who desperately need that. He's a ""good listener"" in a world that rarely returns the favor.What will the story be for me next time? A closer look at Jordan Baker, maybe. Or a better understanding of Nick and his fear of ""missing something if I forget that...a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth."" Or maybe I'll just listen, the way Nick was compelled to listen both to ""veteran bores"" and ""the secret griefs of wild, unknown men."" And if I'm still not sure why I should care about Gatsby and his cherished heartbreak, there's always another reading ahead. Because whatever else this is, it's not a story that can be shut, set aside, and forgotten. Even I figured that out the first time around, and I was an exceptionally stupid teenage reader."
252,Selina,"Nick, the narrator of the book, tells the story of the summer he met Mr. Gatsby. A story not only of grandeur and scandal, but of fading ideals and hypocrisy. (view spoiler)[ Gatsby, who at first seemed like this untouchable being that was rich, popular, gracefully, and proper, turned out to be passionate and lively. He was someone who worked hard to change himself from a penniless nobody into a cool, wealthy person of status in order to win back the heart of his love Daisy, who had married someone else while Gatsby was away at war. (hide spoiler)] A tangled web is weaved by Gatsby, Daisy, and Tom in this book, and it gets more and more tangled until nearly every one becomes a casualty one way or another.I really had no expectations coming into the book since I had done a great job avoiding any spoilers or hints as to what the story was about. I thought the narration by Nick was perfect as he was the cool-headed, reasonable bystander seeing all these events unfold before him.""Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.""By the end of the novel, we realize how true Nick's own words about himself are as the real natures and histories of Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, Jordan, and even some of the more minor characters are revealed to us - good and bad.I honestly expected this book to be difficult to read since it was written a while ago and took place during the 1920s. However, I was surprised to find how easy it was to breeze through. I found myself not able to stop reading as the mystique surrounding Mr. Gatsby and the love affairs between the characters kept me very interested. The moment when Tom realized the truth, I just knew something exciting and terrible was going to happen."
253,Sherri Rabinowitz,"This has always been one of my favorite novels. It's funny but I didn't remember how short it was. It is a haunting tale that is full of magic and wonder. There is a line at the end of the novel that describes it perfectly.""I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it.""Isn't that haunting and beautiful. The way he can paint a picture with his words is just amazing. I love the era, the rush and excitement of '20's it must have been exciting. It must have just swept you up in its rush toward the ocean of life. The way he captures that is one of the reasons I can go back to read it over and over again.I also find it intriguing that one of the most modern woman of literature at that time was captured in his novel. Jordan Baker, she was a flawed woman but she was a working woman who made who her own life and career through her talent. She was a woman of her time and yet in so many ways she was ahead of her time. They say the '20's created the society we now live in and as you read about Jordan you see that clearly.I think that this book is timeless magic and that it is very hard to capture that on film. It is one of the reasons they keep trying to remake it. You can't capture magic in a bottle."
254,Janine Kelly,"When I heard we were to be reading The Great Gatsby for our exam I was inexplicably excited; I had no idea at all what it was about and was just going off the amount of praise I'd heared heaped upon it.The first time I read the novel I struggled to fully appreciate the symbolism and allegorical significance of it and was mostly intrigued by the character of Gatsby and is fufilling of his dream. I was able however to realise the contextual significance of the novel as a representation of the Jazz Age and 1920s American society, consumed by the wealth and hedonism of the ""lost generation"", perfectly presented through the over the top grandeur of Gatsby's parties and the actions of those in attendance. Upon my second reading of the book I truly fell in love with the story and its likeness to the story of America and the American Dream. Fitzgerald's comparison of Gatsby to America, always seeking to turn back time and relive a dream already ""behind him"" ""where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night"". The tragic end to the book, of Gatsby ultimately being let down by the unworthy object of his desire, Daisy (who is unable to fufill such a dream) and having to look upon ""an unfamiliar sky"", is one which leaves me with a great sadness everytime I read it.I, myself, in the end felt at one with the narrator, Nick Carraway, in his belief of Gatsby's dream of ""the green light"" and his view, and that of Fitzgerald's, of Gatsby as a great American hero despite his flaws. A fantastic American novel and one I would recommend."

256,Amanda Trevino,this book was very good! it kept my attention more than 95% of the time. a must read classic!!
257,Ivana Komendic,"This book is amazing, it is truly a must read classic! F .Scott Fitzgerald created a very believable plot, and characters, all characters stay true to themselves as we the readers find out at the end of the novel. He wrote the book in such a way that we didn't even notice that the chances of this 'high class' lifestyle and storyline had very low chnaces of being viewed as realistic, but it was delievered and enchantned by the author himself, he blends it all so perfectly that we grow attached to the characters and find ourselves (myself rather) not wanting to put the book down. I believe that so many people enjoy this novel because the outcome is realistic, and even if perchance it is not, F .Scott Fitzgerald made us believe that there was really only one ending to this book."
258,Jasmine,"Ok, so I saw the film first; however, that has in no way altered my love of this book. I am afraid that had I not seen the film first, then I may have never read the book. It’s one of those stories that I feel must be read. The characters are lively and in need of adventure in their wealthy lives. After meeting Gatsby for the first time, we immediately need to know the reasoning behind these wondrous parties of his, but all in due course, for all does become clear. I got pulled in to the world of the rich and extravagant lives of the people of 1920s New York; pulled into the wild parties, escaping into a now extinct world of money and prohibition. With the mysterious character of Jay Gatsby, how could I not read to the very end, discovering just who this man was and what made him be that person. I was captivated. We learn of what he loves and what keeps him living. All seen from the eyes of his neighbour, Nick Carraway, we are shown of how life once was for those prosperous few, and how it can all go astray, and all in just one summer.The writing style is beautiful and definitely of its age, but all I can think is that this is part of its charm that really draws me into the time period. It’s a small book with a big story to tell, and I can’t recommend it enough. It’s a classic, and, I’ll say it again: a must read!"
259,Curt Hopkins Hopkins,"One of the greatest books I've ever read. If you haven't read it, it's completely different than what you think it would be - no matter what you think. It feels like Important Art but without an ounce of signifying ornament. The story is true, in other words. And the atmosphere rings like a bell for days with the final few pages. Jesus. Seriously. Great indeed. I wish I could remember that Catullus line about long books.***Two lady British classicists, Cambridge's Mary Beard, who writes for the Times of London, and Oxford's Charlotte Higgins, who writes for the Guardian, were both good enough to correct me. It's not the 1st century B.C. Roman poet Catullus, but rather the 3rd century B.C. Greek poet Callimachus who said ""μεγα βιβλιον, μεγα κακον,"" or ""mega biblion, mega kakon,"" which I translated as ""big book, big shit"" but literally means, ""big book, big bad."" Because of the kakon/caca connection (in my mind) I read it as shit. Higgins said, ""big book, a load of shit"" which I like. Follow these brainiacs on twitter @wmarybeard and @chiggi.Well, the point, at any rate, was that these days we get ""literary novelists"" churning out thousand-word turds. Gatsby was 180 pages and did not need one more damned page. I have become the ineffectual proponent of limiting books of poetry to 20 pages and novels to 200. "
260,Lauren Tomlinson,"This is one of my very favorite books. I'm glad that I got some time to read it again for the 5th time. If you have not yet read this book, you definitely should."
261,Ash,"I chose 'The Great Gatsby' by F. Scott Fitzgerald, because of all the hype around it, and I want to see the upcoming movie, but I thought I should read it first. The Great Gatsby is about a young man named Nick Carraway who rents a estate next to this famous man named Gatsby. Turns out Gatsby is famous for his amazing parties, and Nick gets invited to one of them, after that his life becomes quite interesting. My favorite quote from this book is “I hope she'll be a fool, that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.” I chose this quote because I think it there's some truth to it, a fool is dumb oblivious, and easy to manipulate, maybe Nick wants that, he likes girls who are dumb and easy to take advantage of. I think F. Scott Fitzgerald's style is very calm and eloquent, he has a very chill way of writing, which makes you feel like someone out of Mad Men. I would recommend this book to anyone look for a really nice story about the 1920's and something classy for a change."
262,Anas Almansuri,"What kind of review i can write about this masterpiece?! i guess I'm out of words, the only thing i can say is ""Classics will always blow my mind!""."
263,Loren,"I recently read Gatsby again. I was only thirteen the first time and now I am twenty-nine. I felt it was a due a good dusting. It was quite a bore the first round as required reading. ""Why would I care about a bunch of rich people being superfluously supercilious and capricious!"" I declared to my teacher who chuckled about my word choice. I tended to be succinctly garrulous when pressured at that age. I blame mother who falls back on her intelligent and cultured breeding to defend her unfortunate poverty. Oh how things change and yet stay the same! And that's how I still feel about the Great Gatsby. Yes it is a masterpiece, but I sneer at Max Perkins and his fluidity. His well edited words of Fitz only further the divide of the classes and cement the glass ceiling of American high society. It is so perfectly sculpted that I find myself a little nauseated all the same. You can literally see Daisy, see Buchanan, you can see Jay Gatz. And the world still has them, wrecking havoc and throwing money at their problems. Swine before pearls, I say! Damn them! Damn them all!"
264,Lynn,"I always find something new to admire in this novel each time I read it. Almost every sentence is a revelation. Some of the sentences I can stop and think about for a long time. I'm teaching it in my Novel Writing class, and some of my students don't love it, which makes me sad. I don't think it is an inaccessible book, but I do think it takes some concentration to wrestle all the meaning from each sentence. If there is anyone who hasn't read it, you should!"
265,Daniel Villines,"At face value, I see this book as a somewhat cheesy love story involving a bunch of rich people. It’s a book filled with elaborate parties, elaborate homes, and elaborate things. Throw in the story of Tom Buchanan's love triangle and this book becomes deserving of a shirtless Fabio, blazing his embrace across the cover of a paperback that will soon be pulped.But look closer, as the gigantic blue eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg urge the reader to do, and you’ll see that this is a book about life, about people, and how people move through life in response to two primary and opposite forces that define our every action: reason and passion. The paper-thin Harlequin Romance cover becomes transparent and the characters transform themselves into the best and worst parts of us all. The Great Gatsby is a book filled with characters that reason, characters that reason incorrectly, and characters that are consumed by passion.But why is The Great Gatsby often referred to as the “Great American Novel”? Yes, there is a rags-to-riches element of the story and the setting captures the life-styles of a range of classes, but other books do these same things and do them to a much greater level of success.So, I’m left with the rationalization that America, as echoed in the pages of this book, posses a wanting of Nick’s; contains a vast number of Wilson’s and Buchanan’s; has a spattering of Jordan Baker’s who entertain us even though their feats may be comprised of illusions. And occasionally there is a Gatsby; someone who’s destiny was corrupted by his passion, which may indeed speak to the very nature of the American Dream."
266,George Gutowski,The iconic American novel has survived yet another Hollywood onslaught. The timeliness of the message remains. People with money get away with just about anything including murder. But you didn't need to read the book to know that. To my way of thinking the book is a lament for the American Soul. Young man from very poor circumstances builds himself up. A world war throws him a curve ball.He suddenly realizes he needs much money to attract the vapid dream he had fallen in love with. He gets it through gangster activities and then goes after his dream.Dream girl becomes confused. She married boorish money and can now upgrade to more stylish money circumstances.Then the prize becomes corrupt. Or should we say the corruptness of the prize comes to the surface. Gatsby is so anchored to his dream he tries to play the cards out and cover over the corruptness.But the dream turns on Gatsby and consumes him. The rich ride off. You see they seem to be able to smash up things and just leave without a worry.Money and privilege have not changed much. Different generations and different cultures come and go. But when the privilege is assumed and there are no responsibilities it falls apart. Rich classes implode. Welfare classes collapse. It's all the same. We just need a damn good reminder once in a while. 
267,Lyne,"The Great Gatsby by Scott Fitzgerald is a fiction drama adult novel about the scandalous lives of New York's elite. The story consists of the main character, Nick Carraway, who is a young Yale-educated man from Minnesota who goes to New York city to learn more about the business industry. After moving to West Egg, a fictional area of Long Island that is home to the newly rich, Nick quickly befriends his next-door neighbour, the mysterious Jay Gatsby. Mr.Gatsby constantly throws killer parties, yet nobody knows why. Throughout his living in the city, Nick gets to know his cousin, Daisy's, husband Tom. Getting closer and closer to Gatsby, Nick encounters the fact that Gatsby and Daisy were once in-love before he left for war, yet when he came back, he had found out that she married Tom. He is still in-love with her, and (spoiler alert) actually throws all of these thousand-dollar parties with hope that one day she will attend one of the parties. Gatsby begs Nick to arrange a meeting for he and Daisy, and top agrees. After seeing eachother again, Daisy regains her love for Gatsby and begins having an affair with him. By spending more and more time with the upper-class, Nick comes to find out that Tom has a mistress too, Merdith, who is also married. Tom begins getting suspicious and investigates Daisy's life, to find out that she is in love with Gatsby. Through scandalous adventures and horrifying moments, one of the main characters ends up being killed.I love this book because it has a great theme to it, which is the death of the American Dream. Nick mentions towards the end of the book that as the main character's life and dream of love was corrupted by money and dishonesty, the American dream of happiness and individualism has shattered into the scanty pursuit of wealth, which I think definitely makes the readers think deeply about it, even after they've read the book.I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone, but it's vocabulary is slightly advanced, therefore if you're english level isn't that advanced, maybe have a dictionary or word-defining tool next to you while reading, Overall, I loved this book and think that it's one of a kind, which is probably why it is a classic."
268,Lucy,"Even though I originally read this in high school and had the expected indoctrination of this-is-why-this-book-is-so-great, my fifteen year-old self still thought it was great. After re-reading it this week, my 37 year-old self loves it even more. I wanted to read it again before I saw the new Baz Luhrman movie adaptation but didn't get around to it. I was surprised when I didn't adore the movie. I thought the marriage of a great book and Luhrman's decadent style would be perfect for me. I liked it well enough (I've loved his other movies: Moulin Rouge and Romeo and Juliet) and really enjoyed the mash-up of an updated soundtrack with the elaborate time period costuming but there was something irritating about it all. I thought it was Leo DiCaprio's acting but after finishing the book, I don't think that's it. Instead, to my surprise, I think the movie overdid all of the parties in the beginning. Not that the parties weren't accurately portrayed and the indulgence and depravity present as described by Fitzgerald but the book was able to describe the parties and mention their frequency without having to place the reader in the tiring environment for long. Because, the book isn't only about the shallow excess of the era. It is about a great obsession. While I read, I realized how closely the dialogue of the movie matched the book but subtle descriptive words and Fitzgerald's absolute masterful grasp of phrasing was able to soften my judgment of all these ridiculous people and allow the tragedy of misplaced ambition to touch me. This absolutely has a place in America's classrooms and deserves its label of The Great American Novel. I loved it. "
269,Luce,"Jay Gatsby is the single most hopeful person I know. Seriously. You're super rich neighbour is actually a criminal in love with the girl across his bay. simple? Well she's married, so Jay gets you to invite her around and then booooom! Mr Gatsby is in his element. He has a love for Daisy I have never come across in literature before, passionate and somewhat forceful to get her to confess to her husband she is actually in love with Gatsby. This book is truly original and a must read. Fitzgerald brings all the hope in the world to this man, and Gatsby truly is Great."
270,Deanna Sletten,"I love every book and short story F. Scott Fitzgerald ever wrote and of course The Great Gatsby is one of my all-time favorites. Fitzgerald saw the irony if everything and wasn't afraid to make fun of people who, in his time, would have been revered. Even though he was a part of the rich, party scene in his real life, he found humor in how silly and pretensious everyone was. He shows this in The Great Gatsby with his sprinkling of humor. Although I think Daisy is an air-headed idiot - I think Fitzgerald meant her to be. This book is a wonderful reflection of its time - everyone should read it at least once!"
271,Luca,"LETTO IN EDIZIONE La biblioteca di Repubblica con introduzione di Alessandro Piperno e traduzione di Fernanda Pivano______________________________________________________________________________________________________Così continuiamo a remare, barche contro corrente, risospinti senza posa nel passato.Parlò molto del passato, e ne dedussi che cercava di ritrovare qualcosa, forse un concetto di se stesso che era scomparso nell’amore per Daisy. Da allora la sua vita era stata confusa e disordinata; ma se poteva ritornare a un certo punto di partenza e ricominciare lentamente tutto da capo, sarebbe riuscito a scoprire qual era la cosa che cercava……una notte d’autunno, cinque anni prima, avevano passeggiato lungo una strada. Cadevano le foglie. Erano giunti a un luogo dove non c’erano alberi e il marciapiede era bianco sotto il chiaro di luna. Qui si erano fermati, e si erano voltati l’uno verso l’altra. Era una notte fresca; c’era quell’esaltazione misteriosa che viene durante i due cambiamenti di stagione dell’anno. Le luci tranquille delle case ronzavano nell’oscurità; c’era un fruscio e un bisbiglio tra le stelle. Con la coda dell’occhio, Gatsby vedeva che gli edifici sui marciapiedi costituivano una vera e propria scala e salivano a un luogo segreto al disopra degli alberi; poteva arrampicarvisi e, se lo faceva da solo, una volta in cima avrebbe potuto succhiare la linfa della vita, trangugiare il latte incomparabile della meraviglia.Il cuore gli batteva sempre più in fretta mentre il viso bianco di Daisy si accostava al suo. Sapeva che baciando quella ragazza, incatenando per sempre le proprie visioni inesprimibili all’alito perituro di lei, la sua mente non avrebbe più spaziato come la mente di Dio. Così aspettò, ascoltando ancora un momento il diapason battuto su una stella. Poi la baciò. Sotto il tocco delle sue labbra Daisy sbocciò per lui come un fiore, e l’incarnazione fu completa.In tutto quello che mi disse, perfino nel suo sentimentalismoimpressionante, ritrovai qualcosa: un ritmo sfuggente, un frammento di parole perdute, che avevo udito da qualche parte molto tempo prima. Per un momento una frase cercò di prender forma nella mia bocca, e le labbra si schiusero come quelle di un muto, come se non fossero trattenute soltanto da un filo di aria stupita. Ma non diedero suono, e ciò che avevo quasi ritrovato divenne inesprimibile per sempre.Concentrarsi su una singola interpretazione de Il grande Gatsby sarebbe fuorviante, eppure l’immagine di questo strambo riccone è spesso rinchiusa in un alone non troppo mistico definito dallo sperpero dei festeggiamenti parossistici. Niente di più lontano, di più superficiale come ben sa chi ha letto il libro e non si è fermato alla notizia della sua fama. Lo stesso appellativo associato a Gatsby nel titolo, cade in una sorta di ambiguità. Grande. Il grande Gatsby. È un termine descrittivo, che si riferisce alle sue ricchezze e alle gesta da self-made man che lo portarono ad ottenerle o piuttosto siamo nel campo dell’ironia che vuole presentarci un uomo alla ricerca di una grandezza che dalle affollate feste lo porterà a morire quasi solo? Ancora, forse, possiamo trovare il significato di quell’aggettivo nelle dimensioni epiche dei sogni di un piccolo uomo e dei suoi sforzi per realizzarli o nell’immensità dell’amore provato che rende vani tali sforzi? The Great Gatsby (e scelgo qui l’inglese che mi impone il maiuscolo della prima G) è questo e tanto altro, un romanzo stratificato reso omogeneo da una scrittura limpida, critica, intelligente, perspicace.Questa pluralità di temi, ad ogni modo, non ci impedisce di riconoscere un tema portante che riconduce facilmente alla vita e alle tribolazioni dell’autore: la fallibilità del mito americano e il rapporto con il successo e la nobiltà. Il desiderio di coronare l’amore per Daisy, diviene così la ricerca fallita, irrealizzabile, di innalzarsi al di sopra delle proprie umili origini, di compiere il sogno americano che mostra il suo vero volto crudele di traditore. Un sogno circondato di ceneri e di falsi dei («Dio vede tutto» ripeté Wilson. «È un cartellone pubblicitario» lo rassicurò Michaelis.) come quelli che si svelano agli occhi adulti («Ho trent’anni» dissi. «Ho cinque anni di troppo per mentire a me stesso e chiamarlo onore.») del protagonista che si rende conto di come quella che ha vissuto non è stata altro che una storia del West, e ci fa capire come quella che abbiamo letto non è solo la storia del grande Gatsby."
272,Ivan,"Esta crítica puedes encontrarla en: http://www.elblogdeivanrumar.com/2014...De sueños rotos y gente desconsideradaComo viene ocurriéndome desde hace un tiempo, los clásicos suelen ser una fuente de temas y reflexiones muy ricas; ahí están lecturas tan recomendables como ""La metamorfosis"", ""El viejo y el mar"" o ""El guardián entre el centeno"". Son lecturas muy interesantes y ""El gran Gatsby"" no ha sido una excepción. Nick Carraway viaja a Nueva York con el objetivo de empezar una nueva vida como agente de bolsa. Se instala en una modesta casa situada en el West Egg, una zona rica donde vive la clase alta neoyorquina. Allí se reencontrará con su prima Daisy, que está casada con el autoritario Tom Buchanan, y con un caballero misterioso, Jay Gatsby. De la mano de estos y otros personajes, Nick se irá adentrando cada vez más en el mundillo de la frívola clase alta que poblaba los años previos al crack del 29 y profundizando en la compleja relación que se establece entre Daisy y Gatsby.Es cierto que el argumento es algo simple, e incluso algo manido con toda la experiencia fílmica y literaria que hemos adquirido a lo largo de tantos años, pero es en el tratamiento de ciertos temas donde ""El gran Gatsby"" se revela como una excelente obra.¿Quién no se ha sentido engañado y manipulado por alguien que se dedica a jugar con los sentimientos de los demás? La relación entre Gatsby y Daisy no es otra cosa que una relación condenada por dos maneras diferentes de entender el amor. Gatsby es un soñador, un romántico que no sabe, o no quiere, ver más allá de la imagen mental que se ha creado de la chica perfecta. Una persona que cree que con dedicación podrá cambiar al otro y transformarlo en su ideal. Daisy, esa clase de animal capaz de destruir los sentimientos de los demás con su desconsideración y su poca capacidad para ponerse en la piel de los demás. En realidad, una persona débil incapaz de renunciar a los placeres que le aporta la vida con Tom, aun cuando él la maltrata y la ningunea, y que a la vez se siente muy cómoda en su papel de víctima. Un pasaje tomado de la narración de Nick dice lo siguiente:""Todo era pura desconsideración y puro desorden. Tom y Daisy eran criaturas desconsideradas: hacían añicos cosas y personas y luego volvían a su dinero o a su enorme desconsideración, o a lo que fuese que los mantenía unidos, y dejaban que otros se encargaran de limpiar lo que ellos ensuciaban""¿Y qué pasa cuando tus sueños se truncan? ¿Qué ocurre cuando te das cuenta que no han sido más que humo y autoengaño? Es terrible cuando alguien se da de bruces contra la cruda realidad y Gatsby, que había construido toda su vida alrededor de su sueño de vivir con Daisy y que luego tiene que ver cómo ella vuelve con Tom, es un buen ejemplo de ello; la escena final con el mecánico es muy poderosa. Además, los sueños rotos de Gatsby funcionan muy bien como una metáfora de una sociedad que estaba a punto de vivir uno de sus mayores batacazos: el crack del 29.Desde un aspecto puramente literario, el narrador secundario es una opción muy acertada para contarnos la historia; Nick se mantiene, en la medida de lo posible, al margen de los hechos y eso le dota de un punto de vista libre de cualquier influencia. Es cierto que a medida que los hechos se van precipitando se va decantando por Gatsby, pero durante el inicio y el nudo se mantiene imparcial y se limita a narrar los hechos para que cada uno pueda sacar sus conclusiones y atar cabos. Pero no solo Nick está bien en la novela; los personajes están muy bien perfilados y cada uno tiene un cometido concreto en la novela.Si queréis reflexionar sobre diferentes maneras de entender el amor, los ideales y los sueños, entre otras muchas cosas, ""El gran Gatsby"" es una obra tremendamente recomendable. Se lee muy bien y los personajes están trabajados. Muy recomendable.9/10"
273,Zach Ullian,My reaction to reading this book was that I was very entertained most of the novel but when I found out the truth of what was happening it made me sad. I realized that Gatsby had a very sad and lonely life and as a reader I felt sorry for him. I would definitely recommend this book to a friend because it was very well written and it transitioned nicely from scene to scene. I would also recommend seeing the movie after reading the book because the movie was almost identical to the book and it was what I portrayed the book to be like in my mind. The Great Gatsby was narrated in first person and I think this was a good idea by the author because the narrator was a protagonist whose consciousness filters the story's events. I think that society would have a similar reaction to mine when they read this book because it was a very entertaining book until the narrator finds out the truth of Gatsby and then the book gets sad. I think the intended audience would be 10th grade or older because it might be harder for younger students to understand the concept of the book. Overall I rate this book 9/10
274,Paige,"Oh, Gatsby, you beautiful little fool. This is a book that I do not think I will ever tire of- as soon as I finished I wished to go back to page one and start all over again.This was one of the books that I watched before I read- and my God, was the film excellent. Leonardo was a fine Jay Gatsby, something I can now confirm thoroughly after having read the book. I can also say the same for Nick Carraway, and Jordan Baker, and well, everyone really. It really helped me visualise the novel, since I could put faces to names.It was, however, a little irritating since I could not stop reading the book in their voices. Which is fine, except hearing Spiderman narrate the life of Jimmy Gatz is not exactly how I anticipated this novel to go.But now, onto the novel. I was expecting it to be longer, you know? My teacher was like ""Soandso finished it in a day."" But it was 180 pages long! That's, what, one and a half, two hours reading? So, yeah, easily attainable in a day- one sitting, even.For some reason, all my favourite books tend to be short in length, and I have no idea why. Maybe its because of how effective the message is when it is- not condensed, but, well, concentrated I suppose is the right word. There's no elaborateness to the plot, nothing that makes it feel like dead weight in my hands. (I have nothing against long novels, absolutely nothing at all).I'm saying that The Great Gatsby is a favourite book because really, it is. It's wonderful.Set in the 1920's, this book is a whole jump away from modern times. I know a little about the 1920's, since my History class covered it, but that's not to say that what I read wasn't shocking, because it was. Not shocking in a bad way, but just, really surprising. It is so different, it's almost maddening, because it is almost the same. Minus the advance in technology, it is pretty much no different at all to modern day living, in my opinion.Nick Carraway, the protagonist, is exceptionally ordinary. He isn't rich, he just so happens to be friends with the rich. Which, of course, acts as a gateway for him into the world of the higher society. Then there's Jay Gatsby, whom much of the novel centres around.A charming young man, who throws lavish parties and spends the whole time out of the limelight, who is deeply infatuated with Nick's cousin, Daisy. He's also Nick's neighbour, and, eventually, his friend. Best friend, probably, as I can't imagine either of those people have many friends.It's not because they're bad people- I do not think anyone in this book is bad. I think many are inherently selfish, but not necessarily bad. Daisy and Tom are selfish- so selfish, in fact, that they are blinded by it. They do not even see the wider scope of things.Jay Gatsby is selfish. He is caught in the past, where he has become his own demon; haunted by what he once had, forever caged in the world he imagined for himself those many years ago. It's plausible that this is an onset of the war, caused by grief and his own version of PTSD.But then again, it's plausible that Jay Gatsby has become so disillusioned by his way of life, by the character that he has become and the world he has adopted, that he no longer knows what is real and what is happening before him. Like I said, it doesn't make him a bad person. He's not completely good, but I don't believe he is bad.I think Fitzgerald was trying to send a pretty obvious message about history, and the past, with this piece. One of the most famous quotes from this novel is quite possibly: ""[You can't repeat the past] Why, of course you can."" I'm not saying this is the message- well, I suppose, in a way, I am.Obviously, what has happened once can happen again, and events are no exception. (Unless they're something like the holocaust. I am a firm believer that no one in the world will allow something as undeniably horrific as that to occur again).But they will never happen in exactly the same way. Gatsby states that he is going to fix things to exactly the way they were before- which is impossible, and he should know better.Over all, this book is full of wonder and provides a fantastic introspection of the way the rich and the not so rich lived their life. It is not pretentious in any way, and highlights just how mad the world can seem when one man is stuck in the past, and how it can result in quite possibly the worst mistake of his life.--For more reviews like this, visit my blog:http://thebookcarousel.blogspot.co.uk"
275,Luci,"I often let a lot of time go by between reads of this and I always think I am building it up in my mind to be better than it really is. Nope, it's just as good as I remember it being."
276,Nataliya,"Oh Gatsby, you old sport, you poor semi-delusionally hopeful dreamer with 'some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life', focusing your whole self and soul on that elusive money-colored green light - a dream that shatters just when you are *this* close to it. Jay Gatsby, who dreamed a dream with the passion and courage few possess - and the tragedy was that it was a wrong dream colliding with reality that was even more wrong - and deadly. Just like the Great Houdini - the association the title of this book so easily invokes - you specialized in illusions and escape. Except even the power of most courageous dreamers can be quite helpless to allow us escape the world, our past, and ourselves, giving rise to one of the most famous closing lines of a novel.
'Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter — to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning —— So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.'
Dear Gatsby, not everything I liked back when I was fourteen has withstood the test of time¹ - but you clearly did, and as I get older, closer to your and Nick Carraway's age, your story gathers more dimensions and more tragedy, fleshing out so much more from what I thought of as a tragic love story when I was a child - turning into a great American tragedy.¹ I hang my head in shame at my ability to still belt out an enthusiastic (albeit poorly rendered) version of '...Baby One More Time' when it comes on the radio (provided, of course, that my car windows are safely up).I blame it on my residual teenage hormones.Jay Gatsby, you barged head-on to achieve and conquer your American dream, not stopping until your dreams became your reality, until you reinvented yourself with the dizzying strength of your belief. Your tragedy was that you equated your dream with money, and money with happiness and love. And honestly, given the messed up world we live in, you were not that far from getting everything you thought you wanted, including the kind of love that hinges on the green dollar signs. And you *almost* saw it, you poor bastard, but in the end you chose to let your delusion continue, you poor soul.Poor Gatsby! Yours is the story of a young man who suddenly rose to wealth and fame, running like a hamster on the wheel amassing wealth for the sake of love, for the sake of winning the heart of a Southern belle, the one whose 
'voice is full of money'
 - in a book written by a young man who suddenly rose to wealth and fame, desperately running on the hamster wheel of 'high life' to win the heart of his own Southern belle. Poor Gatsby, and poor F. Scott Fitzgerald - the guy who so brilliantly described it all, but who continued to live the life his character failed to see for what it was.The Great Gatsby is a story about the lavish excesses meant to serve every little whim of the rich and wannabe-rich in the splendid but unsatisfying in their shallow emptiness glitzy and gaudy post-war years, and the resulting suffocation under the uselessness and unexpected oppressiveness of elusive American dream in the time when money was plenty and the alluring seemingly dream life was just around the corner, just within reach.But first and foremost, it is a story of disillusionment with dreams that prove to be shallow and unworthy of the dreamer - while at the same time firmly hanging on to the idea of the dream, the ability to dream big, and the stubborn tenacity of the dreamer, 
'an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again'
.This is why Gatsby is still so relevant in the world we live in - almost a hundred years after Fitzgerald wrote it in the Roaring Twenties - the present-day world that still worships money and views it as a substitute for the American dream, the world that hinges on materialism, the world that no longer frowns on the gaudiness and glitz of the nouveau riche. In this world Jay Gatsby, poor old sport, with his huge tasteless mansion and lavish tasteless parties and in-your-face tasteless car and tasteless pink suit would be, perhaps, quietly sniggered at - but would have fit in without the need for aristocratic breeding - who cares if he has the money and the ability to throw parties worthy of reality show fame??? Because in the present world just the fact of having heaps of money makes you worthy - and therefore the people whose 'voices are full of money', who are 'gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor', people who genuinely believe that money makes them worthy and invincible are all too common. Tom and Daisy Buchanan would be proud of them. And wannabe Gatsbys pour their capacity to dream into chasing the shallow dream of dollar signs, nothing more.
'They were careless people, Tom and Daisy — they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.'
This book somehow hit the right note back when I read it when I was fourteen, and hit even truer note now, deeply resonating with me a decade short of a hundred years since it was written. If you read it for school years ago, I ask you to pick it up and give its pages another look - and it may amaze you. Five green-light stars in the fog at the end of a dock."
277,Dorlana,"I tend to put books in three different categories: I can’t wait to see how it ends, Can’t… read… another… word and Journey reads. The Great Gatsby was a Journey read; one where the ending didn’t matter as much as the wonderful words that got me there. Of course this classic has been reviewed forever, so I think I will just quote a few of my favorite lines. “And I like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”“Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.” “Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?”“But there was Jordon beside me, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age.” “I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child.”"
278,Lilly Minasyan,"Spoiler:This book was one of those books that I wanted to read for a long time. I remember I started to read it 2 years ago and was not into it at all. So I just stopped reading it.This time I was determined to finish it, even if It took me weeks. In the beginning I was not into it. I thought to myself that this will be one dreadful book. Then around page 78-80... I was hooked. I could not put this book away. I think I started to like Gatsby (the main character) when he bought a dress for a girl who teared her dress in one of his parties. Then how shy he was to ask someone for a favor. Being rich and not feeling that he is entitled to anything, makes his character more charismatic. The way he loved the girl, Daisy (who was married and in my opinion who did not love Jay Gatsby at all). When they met for the first time after they parted 5 years ago, Gatsby was nervous and pale, while Daisy.... She cried over the shirts he owned, she cried because those shirts were beautiful. Really? I hated her with all of my heart at that exact moment. Gatsby truly loved her, he wanted to know that she only loved him and only him. It is so true that there would be that one person that will take your cool away. Daisy was that one person for Gatsby. I could not believe that Gatsby died. This one was something that I did not see coming. And it happened. I don't think I was ever this sad over a character, when nobody showed up to his funeral. He had all these amazing parties, and he had so-called friends. When the time came for people to support him, it was just Nick (a friend that he just acquired), one acquaintance and his father. I wish this book talked more about Gatsby's character. I wanted to know more of him. He just loved the wrong person..."
279,Lisa Christian,"I have been sadly remiss in writing reviews for the books I’ve read this year and mean to slowly catch up (start?) the New Year’s goal that I set for myself – namely to provide at least a small review for each book going to my goal of 100 for 2013. Nonetheless, where better to start than with one of the first American novels that I fell in love with as a teenager, The Great Gatsby? I haven’t read it in at least ten years now, mainly because my interests diverged into the Renaissance and the 18th century. But, I remember being “in love” with Jay Gatsby quite as much as I had been “in love” with Jane Austen’s Mr. Darcy. Gatsby was the mysterious and charming stranger, bold yet insecure and vulnerable, and (of course) fanatically devoted to Daisy (which seemed a cardinal virtue to my teenaged heart). I didn’t, then, see much beyond the thwarted love of Gatsby and Daisy, and I loved a thwarted or unrequited love story much more than a successful one (excepting Pride and Prejudice of course). Even then I often disdained the happy Disney endings. After all, I came of age during the heyday of James Cameron's Titanic. The story of Gatsby’s love and the disillusion of his dream seemed to me (and still seems to me) to be the embodiment of Byron’s Tasso declaring “Successful love may sate itself away; / The wretched are the faithful; ‘tis their fate / To have all feeling, save the one, decay.” But now I see the terms of Gatsby's love for Daisy differently. My teenaged-self saw this love for Daisy as personal love, for her individual self, a pure kind of holding on to a first love, and now I am much more struck by Gatsby infatuation for the dream of Daisy. I cannot feel that he ever loved her more than what she as a “good” girl of “good” family meant to him. That he put her upon a pedestal is without argument, but the real Daisy never emerged to step down from that pedestal. There was never a crack in that vision – though there might have been a later frisson when he saw Daisy’s daughter as the startling physical proof of her union with another man, or when she didn’t send for him or run away from Tom with him, especially after the accident. He held onto that vision of her as his personal Madonna, lifting himself out of his obscure and poverty-stricken background and helped remake him into the Jay Gatsby of Nick’s acquaintance. He was, of course, already on the road to carving a new life for himself prior to meeting Daisy, but she provided a glamour and a “noble” purpose for that new identity: to prove himself “worthy” of her, that he was of her class. She was his dream made flesh – the American dream made flesh, and in some way, I do not feel that he could have ever loved or remained as committed to that dream without some physical manifestation of it. He needed the fleshiness of Daisy and the sensual trapping of luxury to touch and possess and remind himself of upward mobility. After all, is not there something crass about upward mobility without a beloved attached to that dream?How could the real Daisy ever compete or live up to that image? Nick certainly seemed to grasp this dilemma, and perhaps Daisy (even in her self-absorption) grasped some of it.Yet, Gatsby remained in denial, wanted to stay true to that vision. He certainly remained committed to his self-proposed role as her knight-errant, prepared to take the fall for her. And the scene near the end of the novel with Gatsby standing in the shadows, looking upwards to her lighted windows, waiting for some sort of acknowledge or sign that she needed his rescue was more poignant and affecting to me than the novel’s tragic note at the end.For after the all the shifting identities and accumulating wealth and trappings and reputation, and even the near-realisation of his goal of “winning” Daisy, Gatsby’s dream of her and the illusion of his own identity was more important to him. It was the crux of his faith, for this was his religion (if religion might be the appropriate term) – for he worshiped her from afar (always afar) as other men and women worshiped God or the Blessed Virgin.I could go on for far longer about Gatsby’s shattered American dream tied up in Daisy and the foreboding of the dying Jazz Age in the novel. The fatalistic prose and Nick Carraway’s eloquent eulogy both for that age and for Gatsby. But frankly, this review could turn into a book!Mostly, however, re-reading The Great Gatsby reminded me how much I love Fitzgerald’s writing style, economic and meaningful and breath-taking. Every word means something."
280,Badly Drawn Girl,"It's hard to believe, given how many books I've read in my lifetime, that I never read The Great Gatsby before now. I'm in my mid-30's! Not only that, I didn't know anything about the book except that the title character is in love with a woman named Daisy. So I came into this experience with little in the way of knowledge or expectations. I read The Great Gatsby in one evening, quickly devouring each chapter. I also had a small study guide that I used following each chapter in order to add to my understanding. I have to admit that this novel deserves all the accolades it's accumulated over the years. But I'm glad I didn't read it in high school. I think a lot of people have allowed a young forced reading experience to color their feelings about this book. I think it's too layered and contains too much symbolism for most high school aged kids to fully appreciate. This is a book that can be understood on different levels but I think most people will enjoy it more as adults. I'm glad I missed out on it in high school and I'm even more thankful that I finally got around to reading it!"
281,Liesa,"Inhalt: James Gatz erkennt, dass Erfolg eine Frage der Selbstdarstellung ist und beginnt, den ""großen Gatsby"" zu spielen. Er arbeitet sich vom mittellosen Herumlungerer zum Multimillionär hoch, in der festen Überzeugung, dadurch seine aus einer besseren Familie stammende große Liebe, die inzwischen verheiratet ist, zurückgewinnen zu können.Meinung: Freitagmorgen, Uni fängt erst um 12 Uhr an, es ist viel zu kalt, um etwas anderes zu machen, als weiterhin im Bett liegen zu bleiben und neben mir, auf dem Nachttisch liegt schon seit Tagen ""Der große Gatsby"" und lächelt mir verführerisch zu. Nachdem ich zuvor ""Anna Karenina"" gelesen hatte, wollte ich mein Klassiker-Repertoire noch mehr erweitern und griff kurzerhand zum Gatsby, der schon seit Ewigkeiten auf meiner Lese-Wunschliste stand und der ganz augenscheinlich zu den Büchern gehört, die man gelesen haben sollte. Obwohl man ja eigentlich alles gelesen haben sollte. Aber jetzt, wo im Frühjahr eine wunderbare Verfilmung auf uns wartet (ich verweise nur auf Carey Mulligan, die so neben Keira Knightley eine meiner absoluten Lieblingsschauspielerinnen ist), war mir sowieso klar, dass dieses Buch unbedingt gelesen werden muss, und so kam es an diesem kalten Freitagmorgen dazu, dass ich im Bett lag, das Buch aufschlug und es erst wieder zur Seite legte, nachdem ich die letzte Seite gelesen hatte.""Der große Gatsby"" ist ein Buch, das man in einem Rutsch lesen kann und sollte. Finde ich. Es ist kurz und stilsicher, es ist spannend und gleichzeitig gleichmäßig, es ist eine Einführung in die amerikanische Gesellschaft der 20er Jahre, es geht um Erfolg und Geld und Glück und Liebe und vor allen Dingen geht es auch ums Scheitern. Denn so viel sei gesagt, statt eines Happy Ends gibt es Tote und einen Protagonisten, der voller Enttäuschung über die gehobene Gesellschaft, New York verlässt.Fitzgerald verliert sich in detaillierten Beschreibungen über die Gäste von Gatsbys Partys. Ganz genau wird uns erzählt, wie die verschiedenen Persönlichkeiten sich verhalten, wie sie reden, denken, fühlen. Wir erfahren, warum Gatsby diese Partys gibt und wieso er selbst sich so spärlich an ihnen beteiligt, wir erfahren, was sein tiefster und innigster Wunsch ist, wieso er so handelt, wie er handelt.Doch das alles erfahren wir nicht von Gatsby selbst, sondern über den Umweg eines Nebencharakters, Nick Carraway, der uns alles hautnah aus seiner Sichtweise darlegt. Er wohnt neben der pompösen Gatsby-Villa und ist letztendlich nur so etwas wie ein Mittel zum Zweck, hat er doch die Verbindung, um Gatsby seine frühere Liebe wieder näherzubringen. Er selbst denkt ebenfalls, er hätte seine Liebe gefunden, doch Jordan Baker entpuppt sich neben ihren Eigenschaften einer attraktiven und humorvollen Frau ebenfalls als zu oberflächlich und als zu notorische Lügnerin, als dass der aufrichtige und gewissenhafte Nick sich letztendlich tatsächlich eine Beziehung zu ihr vorstellen kann.Nick selber scheint ohnehin das komplette Gegenteil der New Yorker Gesellschaft zu sein. Während alle anderen viel zu sehr mit sich selbst und ihrem Leben beschäftigt sind, ist er der wohl einzige, der seine Aufmerksamkeit nicht an erster Stelle seinem eigenen Leben widmet, sondern sie eher darin investiert, die anderen zu beobachten, zu verstehen und dabei Rückschlüsse auf sein eigenes Leben zu schließen.In einer Rezension, die ich hier gelesen habe, fand ich einen treffenden Vergleich: Der Gatsby hat keine großen Höhepunkte oder extreme Spannungsverläufe, nein, er fließt dahin, wie ein Fluss. Mal ein bisschen ruhiger und gemächlicher,  mal ein bisschen schneller, mit starken Wellen. Doch nie wird der Handlungsfluss unterbrochen, er liest sich bedächtig und ruhig und dennoch mit so viel Humor und Spannung, dass es nicht möglich ist, das Buch zur Seite zu legen. Was ist mit Jay Gatsby, schafft er es, seine Jugendliebe für sich zurückzugewinnen? Was ist mit deren Ehemann, der selber untreu ist, seine Frau aber dennoch um keinen Preis verlieren will? Was ist mit Nick Carraway, findet er in diesem Drama seinem Glück? Ist der große Gatsby wirklich so groß oder ist das alles nur nach außen gerichteter Schein, um die Aufmerksamkeit der Liebe seines Lebens auf sich ziehen zu können, nachdem diese vor Jahren genau daran gescheitert ist? Fragen, die ich in dieser Rezension nicht beantworten möchte, die aber jeder herausfinden kann, wenn er sich nur einen Vormittag Zeit nehmen möchte, um dieses großartige Buch zu lesen. Ich kann es nur wärmstens empfehlen. Allen."
282,Hellen Dawn,"Oh old sport! What a tragic love story you have had. I was determined to read the book when I saw the movie. Many times have I been hearing a lot of positive feedback about the the story so why not read, I know this is going to be something worthy to read and spend your precious time with..At first you might probably say that Gatsby has the life everyone wanted to have, yet behind the magical facade Gatsby was beyond lonely. He had no one but himself. He spent half of his life reaching for that star. He was more than just ambitious and in some way delusional that he even compared himself to God. All those dreams and sky high ambitions he had in mind was all for this girl, a married girl, named Daisy Buchanan. The mysterious Gatsby without any reason throws parties at night for people he barely knew. Everyone was invited. Celebrities, politicians and biggest names in New York.In order to make a jump start of his dream, Jay, the narrator of the story, a cousin of Daisy had bought a house beside Gatsby's mansion. He is probably the only honest man in the story. One day he received an invitation to Gatsby's party. He then discovered that every party thrown in Gatsby's house was all for Daisy. Later on, Jay served as a bridge for them to meet and rekindle the spark they've had once lost.I couldn't grasp the thought that in reality there are someone who are actually like Gatsby. Why would you sacrifice and dedicate everything you've earned and toiled for someone you love even if you knew that the love you thought was right is going to ruin you and the people around you. The Great Gatsby has awaken my perception about life, dreams and falling in love. Hats off to F. Scott Fitzgerald for a wonderful piece, this is what I love about classics it never fails to touch our heart and soul. :) "
283,Rachel Dawson,"#10The Great Gatsby is a fictional story about the American Dream, following a Mr. Gatsby and his obsession with a young Ms. Daisy Buchanan.This book was like a breath of fresh air for my at the end of Honors English my junior year. After reading the southern dialect in Huckleberry Finn, I was relieved to read understandable English that flowed well. Fitzgerald's perfectly placed motifs and themes caused me to think focus on what I was reading, and ponder upon why he used certain words in certain places. It also opened me up to the idea of the American Dream, as I had heard of the concept before reading the Great Gatsby."
284,Pete,"SOMEHOW in the course of my secondary and higher education experiences I wasn't exposed to ""The Great Gatsby"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Generally regarded as one of if not the defining pieces of American literature, I decided to borrow the novel last week during some precious down time during my graduate schooling. With the hype(deservedly so)of the upcoming release of the film remake May 10th, I really wanted to read the novel first. Needless to say, I was not disappointed in my decision.I could go on and on about the lyrical mastery Fitzgerald displays throughout the book, but every other review of this classic has done and can probably do it better. Instead, I want to focus on Fitzgerald's character development in ""The Great Gatsby"". After I finished the novel at 2:00 AM on Friday morning, I took probably an hour to really just think about what I had read and try to digest it. My initial thought was that I really wasn't satisfied with how the novel ends; the most intriguing character, Jay Gatsby, is dead, and our narrator's journey just ends without much fanfare. However, after pondering it over, the Great Gatsby ends exactly how it should end. Jay Gatsby is without a doubt my favorite character of the Great Gatsby. Jay Gatsby is eccentric, rich, mysterious, and above all driven by his past love for Daisy. Despite his lavishness in the roaring 20s, he is not satisfied because he doesn't have the thing that means the most to him: true love and his true love Daisy. Fitzgerald crafts Gatsby in a way that you feel pity and empathy for a millionaire playboy living on Long Island. Fitzgerald makes him relatable because of his failures and flaws. His inability to make up for love and time lost in the Great War consumes him and ultimately leads to his own downfall. No matter how badly he wants to, he cannot get things the way they were in the past. Fitzgerald touches on an aspect of life we can all sympathize with. As Daisy states in the fateful hotel scene, ""I can't help what's past"".In addition to the character development of Jay Gatsby, Fitzgerald captures the roaring 1920s in all their ill conceived glory. In Fitzgerald's 1920s, people live a fast, extravagant life with little regard for moral questioning. The scenes of Gatsby's parties are fantastic for not only the imagery but the overall aurora that they extrude. Fitzgerald's lyrical genius is on display throughout the entire novel to be sure, but it shines a bit brighter when he describing the setting of a scene.A classic novel makes you think after you read it; not just about the book it self but life in general. The Great Gatsby is certainly a powerful novel. What it makes you think about or question is ultimately up to the reader. I am certainly glad I picked up the Great Gatsby, and look forward to the upcoming film release to see if they capture the powerfulness that Fitzgerald was able to pen so long ago. "

287,CG FEWSTON,"The Great Gatsby (1925) by Francis Scott Fitzgerald could arguably be the great American novel often desired and debated among readers and writers. This is the third time I have read the book (once in high school, another time in my twenties, and now in my thirties), and it will not be my last. Not only is the writing on a sentence level superb but the chapter structures which set up the characters and therefore the plot is exceptional and far beyond what is found in most literature in the days of sugar rushes and technological brain-fixes. Fitzgerald had a plan and followed it through brilliantly. Even the character that bears the eponymous title does not appear until chapter three, almost 1/4 through the book. A bold move by an expert hand. So, let's take a quick look at each chapter and watch how the structure of the plot unfolds:Chapter 1: Here we have the introduction to the narrator, Nick Carraway, who becomes a fly on the wall in most regards since he is from out of town, from the Middle West. He is, however, the one who holds the secrets and refuses to act in the end to either condemn or save his friends. In this chapter, the setting of West Egg, Nick's cottage and Gatsby's mansion is first briefly established, since it will be the primary central locale, most of the external and internal action revolving around Gatsby in the story. However this chapter belongs to East Egg and Daisy and Tom Buchanan and the intro to Jordan Baker. This chapter fully establishes the side of Old Money in America. ""We were in the same senior society,"" Nick tells us of Tom, ""and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own"" (pg. 7). And we get a good look at Jordan and then Daisy:""Her gray sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.""You live in West Egg,"" she remarked contemptuously. ""I know somebody there."" [Place being a heavy identifier on someone's social status is the first remark, and Nick tries to defend himself with the following statement but is interrupted.] ""I don't know a single-""""You must know Gatsby.""""Gatsby?"" demanded Daisy. ""What Gatsby?"" (pg 11)Chapter 2: Now the setting moves with Nick and Tom going into the drudges of society, where he describes it as as a wasteland and as Doctor T.J. Eckleburg watches over ""this valley of ashes""(pg 23). This is the section for Poverty in America and represents Gatsby's past as a poor, farm boy, and the chapter is cleverly placed between chapter one (Old Money) and chapter three (New Money). Furthermore, in this chapter, the characters of Myrtle and Catherine are introduced and the lover's apartment in New York City will mirror the end of the novel where Gatsby and Tom have it out for Daisy at the Plaza on a hot afternoon. Chapter 3: The Trinity of America is fully established here when the section focuses on Gatsby's parties and his mansion in West Egg (representing New Money, and situated exactly across the bay from Daisy, Old Money). The chapter even begins: ""There was music from my neighbor's house through the summer nights"" and it calls forth the Bacchanalian spirit found in 1920s America, surging against those more traditional foundations of Old Money.As for Jay Gatsby, his legend is fully established by the third chapter as a mysterious war hero and/or murderer which Nick overhears at the party (gossip). Nick finally meets the grand host by page 47, and the story quickly unfolds. And the writing here does not lag either:""The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby's house, making the night fine as before, and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with the complete isolation the figure of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell"" (pg 55). And we see that there is no way the author could have written this story as Gatsby in a first person point-of-view, like Dickens did with many of his eponymous works. Nick serves his device very well. Chapter 4: Since we have the Trinity set up (Old Money, Poverty, New Money) there is but one place to go, and that is to the past. The author/story-teller takes us to the origins of Gatsby through two methods: A) Gatsby invites Nick into town for lunch, and we get one side of the story (the legend); and Nick is told by Jordan about Gatsby from Daisy's side (the truth). And Nick sums it up best when he explains: ""A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: 'There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and the tired"" (pg 79); and this fully describes our characters and their motivations. Tom (Old Money) is pursued by Myrtle (Poverty), who chases down the yellow car by mistake and is killed. Daisy (Old Money) is pursued by Gatsby (Poverty and New Money), who is killed through Tom's misdirection and malice.Therefore, Old Money wins out with Daisy and Tom going away, likely Europe, as Myrtle and Gatsby (representatives of Poverty and New Money) are written off. Quickly now.Chapter 5: Gatsby meets Daisy, Nick as guide, at the cottage and then the great mansion is explored.Chapter 6: A reporter arrives asking questions about Gatsby's past and much of the truth begins to be revealed about Gatsby. Daisy and Tom are invited to one of Gatsby's parties. ""The he kissed her. At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete"" (pg 111). Chapter 7: (A big chapter that ignites the story and reaches the climax) Gatsby and Daisy become lovers. Then the confrontation on a hot afternoon in a suite in New York City, mirrored earlier in Ch. 2. ""I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.""""Your wife doesn't love you,"" said Gatsby. ""She's never loved you. She loves me.""That night, Myrtle is killed when Daisy hits her with Gatsby's yellow car.Chapter 8: The death of Gatsby, both real and symbolic.""But he didn't despise himself and it didn't turn out as he had imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go- but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn't realize just how extraordinary a 'nice' girl could be. She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby--nothing. He felt married to her, that was all"" (pg 149).Chapter 9: Gatsby's funeral which no one wants to attend, and a recap by narrator Nick Carraway. All done in 9 chapters and 180 pages. That's how you write a great American novel. With vivid characters, settings that help shape the story, and a plot that embodies the American dream. Here we have Gatsby as a poor farm boy (Poverty) who rises to wealth and fame (New Money) as a bootlegger, pretends to be an Oxford man (Old Money), and believes in a great, innocent love with Daisy (True Love), who he is separated from during the Great War. Nick said it best about Gatsby: ""They're a rotten crowd...You're worth the whole damn bunch put together"" (154). The Great Gatsby is a must read and a strong recommend. "
288,Ksenia Anske,"The Great Gatsby. A story of a man who dared to live a dream - for a woman who didn't. A story of one great and foolish love that's been squandered by those not capable, those that chose to watch from the outskirts of life, because it's safer that way. Because he, the great Gatsby, lived a dream that threatened to expose their own blank existence by comparison, so they participated in the feast, they tore the juiciest pieces off each dish, only to wipe their greasy fingers on the table cloth, when the party was over, with the words, that ""poor son-of-a-bitch.""Of course I can only dream to capture what The Great Gatsby is about, but this rang true to me when I closed the book. This voice kept telling me over and over. Don't you dare thinking you can, it said, don't you dare sticking your head out, I will whack you so hard, you'll be sorry. Don't you dare dreaming of style and flair and exuberance, I will yank the carpet from under your feet just so you know where you belong. Don't you dare. But I do. I will read this book many times over, to hear the story anew each time, to learn the beauty of language from those impossibly long sentences that wrapped their ideas around my head in an exquisite silk of thought. The way only Francis Scott Fitzgerald could command them. My hat off to the master."
289,Andrew Chung,"Andrew Chung Rating: AThe Great Gatsby remains one of the greatest American stories of tragedy. The plot follows the passive narrator, Nick as he recounts the interconnected and unraveling lives of the people he met one summer. Nick very similarly to the reader is a passive spectator observing events and holds a third person knowledge of all the characters' secrets and affairs. The main plot focus is the love affair between Gatsby and Daisy, who is married to Tom. The story however is about who these people truly are. During a time of great lavishness and extravagance people were able to give themselves an identity based on various things like social status and class. However the story of The Great Gatsby is about breaking down the barrier of these self-created identities revealing the true natures behind the characters. For example Gatsby threw lavish and beautiful parties, had a library full of books, and claimed to be an educated man, however looking past this self-created identity you have a tier two bootlegger who is hopelessly obsessed with a hedonistic gold digger, or Daisy. The message being, the past is always with you. No matter how much effort you put into being one way, you are who you are. I truly enjoyed this novel and would rank it in my top 10."
290,Miss Book,"“Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead.”I know,it's not a book for everybody,but I ended up liking it much more than I thought I would! The 2nd half was much better than the first,tho.More of the review coming soon."
291,Prerna Dodeja,"The writing..... absolutely brilliant. On other terms, I really liked this book; it's just that at my age I probably won't understand the significance of the plot. To me, it's just a story. I haven't really been able to figure out the ""hidden"" meaning or whatever. Yeah, I'm dumb.Though, I will definitely be rereading this after a few years to understand it better."
292,Anne,"(spoilers)Oh lord do I love this book. It feels odd to proclaim it as such, as in the past I've shied away from identifying it as an all-time favorite since it's been reclaimed by those off-putting pseudo-quirky people. But oh man, Scott Fitzgerald has hit it out of the park. Do I need to address the language? There is some beautiful phrase on every page. It's delicious. I want to eat it. The characters? Awesome. Even the hollowest among them have moments of genuine pathos. That moment where Myrtle believing she spies Daisy from the window? Beautiful. Tom, crying over the death of his lover, or carrying his Daisy when she doesn't want to get her shoes wet? Beautiful. Jordan is so proud on the telephone to Nick as they collapse; is there anyone who doesn't understand that feeling? I picture Daisy crying over Gatsby's letter. I remember the soggy letter crumpled in her hand in the bathtub. Nick. Nick is inscrutable. Always so cool (although in a different sense than Gatsby...). Detached and slightly ironic even at his most romantic...but I feel that Nick is not quite so cold as our narrator would have us believe. He tries to love Jordan, he tries to force it but he is simply not such a romantic figure, even if he craves it.And Gatsby. Oh dear. What about Gatsby? He believes in the green light; it kills him. Maybe every person is Gatsby or could be, and maybe Fitzgerald was trying to do two things at once: A. paint this picture of romanticism, of giving up everything, changing everything, for the love of one who barely deserves it, show us how beautiful and divine that is, let us bask in it, wish we had someone to love us that much, and then B. warn us away from it, tell us to be happy, to want things to a certain point and no further. I don't know what Fitzgerald intended, but maybe Gatsby is a cautionary tale.I have read Gatsby three times and taken away something different every time. This time I need it as a parable, as that cautionary tale, Anne-do-not-be-Gatsby. Hard to hear but necessary. But seriously, love her too much and you may be shot to death in your pool. Damn poetry."
293,Isadora,"""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
294,Anna,"I finally got around to reading this! First of all, I can say I'm an instant fan of Fitzgerald's prose. Though this book was a relatively easy book to read, there is so much happening under the surface that I feel like one could easily spend years studying it. For example, the book closes with a tone that seems to not be derived from the themes in the first half (nature as pristine, the idealization of eras as utopias, urban life as a corruption, etc). That last line was seriously beautiful! But when I think about it, all the gaps in constancy injected throughout the book that made my pace stutter for a moment in confusion at their apparant irrelevancy, might have led all along to an overarching theme. Foggy through in through, I think this purposeful looseness in thematics and sore lack of explanation to the reader only lends to its appeal. There are many ways to interpret Gatsby and Daisy and Tom, and while I think nearly everyone likes Nick, its interesting how many times I've heard disgust voiced especially about Daisy. I do not think any of these characters are villians, in fact, Fitzgerald seems to be more of a nihilist who views all people as inherently bad and uncaring in their own way. Yet it goes past being that simple I think. Personally, I feel sympathy for all of the characters, especially for Daisy when she makes the heartbreakingly revealing statement that it is better for a girl in this world to be a pretty fool. The male characters seem to have idealized versions of both women and the world itself that come out of an assumed sense of agency and power, while the women attempt to hold up themselves to these carbon copies, yet of course fail. Daisy seems the women who is tired of pretending. She led on Gatsby, sure, and not attending his funeral was pretty despicable. But in the end, Fitzgerald seems to focus more on the idea of being revered in life, but ignored in death. The materialism that Gatsby sought to raise himself out of the humiliation of his poverty brought him prestige, of course, but only for the might of his possessions rather than his personage. Nick is the tender hearted one through it all, who at the end, cannot help but ache for an era of pureness of intention that never truly was, as the rest of the world ""beats ceaselessly on"", pursuing their orbs of obession without regard to any of those around them."
295,Christine Marie,"Fitzgerald is truly an old sport. What a depressing way to end a book, and yet what an incredible way. It had to be done, and it was done in exactly the way it should have been. The best books are the ones that don't end nicely, happily, or dramatically, but end how they need to, how they're destined to end. The ones that change your life and force you to think, the ones that make you a little bit dismal and a little bit awed. The symbolism in this. AMAZING. I COULD SPEND ALL DAY ANALYZING IT."
296,Linh Dao,"So much praise has been said about this jewel piece of writing that I find no need to replicate. What's new for me is the way I see the book as a 17 year old teenager and as a 23-year-old self-proclaimed grown-up. If 6 years ago, I found it hard to relate to and sympathise with those unlikable in the worst way characters (which is all of them), and as a result hated the book with a passion, despite its brilliant writing; in 2014, I surprise myself by finding bits and pieces of everyone and everything, including myself, in those characters. Materialistic, self-deluded, intentionally foolish, careless, narcissistic, racist, aggressive and emotionally derived as they all are, in some way, they live in each and every one of us. This time around, I was able to let go of all of my childish, uncomplicated hatred of those complicated characters, and thus able to fully appreciate the writing. Would definitely reread it down the road to see the reflection of my own personality development through the book! "

298,Mary ,I enjoyed Jake Gyllenhaal's narration of The Great Gatsby. I've read the novel several times over the years and thought his performance was wonderful. Highly recommended.
299,Karla Betanzos,"Con este libro aprendí que las personas han sido igual de asquerosas, envidiosas,y estúpidas desde siempre, y te destrozan los sueños, y los amigos son falsos. Me da demasiada tristeza, pero al menos Gatsby pudo usar su piscina. La forma de escribir de Fitzgerald es exquisita. Me ha encantado como Nick te introduce en la historia de una manera tan impersonal. He logrado simpatizar con él. Gatsby me ha dado demasiada pena, amor, ternura, tristeza, Gatsby es la esencia del libro yQuería más de Gatsby y lo seguiré queriendo porque es de esas personas que están destinadas a ser tristes, aferrarse a un solo sueño en la vida está mal, pero ¿Qué pasa cuándo la fe solamente te alcanza para eso y crece con el tiempo? Sí el sueño era casi imposible de negarse... casi... He odiado a todos los miembros de está novela y me dan asco, y espero en otra vida se mueran y no los entierren y estén en la misma fosa común y sus cuerpos se pudran entre sí, en tanta mierda. Un libro que te hace sentir tantas cosas merece todo. A todos estos asquerosos y desgraciados personajes los he entendido porque los compadezco.Eso es todo, muchachos. "
300,Antonio Assy,"F. Scott Fitzgerald's most famous work, The Great Gatsby involves readers and makes them question every character's true thoughts and feelings, excluding ""the great"" Gatsby himself. What starts out as what appears to be an everlasting friendship with a fairy-tale ending ends up different, as the reader ends up questioning if the book began appearing to be as nice as it seemed when it was first read. Fitzgerald's use of irony and sarcasm makes the book much more interest to read, as it allows for everything to be argued on whether it contains irony/sarcasm or not. A very interesting read as it undertakes various topics that are controversial to this day. 5/5"
301,Mostafa ,سأكتب تعليقي على الرواية باللغة العربية فرغم أني قرأتها بلغتها الأصلية إلا أنني أجد نفسي عاجزا و محرجا من وصفها بلغتها حيث تصبح المقارنة مستحيلة بين براعة فيتزجيرالد و بين تخبطي الأكيد. قد لا نعرف الكثير عن الولايات المتحدة في ذلك الزمن و لكنه زمن الأحلام الكبيرة لجيل خرج لتوه من حرب مدمرة. الرواية رحلة قصيرة و مغامرة في حياة جاتسبي الصاخبة و التي أخذ فيتزجيرالد في وصفها بلغة أقرب الى الشعر أو حتى الموسيقى حتى كأنك تسمعها في ذلك المنزل في ويست إيج!قد تشعر بالغضب أو التعاطف أو الدهشة أثناء قراءتك و لكنك تعرف حتما أنه لم يستطع أحد سوى جاتسبي أن يرى ذلك الضوء الأخضر الخافت وسط الضباب عند الضفة الأخرى!
302,Meggie Ďurovčíková,"This book was a pleasant surprise. Since I had to read it in school I was expecting prolonged, deep sentences I wouldn't understand. However, the Great Gatsby has a very good flow and reading it is quite easy. I really enjoyed the book but what I enjoyed even more was a deep analysis of it and all its symbols. Pay attention to this book and analyse it, you will discover wonders!"
303,Danny Marcalo,"I read this one for a second time. The first time I remember vividly because I read the whole thing during a seven hour greyhound trip from Nashville to New Orleans in 2011. This remains one of my favorite novels, although I can't even really say why. For me, Gatsby is a great romantic above all. Then again he is a dangerously naive character as he does not see that Daisy has decided against him and probably because of money. He goes on to make this money and hopes that he can attract her, win her back. But she stays with Tom Buchanan. The difference between Gatsby and Buchanan is that Tom is of old money, that he is part of a certain aristocracy of which somebody like Gatsby can never be a part of. This is a story that saddens me deeply because it underlines that the world is not fair. This is not to say that I am a cynic about life, for one can say that life is not fair and still love it passionately. "
304,Diane Yannick,"I reread this book in 2012 and discussed it with my book club. Many others did not enjoy it as much as I do but that's okay. What they found stylishly florid, I found read out loud wonderful. What some saw as plot ambiguities, I found as reasons to put it once again on my reread list.The setting was etched with carefully selected details. As more details were added, my images became increasingly refined and luscious. The moral bankruptcy of the time was clearly shown through characterization. Enough was left unsaid that discussions can be rich. The more I learn about F Scott Fitzgerald, the more I want to think about his writing. Have started reading his short stories and must admit that I find many of them strange and their meaning inaccessible. Guess I need the Cliff notes."
305,Thomas Kenney,"It truly lives up to its status as one of the great American novels. There's so much to digest here, and there's always a new perspective to take on it. Although it definitely paints a portrait of the 1920's, the themes and struggles the book explores are universal, making this book timeless.As I read Gatsby this time, the theme that struck me was the futility and ultimate disappointment of pouring ourselves and our identity into something that can never truly be fulfilling, whether that be another person or material wealth or something else. Gatsby lives only for the approval of Daisy, and he feels he must ""earn"" that esteem. This drains him of any substance, as his entire personality is synthetic and designed to please one person.“There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams -- not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything.”""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter — tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning ——So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
306,Kelly (and the Book Boar),"Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/I have been hesitant to re-read any more of the “classics” since my second go ‘round with A Separate Peace and The Catcher in the Rye. Boy to have a take-backsies on those and maintain my memory of them being such great works of art. Hindsight is truly 20/20 at times. With the release of the new Gatsby movie and the subsequent purchase of said DVD, I added the book back to the never-ending TBR and promptly decided to never watch the film until I read the book again. Ohhhhhhh, would the memories and fondness for my ill-fated Jay live up to my high school expectations???? Or would yet another classic somehow morph into a waste of time when given a second chance? I can’t tell you how pleased I am to say that The Great Gatsby is a novel that really stands the test of time (and old age). The story of Jay and Daisy is still just as haunting and tragic as it was 20 (the number is not important ) years ago. I’m so glad I spent an afternoon revisiting this book and I’m equally glad that I can now watch the DVD that has been collecting dust for several months.
"
307,Francis P.,"Re-read this recently, at least 40 years after my first read. WOW. All that I missed! This time I REALLY got into it. I actually looked up references in the book and followed the characters' escapades geographically. I read the book on my iPad and was constantly switching back and forth between the text of the book and the website http://readingjournallit1.blogspot.co... The writing is something to savor. I found myself reading and rereading certain lines and even speaking them aloud. One of my favorites comes from Myrtle Wilson, ""“It’s just a crazy old thing,” she said. “I just slip it on sometimes when I don’t care what I look like.”""I enjoyed Fitzgerald's Midwest humor in the names he gives the guests at Gatsby's parties. I GOT the annoying repetition of ""Old Sport"". I had not recognized the significance of the ash wasteland the first time around. In short, I was not mature enough to GET the book 40 years ago.In many ways the book is unsatisfying. It leaves you hanging. There are too many things left hanging. To me, this draws the reader into the feeling of the book. The lives of the characters are full of loose strings and unfinished business. The empty feeling in the stomachs of the characters leaps into the gut of a reader sensitive to it.I decided to re-read the book several weeks ago when the NPR radio show ""Radio 360"" devoted most, if not all, of a show to the book in anticipation of the Baz Luhrmann movie. Without exception, the commentators stated that they had read the book innumerable times. One such person said that he read the book every year. Now I see why. Different aspects of the book will affect you at different times. And even if you've wrung out of the book every symbol and nuance, there remains the sheer beauty of the writing."
308,Anna Lembke,"What a phenonmenal book! What a ambitious book! What a horribly depressing book!The Great Gatsbyis a wonderful novel that appears simple, yet comes to symbolize not just a love story, but an entire countries shift in character from tradition into the prosperous, controversial Jazz Age. Gatsby is a fascinating character who keeps you hoping and praying for himself and the greater sucess of a group of people and a nation."
309,Nigel Goodwin,"I first read The Great Gatsby when I was about 11 and I'll be honest with you, I didn't like it. I was possibly too young to understand what made this American classic, a true classic and I promptly forgot all about it. Over 20 years later and I finally gave it another chance and through my slightly more experienced eyes I can now see what people rave about.A beautiful compelling novel written in such descriptive language that you truly feel a part of 1920s hedonistic americana (cliched I know).Wonderful and all too quick a read."
310,Jeanne Mackin,"Okay. I admit it. I've read this book probably eight times or more. I love the story, the writing, the significance of it all. This story, than any other novel I've read, shows the catastrophic results of classism, when some people have too much and most people have too little. Jay Gatsby has been turned into a romantic hero by the film industry (and yes, I loved Robert Redford in the role) but Fitzgerald wrote him as an anti-hero, more a victim than anything else, who grows up poor, joins the army when other young men find ways to avoid it, and prospers only when he becomes a part of the underworld, the criminal class. How can this not speak to us today? Fitzgerald died thinking this book was a failure. How wrong he was."
311,Mary Lynn,"Re-read for the 3rd time (April 2011) for my Narrative Forms class. Very interesting to compare the narrative style and strategy with James Salter's A Sport and a Pastime. My thoughts in February 2009: Re-read this lightning fast. Amazing book. Can't get over how brilliantly the ""partially-involved narrator"" point-of-view works here. Am making a vow to re-read this book regularly. I don't think I'll be sorry."
312,Lou Jonelle," F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby includes detailed context of the moral issues during the 1920’s. It gives the insight into the gender roles of the past during World War I. Flappers those days wore a lot of make- up, wore short skirt and dresses, hair short to shoulder length, and wore a lot of jewelery. People were also divided into the rich and poor (upper class or lower class). The 1920’s was a time of radical social, economic, technological changes as depicted in The Great Gatsby. The characters in this book present all of immorality of the 1920’s, but are presented as perfectly normal people. For example, Daisy, Myrtle, Gatsby, and Tom live in that world and struggle to find happiness there without regard to the consequences of their careless behaviors, showing us how rapid changer alter social values. First, lets talk about Tom Buchanan. Tom is an arrogant, a bully, a cheater, a jerk...all the words you can think of that describes a person that is far beyond mean. Tom is a wealthy man that once was a member of NIck’s social club at Yale. His attitude towards things are either racism and sexism and doesn’t try to live up to the moral standards. He has no fear about his own affair with Myrtle, but when he begins to smell something fishy about Daisy and Gatsby, he becomes outraged and forces a confrontation. Myrtle is Tom’s lover who has a husband named George who owns a run down garage in the valley of ashes. She wants to find a way out to get to Tom. Daisy is a woman that Gatsby loves, and is a cousin of Nick. During the war, she was courted with many soldiers including Gatsby. Gatsby and Daisy fell in love with each other and promised that they’d wait for each other. However, Daisy faces a feeling that she need to love again, or needs to be loved by someone. That someone was soon to be Tom. Tom asked Daisy to marry him and she did. She was tired of waiting for Gatsby because it has been too long. She now lives across from Gatsby in the East Egg district of Long Island. The way she acts with her husband is somewhat crazy, and tries to hide her pain that she feels because she still loved Gatsby. The main character in this book is Gatsby. Gatsby is a young wealthy man living in this mansion across from Daisy’s house. He watches every night across the bay and stares at the green light on the dock. Gatsby is famous for his late night parties every Saturday, but nobody knows where he came from, what he does for a living, and how he made a fortune. When Gatsby was training to be an officer, that’s when he fell in love with Daisy. Later on in this book, Nick learns that Gatsby worked through a criminal activity, and was willing to do anything to gain wealth to win Daisy. Tom and Daisy, the rich couple, seem to have everything that they could possibly desire but their lives are full of eagerly desires and possessions, that bring them to being unsatisfied with each other. Later, both commit adultery; Tom being with Myrtle and Daisy being Gatsby. Myrtle is the wife of Wilson, who was locked up in the garage later on in the book because she wanted to leave and be with Tom. Quotes that proved these affairs was when Gatsby was at Daisy’s house and was going to tell Tom that she doesn’t love him anymore. “ Your wife doesn’t love you. She never loved you. She loves me. She never loved you, do you hear? She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me! ” (pg.137). The way that Gatsby handled this problem was going to town and it wasn’t a good idea. At least have a conversation between Tom and Daisy only, and not have Jordan and Nick around. This problem affected Nick and Jordan because they really didn’t know the whole truth about how Daisy felt towards Tom and Gatsby, and also how Gatsby was working through criminal activity. Quote number 2: “Oh, you want too much! I love you now- isn’t that enough? I can’t help what’s past. I did love him once- but I loved you too.” (pg.139-140) I think this quote caught my attention because of how Daisy responded to Gatsby saying that she basically loves him and Tom at the same time. I think it affected Gatsby the most because it came to his surprise that she also loved Tom, and Gatsby wasn’t expecting her to say that. He was expecting her to say that she only loved him. To me, it made me think, “ Wow. You’re a double timer. I really thought you loved Gatsby in the end and that you were faithful, but then you loved Tom at the same time.” But then it came to my attention that she was only going for the money. As I said during the 1920’s, people really were greedy about money, and sometimes would murder somebody for it. Women would marry rich men back in the day and sometimes cheat on their husbands. The moral/message of the book The Great Gatsby is that you can’t relive the past, money doesn’t buy happiness, being rich has nothing to do with being moral, and there is no such thing as a “perfect woman”. The way that contemporary Americans dealt with the same issues that I wrote about is when the wife or husband commits adultery, they file a divorce. With money on the other hand, is still the same. The rich marry the rich, and the poor marry the poor. There are such things called lowerclassmen and upperclassmen in this world. For example, when riding an airplane, the front is for upperclassmen and the back if for lowerclassmen.  The themes expressed in The Great Gatsby as shown by the actions of Tom, Gatsby, and Daisy show their new dream of money, fame, success, glamour, and excitement. What Fitzgerald was criticizing in The Great Gatsby is not the American Dream itself, but the corruption of American Dream. "
313,Jackson,"I read 20 pages before I had to stop. The mechanism of translating formidable phrases and well-constructed sentences into my phone electronically was far too inefficient. The solution that resurrected my reading was purchasing it for cheap so highlighting could be done without repercussion. What a masterpiece.And nearing the end of the book, I realized the plot seems vaguely incoherent. Sentences of the bravura level told nothing of the relationships between characters. I could not fully assimilate the motives behind a single character. Tom.. Gatsby.. Daisy.. their connection seems so weakly tied. Then it reminded of something. It was a dream. Great things brewing in violent turbulence. Quick, unexplainable resolve. Larger remembrance of scenery than the characters acting. It was a dream. And for capturing something I think elusive, I give this book five stars. "
314,Gonçalo Carvalho,It's like jazz in the rain.
315,Xyra,"I love this book. I've loved it since I was required to read it in high school. One of the few that I enjoyed being required to read and read cover to cover. It had seemed long back then...today it's just a novella, 182 pages compared to the 400 - 800 and longer pagers we see so common place now.This is the great American dream turned great American tragedy and told to us by an unwitting bystander who became the sole friend to a man with wealth and power.Some people argue that the East West conflict is strictly told within New York. However, in the denouement Nick discusses how all the players originate west of the Ohio (and I think too the Mississippi) River and moved to New York.Here's the thing...you can read this for the symbolism and such. If you want a review that breaks down the story in that much detail, you'll have to go elsewhere or read the Cliff's Notes. To me it boils down to what I said above. The American Dream - Gatsby becoming the man that could keep Daisy in the comfort and society she was used to - turned tragedy. Only one of his many party goers to attend his funeral. So very sad. Perhaps Nick should have spread the news as ""final party at Gatsby's."" Then all the lovers, haters, speculators, and moochers would have attended.Not just tragic for Gatsby of course. The Wilsons (does the sister have the puppy), The Buchanans, Jordan and Nick all found joy and despair this one summer. Understandably, in the 1920s divorce was not nearly as easy to get. However, we still hear horror stories like this in the news now.Anyway, this story touches my heart and soul and always has. I love F Scott Fitzgerald's writing style and how his narrator tells the story. i highly recommend it for anyone."
316,Rosemarie Short,"When a novel is pronounced to me as one of 'The Great American Novels' I subconsciously, immediately, dislike it. I think the idea of anything being proclaimed great, in a very generic sense, almost always turns me off. A classic I can cope with. Pride and Prejudice is a classic. But a great novel? That's subjective, in my opinion, and opinion touted as fact is never okay. But blow me if Gatsby isn't a great novel. Despite it being very much a piece which represents its time, in a way which is both nostalgic and contemporary, what captured me was not the richness of setting; but the richness of character. Every character of The Great Gatsby is fully realized, to my eye, and has a depth of emotion, for better or worse, which is a rarity in modern novels. From the wistful, hope propelled Gatsby with his belief like life's breath in a suffocating man, to the skin deep Daisy and mercurial Tom - these characters grabbed my attention and held on for dear life until the end. The plot very much follows the fast pace and rabid energy of the age, steaming along, events passing you by like a car driven just fast enough to thrill. As a footnote; I did watch the 2013 film. I enjoyed it immensely and don't feel it in any way bastardized or lessened the impact the book had on me. In fact it probably cemented my understanding.So, if you struggle with the idea of The Great American Novel, give Fitzgerald a go; a riveting ride which stayed with me long after I'd finished reading. Scepticism, if not cured, then subdued under the undeniable proof of Gatsby's hold - more substantial than his green light could ever be and, yet, just as beautifully tragic. "
317,Sherilynn Macale,"I never read The Great Gatsby in high school. I remember on a first date once, my date said it was his favorite book. I remember wondering why.I get it now.**spoilers**I like the fickleness of Daisy. I like this depiction of her as this spoiled creature pursued by so many men, given whatever she likes, and without a care in the world. I like this idea that because she's such a princess, it doesn't occur to her to worry about things like Myrtle's death, or Gatsby's murder, or how taking Gatsby as a lover and cheating on Tom or even flirting with Gatsby openly in front of her husband -- none of it strikes her in the way it would strike a normal person because in the end, she knows she'll always have someone to look after her. She'll always be taken care of. All the harm in the world could come her way, and she'd still feel invincible.I can relate to that in a way. I get her position.And I like Tom. I mean, I hate Tom in the way you should hate any villain, but I like his cockiness. His confidence. When Gatsby and he are arguing in the hot hotel room over Daisy, and Tom ends the argument by stating Gatsby should go on ahead and take Daisy home, it's so arrogant. He's so assured he's won, so comfortable now that Daisy is under his control again, that he doesn't even mind if Gatsby drives his wife home. And I like this idea that he's obsessed with being in control of things. How when things start to fall apart between he and Myrtle and Daisy, he freaks -- to lose his wife and his mistress too, to see him sweating over that, it speaks so much of his character.And I love Gatsby's obsession. His love. The constant lusting after something he can't really have. How he's always seen Daisy as unattainable, and how he initially meant to dismiss her, when they first met, but fell in love with her because of this other world she was from, a mysterious and rich world he could never hope to understand, and a world which, in the end, forgets him completely and tosses him out in the way any ungrateful person with loads of cash could or would.And I love the perspective. I love how Nick is merely this outsider looking in on this great story unfolding in front of him. I love his perception of the mad people around him, and I love his interaction with Gatsby. With Tom. With Daisy. How it guides our own emotions toward characters in the book.It was a fun read. A short read. And it ended when it needed to.I'm glad I read this now instead of in highschool. I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much if I had read it then."
318,David Trafford,"When people say they don't like FSF's Gatsby I get offended. It's not that I feel ashamed of my taste or that I am unable to accept that not everyone will like the same things. Simply put, this book is a part of me and to criticize this book is to criticize the person I feel I am. Nick's love and subsequent angst for Jay strikes me differently after every read. Nick seems entirely unaware of the strength of his love for Jay. Yet, it isn't a story of unrequited love. It is a story about unrequited lives. Everyone has dreams, ambitions and goals and they will all go unfulilled- not because life is crual or short, not because people are selfish and ignorant, but because life's ambitions, dreams and goals are distractions. We drink, fuck and love while under the auspices of men because the alternative- to realize and stand resolute in the face of the fleeting and ephemeral truths of life is an impossibility while we live life. Resoluteness is only found in poetry, words that 'stir and strive', prose that awakens our forgotten memories- memories that remind us what we thougt was possible even though we know better than to believe in fantasy. Gatsby, more than any other book, leaves me empty and hollow when I finish reading. It pulls your deepest secrets out and forces you to continue to ignore them, therby reinforcing the constant, but neglected, vibrations that pulse, pull and push us through angst, love,fear and sorrow. These vibrations are not the human spirit. They are not god or incarnations of bliss. They simply are until they are not. FSF knows that life is unbareably worth living because it causes so much pain. All roads begin with the fear of death, no matter whose watching. Yet, the ligth glowing on the horizon will nonetheless pull us towards it. When we finally arive at the light, or the greatest party ever, or the truest of true loves, then we know and can be resolute in our knowledge that the light we chase is the one doing the chasing. "
319,Vit Babenco,"The Great Gatsby is a hymn of vulgarity and fraudulence…“But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace.”And I was literally shocked by the stupidity and the bad taste of the characters…“He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one, before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel, which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher – shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of Indian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.‘They’re such beautiful shirts,’ she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds. ‘It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such – such beautiful shirts before.’”Gatsby is a fraud and the narrator doesn’t like him but in the end he finds out that the respectable members of society are hypocritical and more fake than Gatsby.Honesty and intellect don’t mean a thing, all that counts is the art of pretending and the greatest pretenders win."
320,Amber Anderson,"Had no idea what to expect-I knew it would be good but no one ever talks about what the book is about. Even the blurb on the back cover was evasive. I won't give it away but I must say that it is powerful, indulgent, vivid, unlike anything I've read before! "
321,Hikari,"Der große Gatsby ist zwar ein recht kurzer, aber sehr intensiver Klassiker, dessen Atmosphäre einen gefangen nimmt und dessen Geschichte sich definitiv einprägt. Man sieht die schönen und dunklen Seiten der goldenen 20er und besonders in Gatsbys Haus kommen die schillernden und ausschweifenden Partys in voller Geltung daher.Erzählt wird aus der Ich-Perspektive von Nick Carraway, der in das Haus neben Gatsbys zieht - und so die Bekanntschaft seines Nachbarn macht, der ihn in das schillernde Leben zieht, in seine eigene Geschichte und die ihn zum Erzähler dessen macht, was dort vorgefallen ist. Eine tragische Geschichte, eine sumpfige Gesellschaft und ein fabelhafter Stil treffen hier vortrefflich aufeinander.Das Buch liest sich ausgezeichnet, der Stil ist sehr flüssig. Allerdings wird hier auch viel zwischen den Zeilen erzählt, sodass man doch aufmerksam sein muss, um die komplette Bedeutung zu erleben. Aber dennoch entsteht ein sehr lebhaftes Bild und ein wunderbares Kopfkino der 20er Jahre wird hier gezeichnet."
322,Sydney,"Unlike many people, I read this on my own (by that I mean not for school). I knew there was a movie coming out and I had been meaning to pick it up for a while. Last summer, while on vacation in England, I stumbled across this for £2. I figured I would pick it up and hopefully get to it at some point. I did a few days after I bought it, and finished it within a few days. I have distinct memories of reading this whilst riding through the Irish country side. That day was perfection. This tells the story of Jay Gatsby, a wealthy man that lives in New York. He throws lavish parties that hundreds of people attend, but nobody actually knows him. They just show up. His identity remains a mystery for the first few chapters of the book. As we go on we learn of Gatsby's life and his his story begins to slowly unravel. The story is told through the honest eyes of Nick Carraway, Gatsby's neighbor. We learn about Gatsby as Nick does. In a way, Gatsby is a humanized version of the 1920's: the rise and fall of the American dream. Post-WWI America is represented perfectly in my opinion. The naivety and lavish lives of Americans through this time of prosperity. And the ambiance was wonderful. I could very vividly imagine New York in the time period.This will forever be one of my favorite books."
323,Jessica Guzorek,"This is an amazing story of the mystery millionaire, Jay Gatsby. He throws massive parties every weekend hoping his lost love Daisy will come. This story goes through Gatsby's life, and is told through the eyes of Nick Carraway, the man who lives next door to Gatsby. I have to admit, I haven't read this book in a long time, but when I saw the movie was coming out I had to pick it up and read it again. This is the type of book I can read over and over and love it every time. I went and saw the movie tonight, and I thought it was pretty good. The only thing I did not like about it was the rap music they played throughout it. Otherwise, the movie followed the book pretty well. "
324,Rebecca Radnor,"Classic 1920's literature, Daisy is the green light, the orgasmic future that year by year recedes before us... read this in high school and when I realized that I had already underlined in my book all the bits the teacher then talked about, that was the moment when I realized I had actually 'learned' how to read a book."
325,John,"For as long as I can remember, every summer I've reread The Great Gatsby. It's the perfect book for lazy August evenings, times when the excitement of early summer has faded to an almost humid torpor. Because it takes place in a single season, concluding with autumn and death, it's ideal for September as well. But this year has been crazy and ugly in ways I won't cover here. So I didn't reread my favorite 20th century novel until October.Of course Fitzgerald's masterwork hums no matter what the date on the calendar. October is a reflective month, sandwiched as it is between the festive hot holidays and the gifting season. Besides the late summer was a broiler in SoCal. Every week had hot days, and September's temperatures flirted with triple digits even here on the coast. I've always loved my place in Newport Beach with its ""consoling proximity of millionaires"" and while I'd like my life to be art, it so often scarcely imitates it. Yet with this reading, I had NB's high temps as Nick and the rest headed for their ill-fated trip to the Plaza. I too would be saying goodbye to my beach home, although with fewer mixed feelings and more sadness than the protagonist's departure from ""The Eggs."" The weather broke as I read the last few pages. The high pressure system which had bound us to seemingly endless heat either broke or moved on. A cooling rain fell as I reached the end once again of a novel which touches, and teaches me in new ways every time. "
326,Charlotte Kerr,"One of my goddamn faves. Some people (My Dad) who I've recommended (thrust) this book upon have said ""yea, I've been reading it and nothing much happens."" I wouldn't say that much ""happens"" of such. Just that it requires quite a bit of mental...inclusion. I love the story, which can be interpreted on so many levels. Why has Gatsby devoted his life to a women who wasn't his? Would he have been better off without her? Would he have is palace in West Egg and acquired his riches without that Green Light? Maybe, maybe not. Gatsby was on line with Daisy, up until he asked her to admit to Tom that she had never loved him. He asked for too much. He would not accept simply running away, he had created a vision for his and Daisy's life that neither of them could live up to. But before he is murdered and after Myrtle was killed, he then realizes his life with Daisy is in mortal jeopardy and will (forgive me for being crude) take what he can get. Of course then Wilson puts a bullet in his chest has he waits for the call. I bought the Baz Luhrman DVD the day it was available and watched it twice within five hours, thinking of the symbolize and themes that Luhrman has ran throughout his films. Thanks Miss Dowd. "
327,Richelle Wilson,"Once upon a time, I read this book in high school. Sound familiar? My memories of it are fond, if a little murky: Mrs. Biddlecome's 11th grade English class. Fall 2004, maybe winter 2005 (I prefer to think it was the latter; it turns out Fitzgerald's novel is quite suited to autumnal weather and all it represents). We were split into groups to work on different novels from the American tradition; there is a part of me that remembers selecting The Great Gatsby even though I likely knew nothing about it. It's hard to say if I already knew I liked jazz music and the elusive glamour of the Roaring Twenties by then. Maybe it was just another book assigned to me. Upon finishing the novel, my group elected to make a movie as our creative presentation. We set up shop in one of the practice rooms for band and choir, re-enacting the hot, stifled scene at a New York hotel. Perhaps more than recognizing in Gatsby a host of pathetic characters caught in a web of intrigue that represents the fragility of our existence and the heartbreak inherent in human relations, we were really curious as to what ""mint julep"" was. Moose, our resident Daisy, insisted that it was to be pronounced ""mint jjja-loupe"" with a French accent. I don't think I'm the only one who was a little disappointed upon learning that it really is pronounced just how it looks [joo-lip], which seems horribly provincial and all-too-well-suited to our nasal rural Michigan accents.Now that I think about it, that little experience speaks a great deal to the entire tragedy (and I would call it that) of Gatsby's life. In reading the novel again this week (this time as a TA for an American Humanities class at the university), I saw in Gatsby a true and deep sadness. I felt sad, anyway. It was not unlike the feeling I get upon imagining a cruelly unattended birthday party. He's just the kind of guy who would want to pronounce it ""mint jjja-loupe,"" and add an ""old chap"" at the end for good measure, and there is something truly tragic in that. In this novel, Fitzgerald ironically reworks the narrative structure of the rags-to-riches tale: Gatsby is indeed destitute in his early years (although, admittedly, it seems that is only the case because he wasn't content with the middle-class mediocrity of his Midwest upbringing) and the only reason he succeeds is because he stumbles upon a rich and generous benefactor who is willing to give him a chance. However, being cheated out of his inheritance as a protégé thanks to a good-fer-nothin' woman, he ends up resorting to less savory means of building up his wealth and reputation. And to think he does this all for the love of Daisy! Five years of pining, five years of scrambling to be good enough, and finally he ends up with a gilded social empire and a huge, glorious party-house to boot. Gatsby and the other characters in this motley crew are often criticized as being flat, one-dimensional, or unrelatable. I couldn't disagree more. The characters may not be likable, but they are all fragile human souls burdened with the unforgiving task of ""being successful"" or ""living the American dream."" And if you think that this sort of decadence is buried in our country's past, think again. There is a reason Baz Lurhmann's upcoming film adaptation looks to implicate our own 21st century glitz. (Nick's final lines come to mind, ""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."")It's funny because I always pictured Gatsby as being much older than he really was. I'm about five years shy of being thirty myself, which makes his story all the sadder and more pathetic, like he aged too quickly under the pressure of building an attractive life that ultimately would get taken apart like the set of a theatrical production after closing night. His life and the novel itself really is like autumn, beginning with crisp and fresh hope and dying away into winter almost as soon as it begins. There is beauty in all that decay, though. To be honest, that was the deal-breaker for me in giving it five stars rather than four. My initial thought was that the novel might be a little overrated, and that there is a reason only high schoolers and college freshman read it (I can't imagine the novel as the subject of any of my graduate seminars, but maybe my professors are just too European and snobby). But you know what? It's beautiful. The prose is startlingly lyrical for being written in the midst of Modernism, and I found myself savoring the language, the scenes, the images. I was often taken aback by how offhandedly Fitzgerald is able to describe powerful yet often intangible essential realities of the human condition. That probably goes a little way in explaining my crush on Nick Carraway. He is a fascinating narrator because he is aloof enough to have a kind of omniscient impartiality (and really, there are moments when I wonder how he knows what he knows), but he is implicated enough to give the narration heart. I made it through the book quickly, in part because it is relatively short (180 pages), but also because it is a joy to get lost in this vivid and heartbreaking depiction of another age, now almost mythological in our imaginations, irresistibly calling to us like a lost generation.""... One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year. The quiet lights in the house were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees—he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lip's touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man's, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever"" (110-111)."
328,Gloria Chen,"LOVED THIS read it for English. Nick is the bomb and his part with Jordan saaad. Nick and Gatsby against the world dangThere are only the pursuing, the pursued, the busy and the tired"
329,Raeden Zen,"Party On(Beware, Spoilers Ahead)“The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.” –Nick CarrawayDisclaimer: I’m the same age as the narrator AND I was born and raised in NYC and Long Island, respectively, AND I live in the city AND I work in finance AND I cross the Queensboro on a regular basis. Soooo, if you were expecting a non-biased review, move along, move along, nothing to see here…I can freely admit that had I read this book five or ten years ago, I wouldn’t have made it beyond page ten. I wouldn’t have appreciated the art of the English language or the smoothness and brilliance of Mr. Fitzgerald's characterization and plotting. Luckily I waited until now, a year and a half into this new journey I’ve taken in writing fiction and appreciating the classics because this has to be one of the best books I’ve ever read. It is one part romance, one part mystery, and one part satire and together they are weaved with a subtlety and elegance that kept me glued to my kindle. It is the quintessential American novel, depicting all that is spectacular and dreadful about the American Dream.The mystery is first of Gatsby; who is this man who hosts these extravagant parties? How is he so wealthy? The rumors are he “killed a man” and as Mr. Fitzgerald peels back the onion I became more interested in finding out about this man and his past. The romance also involves Gatsby and, to a lesser extent, the narrator, Nick Carroway, as Gatsby rejoins with his love, the ethereal Daisy, for whom all his troubles are in an effort to obtain, while Nick meets the athletic and gorgeous (and stuck up) Jordan Baker.“Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where “Three O’Clock in the Morning,” a neat, sad little waltz of that year, was drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world. What was up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside? What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours? Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marveled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion.” –Nick Carraway referring Daisy, his second cousin once removed.The satire, perhaps my favorite aspect of the novel; did Fitzgerald know the US was just four years away from the great crash and the great depression? “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made. . . .” –Nick CarrawayMy guess is, no, he didn’t, but when he wrote this he could have had the crash of 1907 or any of those great bank runs of the 1800s in mind. There is always a reckoning for the party, particularly in this wonderful system called capitalism that works so well for many (but not all) and can take it all away in a flash. And isn’t it interesting how it’s usually the rich who create the disaster, and then leave the rest of us to pick up the pieces? (And by rich I’m talking John Paulson rich, and by disaster I’m thinking crash of 2008-type of mess). And that’s how the story of Gatsby unfolds; extreme highs and lows that feel like the American system and way of life. Which leads to the final point; “The Great Gatsby,” quite simply, is the embodiment of the American Dream. “Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms father. . . . And one fine morning— So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.” –Nick CarrawayThe bottom line: if you appreciate fiction at its finest give this one a shot. If you’re from New York, especially the island, this one is a must. And finally, give some thought to the current state of affairs of the USA in the context of this classic; the paradox of record users of food stamps and record levels in the stock market portends a Gatsby-like ending, in my humble opinion, but who am I? Party on, America."
330,☆♥☆Kat★♡★,Daisy is a bitch. 
331,Hailey Mandry,"I gave this book a 5 star because it was absolutely amazing. From the beginning I thought this book was going to be dragging and some what boring, however, I was wrong. The strong bound between Nick and Gatsby was relatable. I loved how Nick was always there for Gatsby during his times in need. Or how Gatsby was madly in love with Daisy, even though she was a worthless womanizer. I really didn't like Daisy as a character in this book because she used both Gatsby and Tom. She never loved them, Daisy only loved the fame and fortune. I first noticed this when she was crying for Gatsby's shirts. She wasn't really crying because she thought they were ""pretty"" she was crying because they were expensive and she knew she couldn't have them. And here is Gatsby, falling head over heels for her not even noticing that she is nothing but a bad person. Gatsby even waits till the moment he dies for her, just to fall back in a pool dead. Although it wasn't the best way to die, it sure made an impact when reading the ending because I didn't expect it. After reading this book and making connections within it I would definitely recommend this as a must read book. "
332,Faith Santiago,"Considered an American classic and a great piece of literature, F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is your typical and simple story of an outsider looking in. Nick Carraway is spending a summer in New York, more specifically in Long Island, West Egg. Nick is a curious young man when he realizes he's the neighbor to one of the city's most popular individuals. He never thought living next to Jay Gatsby would be such an adventure, but it turns out it is. Gatsby is rather mysterious and hard to read. It's almost impossible to understand who he is as a person for he hardly knows himself. Nick strives to help Gatsby discover who he truly is when it certainly proves to be tougher challenge than it first seemed. Having to deal with a town filled with prodigal city folk and uptight high class society, Gatsby is alone and confused, desperately trying to fit in. Fitzgerald's simplicity throughout the novel is what makes the book a great read. Having to read this book for my English class in my junior year of high school, I never thought that I would find so much interest in it. I usually hated the books we were forced to read but The Great Gatsby proved to be just the opposite. I felt connected to Gatsby as I know what it feels like to want to be liked and admired by all. I mean, doesn't everyone? Fitzgerald creates a character that everyone can relate to in their own way. It made me think about how I'd like to create characters just like Gatsby in my novels one day. Hopefully, I'll be just as successful as Fitzgerald and have my novels be considered American classics for many years to come. "
333,Lindsey,"I read this book for the first time in high school, as do most people. I remembered liking it more than most books they had us read, but I had not thought much about it since then. Then, I saw the previews for the new movie version coming out May 10, 2013, and it perked my interest again. I wanted to re-read The Great Gatsby before I saw the movie to remind myself of the details.Reading this book for the second time with no need to take notes in the margins, highlight, or write an essay on every little symbol and archetype made the read go by faster. It also allowed me to take more in on the actual plot and character relationships. I believe I enjoyed it more the second time, and cannot wait to see Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of this classic. My only ""complaint"" about the book is how short it is! I remember loving that factor when I read it in high school, but now that I read it for leisure, I feel F. Scott Fitzgerald could have developed the darkness of Gatsby and other aspects of characters more if he had made it a tad longer. But, still wonderful!"
334,Nyoka,I can't believe anyone would give this book less than a five. I love the comparing and contrasting between old money and new money in this book.
335,Veronica,"It's amazing how this book captures the aura of an age. The Great Gatsby is at once a lamentation and a condemnation of the American Dream. It is certain that the narrator Nick Carraway, despite his claim to “reserve all judgments” (1), is critical of the world he sees, but his reflections take on a melancholy tone at the end and seem to lament the loss—or decay—of an older form of the ideal. 	Gatsby’s dreams of Daisy can be interpreted as a representation of the American Dream. In order to pursue her, Gatsby must raise a fortune—a scenario that evokes reminiscences of America as “a land of opportunity,” which affords the possibility of the kind of social mobility Gatsby exemplifies; he goes from being a poor boy to the most splendid man in town. Carraway, who sets the tone of the narrative, seems both awed and critical of the type of “splendor” Gatsby achieves. His home comes to represent the splendor of the Jazz Age; it becomes a hub of gaiety—music, champagne, and skin-deep beauty. There is something glorious about it, but Carraway’s tone clearly conveys his understanding of its hollowness. 	It must be pointed out that Gatsby himself is not really a part of this environment he has created. His motivations are not so superficial. He does not partake of the festivities in the same way his decadent guests do, but holds on to something more authentic; we eventually learn that his parties have a deeper motive than just fun and games, namely the pursuit of love. The great measures he takes, however, do not cause us to view Gatsby as a romantic hero, though the suggestion is there. Rather it seems odd to us, perhaps because although his end is romantic, his means are low—indeed those means epitomize the debaucheries and superficiality of the age. That he uses a “shallow” means to pursue a “deep” end is problematic, and suggests potential problems in the American Dream itself: that too much freedom to pursue our desires might create a situation that fosters a libertine, artificial culture that lives only for dancing, sex, and yellow coupes. 	Tom and Daisy are partakers of this cheapened form of the American Dream. They have no “deep” motives; perhaps they have no motives at all, except the perpetual search for something to do in order to relieve their boredom. Carraway finds himself in the midst of their world, struggling not to judge. He ultimately relinquishes this “impartiality” near the end, and takes Gatsby’s “side” against them (164), turning toward the older ideal. But Gatsby’s dream is ultimately futile; Daisy proves to be just another part of the superficial world, revealing Gatsby’s ideal as an illusion. What he was chasing no longer exists. 	Even if this is true, Carraway still believes it to be a noble ideal in itself. This is the part of the dream that the novel laments at the end. In his final meditations, he looks out over the water from Gatsby’s yard and beholds an “old island” (180), a reference to the faded dream. Carraway’s contemplation of “[i]ts vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s house” (180), suggest that emergence of the house—a symbol of the artificial culture—had destroyed something older and more authentic, represented by the trees which “had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams” (180). Carraway continues: “for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent” (180), meaning the American Dream was beautiful while it lasted, but perhaps was essentially unsustainable, since man is eventually “compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired” (180). The older dream was bound to dissipate, Carraway speculates, pondering the image of man standing “face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder” (180). Freedom and democracy (i.e., social mobility and equal opportunity) are beautiful in and of themselves, but what Carraway realizes at the end is that they cannot exist forever in their perfect state. This is why The Great Gatsby is both a lamentation and a condemnation: the novel condemns what the American Dream has become, and laments the loss of its more pure form."
336,Kayl Parker,"It may be a cardinal sin in the adamant reader's quasi-rulebook, but this was my first encounter with The Great Gatsby. And honestly, the driving force was the movie being released on Thursday (starring the great and wonderful Leo and directed by the amazing Baz Luhrmann) that finally propelled me to take the leap and read the short novel. Which only took me three or four days. I'm not sure why it took me so long.Fitzgerald has an amazing way with words. He isn't romantic or poetic per say, he just knows how to craft sentences in a way that causes the reader to have to reread some lines over and over, letting the depth of it all sink in gradually but fully. I hardly ever feel the need to publish quotes on my updates, but within the 130 pages of Gatsby, I found the opportunities too hard to resist. I found myself liking none of the characters at all, except maybe, at times, Carraway. But at the same time, I was drawn into the story, sucked in, hooked. I couldn't put it down; I even let a cup of neglected coffee go cold in Starbuck's this morning because I was reading through (what I thought was) the climax that would lead to the final denouement. The book though is not lighthearted. It is a melancholy depiction of sad people in sad relationships who know their lives are sad but do very little to shift things. Don't expect to walk away with some new optimistic view on life, money and love. Like Carraway states near the closing, this is perhaps a story of Westerners in the East, Americans displaced and uncomfortable in their own country. "
337,Matthew Pennell,"There are very few novels that appear so consistently on Best Of… lists that one feels compelled to seek them out during one’s lifetime, but The Great Gatsby can certainly number itself among that rarefied set of books. It’s a slight book — only 218 pages in its first edition — and a fast read, yet the themes resonate long after you put the book down.The plotting is deceptively simple; we follow the narrator, Nick Carraway, as he moves to Long Island and enters the orbit of the titular Gatsby, a self-made millionaire given to staging decadent all-night parties and pining after his one true love, who just happens to be Carraway’s cousin, Daisy. Marital fidelity is just one of the things that end up on the bonfire of acceptable post-war behaviour; even Gatsby’s ill-gotten gains barely raise an eyebrow among the celebrity set among which Nick finds himself moving.To a modern reader there are a couple of segments dealing with racial supremacy that clang awkwardly with the otherwise timeless themes, but otherwise this is one Great American Novel truly deserving of that label."
338,Laura,"No, sadly, I have not seen the new movie. I do have the soundtrack and have been vastly enjoying it. I decided to reread the book before the release of the new movie.I loved The Great Gatsby in high school, and when I had to read it in college. I read it after college and enjoyed it then as well. I love the language of the novel and how I get something different from it each time. I love F. Scott Fitzgerald’s fabled life and his short stories. This knowledge has always deepened my love for The Great Gatsby. My review is going to be on my feelings on reading the novel this time around and not a full synopsis.This time as I reread The Great Gatsby, I really noticed Tom Buchanan much more than I remembered. He is not a nice guy, but he is more than just a mustache twirling villain. As I read it this time, I noted that he became unfaithful to Daisy very early in their marriage. He of course took Daisy for granted until he discovered that she was Gatsby’s object of desire. He also had his tragic girlfriend Myrtle. At the end of the novel, when Nick confronts Tom about Gatsby, Tom says, “he ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and never even stopped his car.” He also talks about crying after her death. While he was brutal to Myrtle in life (broke her nose!), he was devastated by her death and to him, his actions to Gatsby were warranted.What were not understandable were Daisy’s reactions. How could she so coldly never tell anyone it was her driving and cause Gatsby’s death. She never even went to his funeral and was never seen again after Gatsby returned her home and stood guard outside her house to make sure Tom didn’t hurt her. That is the real tragedy of the book to me. Gatsby may have made some unsavory deals to become wealthy, but he truly felt for his ideal woman, Daisy. Sadly, she was his ideal, and the reality of who Daisy was would never match it. One of my favorite quotes in a book full of quotes is when Gatsby says, “Can’t repeat the past? Why of course you can!” He wanted to return to his version of the past where there was a perfect Daisy that loved only him. Sadly, there never was a perfect Daisy.I could wax on about The Great Gatsby for quite a while, but needless to say, I vastly enjoyed my reread of it and I look forward to watching the movie. I also read the book as part of Colbert’s Book Club, which if you didn’t see the episode of The Colbert Report on The Great Gatsby, you should!I also love that this is a novel that is loved by many. I had students tell me that this is one of the only novels they enjoyed in high school. I like that it is loved equally by both men and women. A book that can get everyone to enjoy literature is always a wonderful thing.Book Source: My Personal LibraryThis review was originally published on my blog at: http://lauragerold.blogspot.com/2013/..."
339,Chris Ma,"A beautiful portrait of all kinds of bad faith in love, bad faith of love itself, and the grim yet un-tragic destruction of it. A new light lights up when I learned that Fitzgerald is not Mr. Carraway, but Gatsby himself."
340,Karen,"This is one of my favorite banned books -- now. Just like everyone else, I read this book in high school. Just like everyone else, I didn't get much out of it back then. I remember ""Blah, blah, blah, Jazz Age"" and ""Blah, blah, blah, symbolism"" and ""Blah, blah, blah, foreshadowing"". The problem was never with this book; the problem was the way that literature was taught. If I could have just read the book cover to cover on my own, I would have enjoyed it so much more. So, when I was in my twenties, I did, and then bought a whole lot more Fitzgerald.The Great Gatsby IS about the Jazz Age. There is strong symbolism in this book -- the green light. And there is quite a bit of foreshadowing (and foreboding) in this book -- ""the all-seeing eyes"". But there is also layer upon layer of wonderful in this book. When I first read this book, I wasn't the least bit sympathetic toward Daisy. Now, almost thirty years later, I do have some sympathy, but it is limited. When I first read this book, I didn't even really think about the child, much like Gatsby doesn't. Now, when I have a child, I kept wondering what happened to her. And that, I think, is the genius of this book and Fitzgerald's writing.Like Jane Austen before him, he is excellent at portraying his times and making his character breathe by having them speak and act in a way that is so very real. I can relate to this book at different times in my life because I can relate differently to all the characters (and symbolism) at different times in my life. I'm older now than Daisy, Gatsby, Tom and Nick. I can stand back and know what will happen before it does happen, and I can change nothing. I am ""the all-seeing eyes""."
341,Yianni Tsintaris,"I don't have the date completely correct but I remember reading this book when I was In 11th grade. My teacher gave review sheets about every chapter. I took an exam about the book at the end of the year. This Book Is very dramatic to poetic mixing genres of styles In his story. I love the poetry he uses through out the book.I even heard how this book is a legend. I really enjoyed the remake of the movie with Leonardo Decapiro,and Toby Maguire. The soundtrack has Lana Del Rey,Fergie,Jay-Z but It went by too fast than the original. The Original had themes from back then,well emotions and the clothing was well made for everyone. My dad likes the old original version that he remembers watching. Plus The Movie aspects were much lower smwhat..not really but I enjoyed the both of them.If Where speaking was well pronounced to. I wish The Old production, felt the same like the original tho(by the story). People should learn from the author's point of views. Hope you enjoyed my little review."
342,TheMadHatter,"SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERSI can't express how much I loved this book. I have never given a five star rating before so that is something. The prose in this book is so beautiful and witty and makes me laugh at the words while cry at the meaning.The symbols in this book are just powerful - whether it be ""God's eyes watching all"" or the green light that calls to Gatsby - there is beautiful meaning in every line.On one hand it is a sad and sorry tale of materialism in the 1920s - especially that of the superficial old money brigade who are only interested in advancing their own path in life and satisfying their own needs/wants. But on the other hand it is a morbid tale of how one man changed his life to become the person he had to become to win the heart of an (undeserving) girl...only to realise in the end that he would never have her anyway because he was basically not old money (and got his money the wrong way).Picking a favourite quote in this book would be like picking a favourite chocolate bar (:-P)....there are so many that called to me. I really loved ""He must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about...like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees.""I also loved how Nick sums up Daisy and Tom ""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money of their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.""I will love this book until my dying days..."
343,D.A. Cairns,"I was inspired to read the book after seeing the movie, and I'm sure it would have better the other way around. Once you have seen a movie, you know what the characters in the book look like and you find yourself making continual comparisons between the two. This is basically why books are better than movies in terms of engaging the imagination, and if you prefer novels which are character driven as I do, then you will appreciate how much more depth is achievable by the written word.Let me return to F Scott Fiztgerald's classic novel. The Great Gatsby is one of only four novels that he finished and I will certainly be hunting down the others. This is brilliant writing. A wonderful cast of characters in a world far removed from any I have known. The author's extraordinary use of language caused me to stop reading and marvel, on countless occasions. Strong ambiance and a pervading melancholy make this tragic tale of obsession a must read.Do you yourself a favour when you read it. Take it slowly. Savour it. Immerse yourself in this haunting story, and learn about the darkness which fills the hearts and minds of the lost."
344,Richard Block,"Class War, Elegantly written and disturbingly realistic, TGG is almost as good a novel as people say. Throughout the unfolding story, the underlying theme emerges like an exposed bedspring - class war.James Gatz is an everyman from the Mid West, but a self improver, and maybe more than little shady. His pre-War affair with the rich Daisy has touched the nerve of his lust and ambition, and the War wipes his moral slate clean. Hooking up with mobsters (the pernicious Jew, so obviously an anti-Semitic trope of the age) Gatz becomes Jay Gatzby and becomes a celebrity party thrower. He has a plan to lure Daisy away from her rich brute of a husband. How things go wrong is the stuff of the novel.F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote about the world he lived in, and there is the constant rubbing of the classes, much to the ruin of all. The rich are the envy of all - Jay does whatever he needs to do to join their company - which they disdain. The rich mingle with the masses merely to exploit them in some manner, and get away with murder with greater alacrity than the poor who may do the killing. The moral universe is in disorder. Seen through the eyes of young Nick Carroway, a cousin of Daisy who tells the scandalous tale, it is not a happy life for anyone, rich or poor.Please don't be put off by the book's fame - it is so well written the pages fly by. And it is short and purposeful They told you it is a great book, and for once, they're right."
345,Dawn,"Third time's a charm!I read Gatsby in high school, and wanted to like it. Unfortunately, I couldn't really understand it. Gatsby was in love with a married woman, and a billboard advertisement with giant eyes kept showing up in the story, freaking me out.Five years ago, I gave it another go. I remember it left me feeling cold. Again, I really wanted to like it, and I don't think I did. So much so that I didn't remember what happened in the story at all.So here I am again, fresh out of library books with a used copy of Gatsby on my shelf that I bought from the library sale last year for a quarter. I figured even if I didn't connect with it, I had to have my own copy, right? It's the ""great American novel""! Out of sheer determination, I gave it another go. I wanted to like it. So gosh darn it, I was going to read it in such a way that I would!I decided to go all literary student on it by reading it with a pencil at all times, so I could underline words or phrases I particularly enjoyed or felt were significant. This strategy worked! I finally know why I haven't connected with Fitzgerald's great work before: He writes beautifully, AND confusingly. I am a pretty intelligent girl, but I had to re-read numerous sentences just to be sure of where the story was going. And even with all my effort, I still ""missed"" some parts.Despite the confusing word choices or points of view at times, I found so many things compelling. If I was a high school English teacher, I would enjoy talking about it in the classroom. Here, I'll point out a few. I do so with humility. I mean, what can be said about The Great Gatsby that hasn't been said a hundred times before?First, the biggest choice I noticed from Fitzgerald was the way he described Daisy. If a man was willing to endure five years of unrequited love wherein he built his financial status to a gaudy level just to win her back, she had to be something else. Beauty isn't enough. Sounds like Gatsby had a bevy of beauties in and out of his home on a regular basis at those twinkling parties he threw. What was it about Daisy? In more than five mentions of it, Daisy's charm was embodied in her musical VOICE, of all things. It was almost obsessive how many different ways narrator Nick Carraway described it. It made Daisy seem so much more alluring, focusing on her voice instead of her hair or another physical characteristic. Just listen to these details, from a man who wasn't even in love with her:""her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened""""her voice glowing and singing""""the exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone...""""I think that voice held him most with its fluctuating, feverish warmth because it couldn't be over-dreamed - that voice was a deathless song.""""'Her voice is full of money,' he said suddenly. That was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money - that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals' song of it...""""Her voice... filled the room with a thrilling scorn""The descriptions of Gatsby, on the other hand, were largely physical - what he wore, both in clothing and in the expressions on his face. Maybe this was, in large part, due to the fact that Carraway ""found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say"" (p 69). My favorite description of Gatsby's face was this: ""an undefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable"" - I LOVE that! What a clever use of words. I must have read that sentence four times. Gatsby's best physical trait is his smile, which was used as often as the ""old sport"" phrase he uttered to win people over.I could go on with the list of quotes and word choices that Fitzgerald used with lasting power (like, ""the unquiet darkness"" - beautiful), but I will close this with my favorite quote from the novel (which I have now given 3 stars, rather than 2):""No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.""I can't wait to see the new movie adaptation this winter. How will DiCaprio portray a man who commands a room but is mostly ""smoke & mirrors""? And, will Tobey Maguire make Nick Carraway more interesting than he reads in the book?"
346,Alejandra,"This book was so perfect, I don't even know where to start. I have to say I did it in the wrong order: I watched the movie first, then read the book, which I don't usually do as it goes completely against my principles but I have to say that reading it was never my intention. However when I came out of the theatre after watching that visually-stunning and beautiful film I knew I had to read it. So I ran to the store and bought the book and man I don't think I'll ever regret it! I know it's a classic and I don't know what took me so long to read it but I'm glad I did. It is very well-written and has a great amount of beautiful quotes (the last sentence is so great!), as well as memorable characters; Gatsby has definitely become one of my all-time favorite literary characters. Plus, F. Scott Fitzgerald is very good at describing: I have spent the last few days caught between 2013 and the roaring twenties in New York, and I have to admit, I preferred the latter one. So I only have one complaint about ""The Great Gatsby"": it was too short. I didn't want it to finish. I wanted to live in its pages for as long as I could, and I could have if I just had stopped reading, but I couldn't. And I didn't want to. So it eventually came to an end and now I can only say that it is one of the best books I've ever read and one of the greatest books of the 20th century. "
347,Josilma,"The Great Gatsby is one of my favorite books, and also my favorite movie! I love the way it's set up and makes you wanna read more, just to see what's going to happen. I rated it 5 stars, because I can read the book over and over and not get bored of it. I dislike reading, ALOT so it's very rare for me to actually like a book. I love how it shows the life of wealth and poverty in the book, how there are different societies. Like West Egg and East Egg are two wealthy residential areas in Long Island, separated by a bay. While the 'valley of ashes' is between New York City and Long Island, where here there is poverty. I also love how it's about love, and how he did everything like his famous parties and the huge mansion, all for Daisy. Sad to say I got teary eyed just a little when, Gatsby died at the end, by getting shot by Wilson, because he thought it was him who hit Mrytle to death with a car. When it was Daisy driving the car. It was tragic, he only wanted one thing and ended up dying for trying. I'm not really a fan of classic books but this is one that I love a lot!"
348,Seth Kupchick,"""The Great Gatsby"" is 'great' according to Rodney Dangerfield from ""Back To School,"" but he's even more. He's a tragic unrealized larger than life figure, that is at the heart of this book, but it's not Gatsby that I remember but rather the narrator's impressions of him. I'm not sure what the technical term is for the point of view that Fitzgerald used for ""The Great Gatsby,"" but I'd call it 'suffused first person,' meaning the story is told in an almost third person like way, by a character in the story. It's one of my favorite points of view in literature, because it puts the reader both in Jay Gatsby's head, the way a third person omniscient narrator will, but at the same time has an unspoken bias, since the actual narrator is in the story, so that Nick's (?) reflections of Gatsby, illuminate his character, and Gatsby becomes him. It's kind of like a first person autobiographical novel, but far from it at the same time, because the narrator achieves a 'negative capability,' in the words of John Keats, that adds textual layers to an otherwise thin novel, almost a novella. I used a 'suffused first person' narrator for my novella ""If So Carried By The Wind, Become The Wind,"" advertised on goodreads, and I'm sure I was in part inspired by ""The Great Gatsby."""
349,Joana Monteiro,"Four days ago, I was shopping and I saw this book at Fnac. I almost bought it because I was going to watch the movie anyway and thought ""hey why not read the book first and then watch the movie so I can feel that I have SO MUCH culture"", but I ended up just not buying it. The next day, my mom came home from work and showed me this book that she had just bought. And it was ""The Great Gatsby""... Surprise, surprise. So I was like ""Put it in my room, I need to start reading again anyway"". I usually read a lot, but since I'm in college I get really lost so I hadn't been able to read anything for almost half a year. The last book I read, ""Murder on the Orient Express"" by Agatha Christie, took me only three days to read it because I was soooo into the story.The same happened with this one. It took me a while to get into it, but it grew into me and now that I've finished it I so need to cry. The last chapter was really emotional to me. One of my biggest fears is of Death, the fear of no one caring about me after I'm dead. That's really sad and that's what happens to Gatsby. He was so rich and threw such great parties, but in the end, no one fucking cares. He might as well rot in hell. And he also spent so much time trapped in his past that eventually it came to bite him in the ass and literally killed him. "

352,Anastasia Fitzgerald-Beaumont,"Fortunate is the writer who creates a novel in perfect tune with the times; fortunate was F. Scott-Fitzgerald, who, in The Great Gatsby created the novel and the times! It’s not just the novel of the Jazz Age, a term coined by Fitzgerald; it’s the novel for the Doldrums Age, judging by the popularity of a new Broadway reading of the book. I saw from a report in the Sunday press that a new film version is also planned, with Leonardo DiCaprio in the role of Jay Gatsby, the part played by Robert Redford in the 1974 adaptation. It’s easy to understand its popularity because the message goes beyond all ages, all times. It’s a novel that is read with hindsight, if that makes sense – from the lows of the 1930s looking back to the highs, the thoughtless, effervescent, champagne bubbles of the 1920s; from the lows of present-day America back to a vanished prosperity of Gekko-land and greed is good. The American dream and the American nightmare go hand in hand; they always have. I suppose there is a combination of emotions here. There is nostalgia for the good times, and the Jazz Age was in so many ways the best time of all, the best time to be young, rich and alive, whirling around in a endless round of parties and social engagements. Nostalgia, yes, but accompanied by a realistic appreciation of the sub-text; that all was not quite right, that were there is brilliance there is also decay; where there is Eden there is also a serpent. The thing about impossible dreams is that they are, well, impossible. Gatsby, it’s as well to remember, was published in the 1925, right at the height of the Roaring Twenties. It celebrates the period, it defines the period…and it presages its end. I love the figure of Jay Gatsby, a brilliant social climber who successfully manages to disguise his roots, who creates an elaborate illusion in pursuit of love. He is a fraud, yes, but he’s more endearing, nobler and more refined than the ‘old money’, represented by Tom and Daisy Buchanan. The tragedy is that he is himself deceived by a greater illusion; that Daisy Buchanan is a figure worthy of pursuit when the reality is that she is shallow, insincere and essentially worthless for all her wealth. Daisy is love alright, with money, which is to say with herself. There is so much symbolism in this simple novel, so many possible readings. Baz Luhrmann, the director of the new movie, said in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter that he sees parallels between the rise and fall of Gatsby and our modern economic hard times;If you wanted to show a mirror to people that says ‘You’ve been drunk on money’ they’re not going to want to see it. But if you reflected that mirror on another time, they’d be willing to. People will need an explanation of where they are and where they’ve been – and The Great Gatsby can provide that explanation.  Daisy and Tom still have their money; they always will. Gatsby and his kind are still on the outside looking in. Perhaps they, too, always will. And as I sat there, brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out Daisy's light at the end of his dock. He had come such a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close he could hardly fail to grasp it. But what he did not know was that it was already behind him, somewhere in the vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night."
353,Kaya,"This was my FIRST time reading this as I was in a high school magnet program for inchworms where I was assigned to read about 3 books in 4 years, including twice assigned Lord of the Flies, which I do love, BUTT yeah, high school english didn't make I bery smart.So I have to play catch up as an adult. ANd The Great Gatsby is marvelous! Duh, right? Well, I didn't know it'd be this good. I read it over Labor Day weekend and couldn't put it down. It was funny, sad, creepy, bizarre.Now I look forward to reading Tender is the Night....SPOILERS...What to make of the ending? Well, I ended up really hating Daisy. Racist Tom obviously sucks. Butt Daisy really got me. One of those c-words that string people along. Poor Gatsby - what a bummer- butt I don't feel REAL bad for him cuz I'm disturbed at his decision to go swimming the day after partaking in a hit-and-run. I mean, it's romantic to cover up for Daisy but at the end of the day, someone got killed. A little mourning please. I guess that's supposed to show his state of isolation from the world. Yeah yeah I get it. Rich Gatsby dies with barely a friend. And after pining for the love of his life for 5 years only to realize the best part of the love is in the past. Awww! Was it or wasn't it unrequited? I guess unrequited cuz that bitch flew the coop. Best song ever about unrequited love, which is the absolute most tragic and bittersweet sensation in the world I think, is ""Life's A Gas"" by T. Rex. Don't listen when you're sad or else it's waterworks tea party. If someone makes me filthy rich I guarantee I won't turn into a Gatsby! When I run over a lady with my car I will definitely not go swimming the next day. Maybe just a jog."
354,Trina,"This was my favorite novel for my entire undergrad period. I must have read it five times during those years. I was intrigued by all the symbolism, real or imagined. "
355,karen,"i love this book. yes, it is a story about vapid and shallow people who live selfish and hedonistic lives and treat other people like playthings, but there is an elegance, a restraint to the prose that manages to discuss, in the same tone, both doomed love and the breakdown of the american dream. and it is masterful. some may say the great american novel.and so this:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OULhla...makes me want to tear my eyes out with my hands and stomp on them forever and ever.yeah, you thought this was going to be a book review, didn't you? and maybe goodreads will choose to make this a ""hidden"" review under their new policies, but i don't care, because it makes me so angry that this is happening in this way that i have to scream about it, even if no one hears me, and there isn't enough room in a status update for me to vent my rage, and this is a book community, and i feel like you should all feel and share my outrage...WHO THOUGHT LEONARDO DICAPRIO WOULD MAKE A GOOD GATSBY?? AND WHY DOES IT LOOK LIKE HE IS IN THE GAP WHEN HE IS FLINGING ALL THOSE CLOTHES AROUND???it is unbelievable. i haven't read this book in years, but i know that it did not take place in some art deco-themed casino in vegas.and i assume the commentary on over-the-top consumption is just as relevant to our times as fitzgerald's, and the makes-you-squint way it is shot and the soundtrack (what is that soundtrack all about???) is a modern-day reinterpretation of jazz-age glam; a reversal of the futuristic sci-fi films of the seventies, but it is making me puke and i want to stop puking, please.this is not my american dream."
356,Ilaria Viola,"""Gatsby credeva nella luce verde, il futuro orgiastico che anno per anno indietreggia davanti a noi.

357,Catherine Yarwood,"I just loved it. There is a certain period of adjustment to the narrator. He is an odd fellow. He flip flops between adoration and abhorring over Gatsby. I wasn’t sure if there was a little gay undertone, which did perk up my interest in him. But once you get used to it, you find yourself drawn into the story. Deaths, gunshots, mobsters, mystery, adultery and at the centre of it a man with such beautiful and naive optimism. He was the only one who didn’t realise that the upper classes would have everything work out their way. And some passages from the novel are beautiful - I’m not surprised they are so widely quoted. “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”"
358,Kerry,"There are some books and authors that I read in high school when I am not 100% sure I was mature enough to truly appreciate them. Now, more years than I care to admit later, I have been re-visiting some of them to see if my opinions are still the same or has time and perspective allowed me to see the work in a new light. Some, like Thomas Hardy’s Jude the Obscure and James Joyce’s The Dubliners, are just as loathed now as they were when I was 18 years old. Others, like the works of Hemingway, appeal to me a great deal more now than they did back then. F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby didn’t make the strongest impression on me in high school, despite the fact that I was born and raised on Long Island, NY – about halfway between the locations that inspired the two “eggs” and the valley of ashes. I didn’t hate the book but I didn’t love it either. Years later in a discussion with my husband about the book, we were both amused to realize that all we really retained from our long-ago English classes on The Great Gatsby was the scene in Gatsby’s library with the owl-eyed man and the image of J.T. Eckleburg’s billboard, nothing really about the plot or Gatsby himself. After reading Fitzgerald’s “Babylon Revisited” (an excellent follow up to Gatsby) in a short story class and seeing that there is a movie version of the book coming out soon, I decided to refresh my memory and re-read the book. I found that, although Fitzgerald CLEARLY had some issues with women since not one female character was likeable or trustworthy in any way, I really enjoyed the book, particularly the character of Jay Gatsby. Although he lied about his past and who he was as a person, although his fortune was made in bootlegging and other illegal activities, and although his goal throughout the entire story was to steal another man’s wife, he is one of the only characters in the book to have any claim to integrity. He was completely faithful to his vision of himself and of Daisy (however far from reality those visions may have been – and maybe that is why eyes are such a recurring image in the story). There is something about the visual of Gatsby reaching out his arms across the water towards the green light that shines from the edge of Daisy’s dock that really captures me. In some ways, I look at Gatsby as a modern, more intentional version of Don Quixote, someone whose dreams of who they want to be and how they look at the woman they love is transformative, so strong that it is able to shape reality rather than the other way around. It is the essential tragedy of the story that Daisy (unlike Dulcinea) cannot commit to Gatsby vision and ultimately undermines his ability to maintain his fantasy. Faced with this kind of betrayal and forced to confront reality for the first time, perhaps it was a sort of kindness that Gatsby was killed and spared the task of trying to re-build his dreams. At the end of it all, the task of bearing witness to the truth and bearing the weight of disillusionment is left to those who are better equipped to face it: Nick Carraway, the owl-eyed man and the reader. "
359,Keara,"CLASSICThe Great Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald1)	I decided to read this book as I had been told it was challenging and I wanted to try read a challenging book. I had also seen the movie and thought it would be good to read the book.2)	 Daisy Buchanan is my favourite character. Gatsby loves Daisy and has for some time. Before the war in Louisville Daisy was quite the player dating many officers, and one happened to be Gatsby himself. The two immediately fell in love and Daisy promised to wait for Gatsby’s return but however she feels a greater need for someone to love her and when Tom Buchanan, a very wealthy and powerful man, asks to marry her she agrees. I think she is an important character because through her we see that not everyone is going to wait around and that things she be one and said in the present. She also becomes quite cynical and behaves superficially to (I believe) mask her pain at Tom’s constant unfaithfulness.3)	“The loneliest moment in someone’s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.” This is my favourite quote from the book as it shows that when everything crumbles around you and you can’t do anything to stop it from happening or your efforts to stop it from happening don’t succeed you are at your loneliest point and this applies to everyone’s life and shows that even in those loneliest times you have to pick yourself up and carry on going.4)	Something I thought about more deeply was the “Green Light”. The Green Light is a situated at the end of Daisy’s dock and is only just visible from Gatsby’s lawn. I feel that the light symbolizes Gatsby’s constant, never dying love for Daisy as well as his future and dreams. Early on in the book Gatsby reaches towards the light in the darkness symbolizing his wants and dreams and how he hopes to achieve them. I feel this relates to the reader as it shows that even if it is seemingly unobtainable we can still hold dreams and wishes and try to reach for them."
360,S.C. Skillman,"The Great Gatsby has been among my top favourites ever since I first read it, for my Contemporary American Literature course at university.Back in my undergraduate days, one evening in the bar, when asked what I'd like to drink, I requested mint julep.My friend looked at me, and said reflectively, ""they never even got round to drinking it, did they?""And we both knew we were talking about that tragic scene in the Plaza Hotel, New York, in the later pages of Scott Fitzgerald's novel.Why does this novel touch me - and many others - so deeply?I believe it's because we recognise the truthfulness of the themes, in our own experience of life: ""They were careless people...they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back to their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together.""One of the most outstanding things about the book for me is the sheer poetic beauty in Scott Fitzgerald's writing. Phrases from this book have stayed with me over the years: ""Daisy and Gatsby looked at me remotely, possessed by intense life"";and ""Gatsby bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths""; and finally, the famous end to the novel: ""so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.""Such is the symbolic power of the story, taking us from the immense wealth of a Long Island millionaire lifestyle into the industrial dumping ground of the Valley of Ashes,watched over by the huge eyes of a long-forgotten oculist, Dr TJ Eckleberg, that I believe The Great Gatsby is the kind of book we should be reading for our times.Read The Great Gatsby for a tragic contrast between careless hedonism/accumulation of vast wealth, and harsh reality. But don't read it for escapist romance."
361,Jodi Lu,"yeah it's supposed to be perfect and it delivers. here's scott all crystallized and brilliant, doin his thing that makes you ache so tenderly when he JUST falls short of doing it everywhere else. it's stunning, uh, chap..."
362,Kerri,"I'm still mad and somewhat shocked with myself for never having to read this or pick it up on my own time. This story enchanted me with its rich imagery, the mystery of Gatsby's character, and the intrigue of the era it was set in. Flew through all 129 pages of this in record time and am now a Fitzgerald fan!"
363,Myrna Courtney,"What can you say about Gatsby? I read it every few years for the sheer pleasure of it. And I catch something different every time. Gatsby fascinates me, with his several different beings. And Daisy's shallowness and charm fits right in there. Superb. "
364,Bryce Wilson,"Since this book seems to be a weird flashpoint here at Goodreads I might as well reveal myself as a boring canonical worshipper of Dead White Males (Though as Angelica Huston pointed out in Art School Confidential ""When they did their best work they where not yet dead) who thinks the final sentence may be the greatest last words in a book. I also submit for evidence that no less authority then Robert Altman used a character's inability to appreciate Fitzgarald to mark them as a cretinous, soulless, lackey. "
365,Caden Moses,"The moment you start reading The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald you are instantly transported through time in the ""Roaring 20's"". The novel depicts the unlikely friendship between a common man and a wealthy aristocrat, and all the turmoil that follow. As we go through the novel knowing very little of Jay Gatsby one thing is for certain, he is in love with a married women, and we get to see this play out. When I read the book there were passages that I was forced to reread because of how beautifully they were written. Overall I enjoyed this book tremendously, and I would recommend this to anyone that loves this time period or a incredibly well written book. "
366,Kahukura Royal,"Question one: What was the most exciting part? and why?Question two:Who is my favourite character? and why?Question three: Why would I recommend this text to others?Q1: The Great Gatsby is an amazing book about a mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby who lives a lavish life on long island, New York and his obsession or passion for a girl named Daisy Buchanan. The most exciting part of this book for me was Gatsby's reuanion with Daisy, this was exciting because it showed the tension between all the characters.Q2:My favourite character is Jay Gatsby because I always warm to wealthy people who live lavish life-styles, and also I love how he goes about himself witha certain confidence and jazzy snap to everything he does. He always does himself which I respect him emmensly for!Q3:I really enjoyed this book and I recommend this book to anyone because it is a good book to see how others live in the jazz age or 'roaring twenties' on long island in New york, because this is the time perios the author F. Scott Fitzgerald lived in and attend parties in similiar to those in the book The great Gatsby. I really liked this book and recommend iut to people of all shapes, sizes and age!"
367,Stuart,"The Great American Novel? More likely than not. A beautifully written, elegant little novel that contains more than a handful of fully realized characters (which is a bit surprising considering how short it is). Nick, Daisy, Tom, Jordan, Jay, Mabel, Wilson... somehow between these seven archetypes Fitzgerald is able to aptly capture the perspectives of the age and yet no one comes off as flat or one dimensional. Mingled with the stylish and yet completely reader-friendly prose as it carves out one lovely image or mood after another, the result is a panoramic view of a small segment of society that ultimately sees itself not only as the center of the world, but the only world out there. Even more haunting is how precisely Fitzgerald nails certain hours and times of the day and how these can affect you, sear themselves into your memory forever in only a few moments, and lead to decades of contemplation, nostalgia and introspection. The novel itself captures this: you can easily read this one in a weekend but it will stay with you your whole life. "
368,Alexandra,"I had always heard about The Great Gatsby and how it is such an amazing book, but I never got the chance to read it myself. Finally, I have and I loved it from beginning to end. It taught me a lot of lessons about the American Dream and the differences between being ""old money"" and ""new money."" I learned a lot about how the rich (Daisy and Tom) are very selfish and manipulative. They believe in the survival of the fittest and will do anything to relinquish anyone who is in their way. I also learned a very valuable life lesson from Wolfsheim. I learned that I should value people's friendship when they're alive because you never know when they'll die. I just think it was a really good book overall that taught a lot about how the American Dream is just an illusion and it's all about survival of the fittest. "

370,Yumi Learner,"My 45th Book in English This Year ～The Great Gatsby～A couple of days ago, I finished my 45th book, ""The Great Gatsby"" in English this year. This book was a recommendation from a friend of mine from Israel. I watched the movie in an air plane bound for the States a couple of months ago, but I hadn't read the book in English yet. When I watched the movie, it was very fascinating. I love learning American history and this book was great to learn American history and English at the same time. I think this book is a great love story from a man side. Usually, love stories are feminine, but this book is a love story about the guy. That's why it's unique and interesting. Gatsby was a very romantic guy and for a long time he had been in love with only one girl for him. He had dreamed fantasy with her, but he couldn't make it. I prefer happy ending love stories, but this was also good. I enjoyed both the book and movie. I want to buy the DVD. "
371,Yani,"Me gusta este libro y se convirtió en uno de mis favoritos después de reflexionarlo bastante. Creo que le queda mejor una calificación de 4.5. La escritura de Fitzgerald es clara (el libro se deja leer sin problemas) y el argumento engancha bastante, teniendo al misterioso Gatsby como centro. No pasa lo mismo con los personajes en sí. Sinceramente, los odié, sobre todo a Daisy. Traté de darles una vuelta para ver si había algo más allá del egoísmo y la frivolidad que todos (o casi todos) muestran, pero no hubo caso.En fin,  The Great Gatsby  es un buen libro, a pesar de que no haya cubierto todas mis expectativas. "
372,Tom Nixon,"Damn. Damn. Damn. So, I guess I'm going to have to confess, kids. I guess I'm going to have to bend over backwards and make that most humilating of admissions: I was wrong. Not only that, I was extremely wrong. For the life of me, I can't imagine what was I reading or thinking when I dragged my way through this book in the 11th Grade, because The Great Gatsby is a truly magnificent piece of literature that's eminently worth of inclusion in the curriculum of any American Lit class out there.I think my original objections to Gatsby centered around one particularly long, painful discussion about the meaning of the green lantern at the end of Daisy Buchannan's dock in the book. In fact, for some reason, I seem to remember a lot of conversations about symbolism- and not just in reference to Gatsby. It seemed to be a recurring theme that year and I must have overdosed on excessive discussions of symbolism because by the time we got around to yellow cars and green lanterns and daisies on Daisy's dress, I had just had enough. I didn't care- I wanted straightforward, no bullshit, no hippy-dippy crap about the human experience or blah blah blah. And that, kids, was a truly sad, tragic mistake of my youth: The Great Gatsby is amazing.Gatsby tells the story of Nick Carraway, a young man who ventured out East to try and make some money in the bond business after World War I. He's very much out of place in the high-minded upper crust of East and West Egg New York, (two affluent communities on Long Island) but soon discovers his cousin and her husband have settled nearby (Daisy and Tom Buchannan). Carraway is pleased to visit his cousin, but shocked when someone reveals that her husband has a Mistress in New York City- and along with that, everyone is dying to get into one of the parties of Carraway's mysterious neighbor, the titular character of the book, Jay Gatsby.In due course, it's revealed that Gatsby has harbored a long, unrequited for Daisy Buchannan and the two of them are soon reunited and renew their love- a renewal that eventually has tragic and unforeseen circumstances for all the characters.And yes, that's all I'm going to say. The Great Gatsby may well be a classic of literature but that doesn't mean I'm going to give you spoilers to sink your teeth into. Go read it for yourselves! A couple of things are worth mentioning though: first of all, is the language. Fitzgerald's lyricism is almost poetic and although he tends to wander off into the land of metaphors a little too much for my liking, it knocks your socks clean off. Fitzgerald, although my young, naive and foolish brain refused to see it, is one helluva writer. Honestly, reading this, I'm going to have to check out more of him.Second of all: there's a plot. Color me crazy, but the depth of action and plot was not something I remembered from this book, but it's all there and then some. This is actually a really good book. I can't believe I got this book this wrong!Overall: If you have a list of 'Books You Should Read Before You Die' this book should be somewhere on it- the writing is amazing and leaving that aside, the story is short (at about 180 pages) and compulsive readable and all of that makes for a pure diamond of a literary classic. I was utterly and completely wrong about this book. I've never been happier to be proven wrong."
373,Nu-Nu,"F. Scott Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby is probably the most influential classics in the English literature. Yes, it was written in the 1920's and maybe most individuals would be hesitant to pick it up and start reading, but what most of them don't know is that the reviews of this book are not in the least exaggerated.Considering what is considered quality reading today, not all of you will be surprised that right now, The Great Gatsby is not such a great read. But well, today, you may decide what the future is going to be like for you essentially. The classics are said to improve your knowledge and your understanding of universal issues and themes. So why not start now with something contemporary, exciting and satisfying?Great Gatsby is about the mysterious Jay Gatsby, who is known across New York for his gorgeous, fabulous parties where the New York's elite enjoy themselves. His neighbour and also the protagonist Nick Carraway is intrigued by his character so much so, that he dares to get close to him, be the only friend he will ever have and help him in no ways imaginable. Set in the ever-charming Jazz age, this novel truly captures the meaning of a classic!This book deserves more attention than it has been granted by the public, and I think we should give it the dignity it deserves!Full Review: http://bookstove.com/book-talk/the-gr..."
374,Bookberry,"Ein wunderbares Buch! Dieses Sprache, dieser Stil – ein einziger Genuss! Fitzgerald hat mich in die Geschichte hineingezogen und mittendrin fühlte ich mich in die Roaring Twenties versetzt, hatte das Gefühl Zeit und Raum zu spüren.An die Geschichte schließt sich ein Anhang mit Erläuterungen über den Autor und seine Zeit sowie Anmerkungen zu dieser neuen Übersetzung an – sehr gelungen!"
375,Anthony Lawrie,"It's nice when a book lives up to its reputation. I've been reading quite a few 'Classics' recently after reaching the appalling conclusion that I really hadn't read any as yet, I set forth with the Great Gatsby being very high on the list. So far it has been one of very few that I've thought really deserved the praise it has received. It's beautifully written, is fantastic in it's character description and is entertaining as it is poignant. 'So we beat on, boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past'; wonderful and inspirational writing."
376,Alexandria Steele,"I liked reading about the 1920's from someone who lived through them. I'm glad I didn't. Points to remember: don't become too focused on money, and if you go over a big bump while driving down the road, best to stop and check if you're unsure what you hit. And maybe avoid the east coast all together. "
377,Austin Hegstad,"In the early twenties, there lived a man by the name of Jay Gatsby. In the West Egg district of Long Island, New York. He was a successfully popular yet mysterious man who came into a great deal of money through inheritance, or so he says. Jay owned a behemoth of a house, right across the bay from Daisy Buchanan, a long lost lover of his. At the end of her dock was a blinking green light, that Gatsby would watch every night. Every week, Gatsby throws incredibly large and outrageous parties that are always amongst the talk of the town, hoping that Daisy would come. However when Nick Carraway, a young country boy from Minnesota, moves in to a small cottage right next door to Gatsby, things begin to turn in Gatsby's favor. Nick happens to be the cousin of Daisy. In this tale of love and lavish, you will find yourself moved by Fitzgerald's astonishing writing. I think someone who would be interested in this book would also enjoy adventures. The reason I say this is because this book was more than just a reading experience for me. I gained several insights that I would not have been able too without knowing about all the charisma that this book entails. That is what an adventure is all about. You have to understand some sort of adversity to take something from it and apply it to your own life. Anyone could read this book. It does not matter if love stories are not your forte. It is entirely about the experience that this book offers.I loved this book. Although I read this book after seeing the film, I have to say that I enjoyed the book more thoroughly. You can always watch a movie about a book, and see what another person's interpretation of the story looks like. However, reading and understanding it in your own way; being able to imagine and visualize the story for yourself is half the fun. The Great Gatsby took me into the story, and I could see what is was like for myself. It is a beautiful display of love and travesty, and it almost left me wishing there was more to it. It is short and sweet. It is easy to do something phenomenal with a book in a large amount of pages, but to do it in a small amount, is even better."
378,Arij,"It's been ages since I read The Great Gatsby... But I saw the 2013 movie last night, and I was enraged ENRAGED, and there's no better place to rant in than Goodreads. It could've been something great except the casting was terrible and the differences weren't smart.Here is a fair comparison between the two.------------------------------Book------------------------------------------“In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.

No-one really knows who Gatsby is… And those who do know him, know that he's a perfectionist to the point of delusion… Jay actually believes he could repeat the past and everything would be perfect again.

The only thing she's forever loyal to… is luxury and money.---------------------------""The artistic one""---------------------------￼NickThe closest thing Gatsby has to a best friend. The nice guy that everyone always turns to is also the narrator, Nick Carraway. He had a romantic relationship with his cousin Daisy's best friend, Jordan, but the more he knew about her, the less he liked... Such as dishonesty and carelessness of the world around her. Nick finds out that he was Gatsby's only friend, no-one close attended Gatsby's funeral, not even Daisy, which showed Nick the reality of the situation... They're corrupt and yet again careless.-------------------------""The self centered golfer""------------------JordanThe bold one with strong shoulders and autumn-leaf yellow hair. Says she is a professional golfer, but isn't so. She usually goes for less than clever men, so they wouldn't find out about her secrets and one of them was Nick who hates careless people as much as she does, and even though she is one... she wouldn't admit it. Nick finds about her dishonesty and the relationship doesn't last for long.(A tan and hair dye and she will be the perfect Jordan)--------------------------""The racist husband""-----------------------￼TomThe indirect reason behind Gatsby's and Myrtel's deaths is Daisy's wealthy, unfaithful husband. He is very rude, arrogant and loves to spout out racist comments whenever possible. Tom loves Daisy, or says he does… Either way he still cheats on Daisy with his married mistress and doesn't really care if Daisy finds out about it.---------------------------""The married mistress""-------------------￼MyrtleMyrtle and her husband own a gas station.

379,Batul,کمی اولش با زمان داستان و مکان غریبه بودم، به خاطر همین سخت جلو می رفتم. اما کم کم جادوی نویسنده تاثیر خودش رو گذاشت. غافلگیری انتهای داستان هم فوق العاده بود. اما خب آخرش حسی که به خواننده دست می ده تنفر هست و تاسف! که البته باید هم این طور باشه.شخصیت پردازی ها و توصیف ها عالی بودن. 
380,Nan,"It is simply amazing what a fantastic actor can do when reading a wonderful book.Every time I read this book, I discover something new. Listening to Jake Gyllenhaal read the book made me think about parts of it in new ways and forced me to see some scenes differently than I had before. Every time I read this book, I fall in love with it a little more. I often think it's a mistake to teach this book in high school; the sort of dreams that Gatsby dreams aren't always understandable to teens. But then I think, no, this is precisely the sort of good book that needs to be taught. If a teacher can wake students to the amazing quality of the writing and the tragedy of Gatsby, it can be life changing.If you choose to listen to this book, I think Gyllenhaal provides an amazing performance. In the movie, Tobey Maguire played Nick Carraway as someone that sits on the sidelines with wide eyes and wonder. Gyllenhaal's Nick is much more self-satisfied and judgmental. The pitch of his voice as he reads various characters' dialogue hints at Nick's disdain for them. In reading the book, Gyllenhaal guides our understanding of the characters and their actions. He presents an interpretation of the text in addition to a performance of it. There may be a better audio interpretation of this book, but I haven't found it."
381,Fia Eamónn Wåhlin,"The best feeling in the world for me is when you finish a book and afterwards you just can't stop thinking about it.This book was moore than that!I read alot, but before I start a new book I research about it and see what critics says, (and if it is a classic.I have to read it) So I basicly never read a book that I afterwards didn't like. (same with movies) and since classics are my favorite books, this book were on my list of ""must read"".And I must say, this is By FAR among the best books I have ever read! I Loved it from beginning to end. and I want to read everything this man ever wrote. It is absolutely on my top 5 favorite books now :)The setting is the the swining twenties outside New York, and we follow Nick Carraway and his upper class friends, especially the mysterious Jay Gatsby who carries a secret.I can't say enough how much I loved this book. 5 out of 5.Fitzgerald writes like no one else, and for me who doesn't have english for first language and sometimes you can have problems with older english writing, It felt like I read it in Swedish. An amazing storyteller and this book is absolutely deserving of the title ""one of the great novels of the twentieth century."""
382,Ellie,"This book is about a man named Jay Gatsby who goes to extreme measures to win the heart of the girl he loves.I read this book my sophomore year before the movie came out because my friend and I wanted to go see it and I have a rule that I can't see the movie until I read the book first. I read it a second time my junior year in English and loved it even more because we were able to go in depth about the motifs and I found some that I didn't even see the first time! I love the strength of the motifs in this story. Another reason why this story is special to me is the night that my friend and I went to see the movie we talked about it afterwards and it turned into an hours-long conversation about the choices in our lives. That was the first night that I ever voiced and defended by belief that we always have a choice in our lives, no matter what the situation."
383,Courtney,"On April 10, 1925, F. Scott Fitzgerald published a novel to emphasize love, social classes, and a theme of the past. The Great Gatsby, arguably Fitzgerald’s finest work, portrays the Jazz Age with a young, self-invented millionaire engaging in money, greed, friendships, and the past as well as the promise of new beginnings. Fitzgerald uses symbolism with the wealthy fellow, Jay Gatsby, noticing a green light at the end of the dock. We find out the significance at the end of the book, proving Fitzgerald’s suspense and symbolism.	Fitzgerald also creates a love story between Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan. Some dramatic scenes were written to show the extremes of romance in the 1920s. Many notable quotes can be found throughout the book that really touch the heart. For example, “The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime.” Obviously, this book mainly appeals to the ladies, however it is an excellent read for anyone.	The narrator, Nick Carraway, is easily understood through his paragraphs of thought and speech. The characters speak formally and elegantly at times, and other situations they hold modern day conversations. There is a big diversity between each character. Fitzgerald displayed and described every person very differently, yet they all linked together. 	Overall, I had a lovely time reading The Great Gatsby once I got into it. I would definitely recommend the book to anyone looking for a romantic novel or older piece of work. Honestly, I would tell the person to watch the movie before reading the book. From experience, with this particular text, it is easier to picture what is happening while reading if you watch the movie first. Briefly, it is important for all readers to read this piece of history."
384,Chicca,"A beautiful and poetic book about unhappiness in the unlikeliest of situations. I remember not being able to put this book down. And, to this day, whenever I see a green light in the distance (which happens surprisingly not infrequently) I think of this book."
385,Mena,"Wow. This book just . . . Blew me away. I can't even explain how I feel. I'm a little shell-shocked, even knowing what happens at the end going in. It's not for everybody. I know and respect that, but I pity anyone who cannot fathom the greatness of this literature. It takes rereading sections, it takes focus, and it takes a passion for great literature.F. Scott Fitzgerald recreates the Roaring Twenties with the keen but casual eye of Nick Carraway. His simplistic and everyday nature paints a subtly vivid illustration of the times and the rich culture. It's difficult to describe, really. Read it and I think you'll understand. Now the ending . . . The ending caught me off guard. I didn't expect to be very sad. I knew what would happen and I didn't really see how much it would affect me. Usually I'm a big weeper when it comes to books, so if I were to be sad, I expected it to be a tearful ordeal. But it wasn't. The ending isn't sad in a cry-your-eyes-out way. It was sad in a sick-to-your-stomach-with-nostalgic-melancholic-grief way. Frank Kafka once said, ""I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound and stab us."" Well, Kafka, I think this book has done more than that. This book has shot me in the chest as I lay lounging in a pool, relaxing after a traumatic day.I'll just go now and wallow. "
386,Jacqueline,"I just re-read The Great Gatsby in anticipation of seeing the new film version. I was reminded of how good this book was, and I was surprised at how much of it I didn't remember. I think each time I read it I understand it a little better, and find discover new aspects about the book that I overlooked before. In re-reading it this time, I didn't realize truly how sad this book is; it is a novella of disillusion in a sense. Gatsby's life represented the 1920s era as a whole in a sense because while Gatsby was alive and throwing decadent parties, people flocked to him and pretended to be his friend. Once he was murdered, and the parties ended, no one could be bothered with him and he died truly alone, except for Nick and his father. The 1920s were filled with grand parties, flappers and wealth (for some), epitomized by large mansions and excess, but once the market crashed, the era changed immediately and no one was left standing. I also came away with just how truly selfish Diasy and Tom were, which also kind of represented the era as a whole. Once they ruined people's whole lives, they faded back into the obscurity of their money and never looked back. They also never took responsibility for their actions. I saw this book as a critique on the era, showing that things are not what they appear, and that the 1920s was not just a fun-loving party, but that some struggled and money was not begotten in honest ways. Overall, a great read (as always). "
387,Jeffrey,"I read and loved Gatsby in high school. I have read it twice since then. It has been five years since my most recent reading. This year I have a very small American Literature class and I have enough copies for them to read it. I have never taught it before, and I thought, ""Why not?"" It also occurred to me that I should reread it with my class since it has been five years. It turns out that this novel is no less amazing than I remember.Daisy is still irritatin. Gatsby is still so cool, if somewhat pathetic. Tom is still horrifyingly despicable. Jordan is still...well, there is just something about Jordan. But the character that fascinated me most during this read is Nick. Nick is so interesting. He is aware of everyone's flaws and yet he behaves as though none of them have any flaws. Is this apathy or grace. he declares himself to be on e of the only honest people he know, but he lives surrounded by mendacity. In the end it seems to infect him too.Great novel--a must-read."
388,Shellys♥ Journal,"I read this book in my youth, but not as a part of a class or forced reading assignment. Revisiting this novel of the 1920s has been a joy, especially as I have become more interested in history and more familiar with Fitzgerald's lifestyle.The narrator, Nick Carraway, shares the tragic life Jay Gatsby, his neighbor in West Egg, NY. Carraway is from the Midwest, come to NY to make his fortune selling bonds. Although lonely at first, he develops a social life that includes his cousin Daisy and her husband Tom, Jordon Baker, a female golf star and the enigmatic Gatsby. The decadent lifestyles of the rich and famous of this time soon reveal a tangled web of infidelity, overindulgence and lies that ultimately spiral into a tragedy.I really love this story. Is it Nick's confession? How he could have stopped it all? The tale is packed with action, imagery and emotion. We are Nick Carraway walking through the party, seeing what he sees, feeling what he feels. There is a sorrow that rises from this book, of all that they had, and all that was lost. Perhaps reading this book 87 years later, much of the same things are apparent."
389,JSA Lowe,"Howwww did I not read this all these years?!? It's basically flawless YA fiction, like Plath or Salinger or...or all the other writers whom I now see were completely ripping off Fitzgerald (with ample gross racism/anti-Semitism and sexism to keep me vigilant). The only problem is, now I want writing this alarming, this weird, this good, this crafted, this pithy, and I don't know where to find it. REC ME SOME SUMMER BOOKS PLEEEEAAAZE Y'ALL"
390,Keiley,"The Great Gatsby is one of those books that one inevitably has to read at some point in their life, and honestly? This isn't even the first time I've read it. It's probably what sparked my ridiculous and never-ending descent into madness over the Roaring Twenties, the music, the fashion, the culture. Yes, The Great Gatsby might not be a particularly long book, but it has a staggering amount of content and criticism of one of the most well known periods in recent history.Because I've learned that few people actually know the plot of this book, I'll explain: Nick Carroway is a young man who has just moved to New York City after deciding to work on Wall Street selling stocks, he moves into a tiny cottage at West Egg, nestled among the mansions of the newly rich, and living next door to the most mysterious man in the city: Jay Gatsby, who no one really knows, has more money than God and throws ridiculous over the top parties every weekend seemingly for no reason. Nick gets sucked into Gatsby's complicated past and ambitions, involving his first love, Daisy Buchanan, who is not only Nick's shallow, pessimistic cousin, but married to a man coming from old money, Tom. It follows Nick through the summer as he learns the truth of what's happening around him, and as a result finds himself loathing the entire city and almost everyone in it.I don't like many--if any--of the characters. Nick Carroway is not a good person, he only really appears so because comparatively, to the people around him, he's slightly better in terms of morals. He's quiet, observant, and grows increasingly agitated and horrified as the novel progresses. Daisy is perhaps one of the most selfish characters ever introduced into literature. Though honestly, I don't blame her. Her husband is a cheating, manipulative borderline abusive man who seems to view her more as a pretty trinket than as a person, but she's not a particularly good mother. In fact, the child appears so infrequently, I can't even remember her name. But it is of note that while the novel chronicles the progression of Nick becoming disillusioned with the age, Daisy already is. I may not like her, but she speaks important truths about her situation--that the world doesn't allow her, or women in general, to be much of anything. As she says ""The best thing a girl can be in this world is a fool, a pretty little fool"". Tom is a dick, don't even get me started. He cheats and lies and manipulates. He doesn't even have the decency to hide his indiscretions from his wife, but has the balls to have a go at her for behaving the same (Coughs sexist hypocritical double standard Coughs). There's Miss Jordan Baker, a famous golfer with which Nick has something of a fling. Despite the rather harsh way he discards her for no good reason, she was actually probably the best person in terms of morals. She also has one of the best lines in the book. ""I like large parties, they're so intimate. At small parties, there's no privacy.""And then there's the great Gatsby himself. Jay Gatsby is a liar, a cheat, a fraud and somehow he's still one of the better characters in the book. He makes his money through illegal business, but who didn't in that age? He might be questionable in many areas, but Nick is right when he says that the man has an almost ridiculous amount of hope. He's incredibly determined and ambitious, the likes of which I've never seen in any person, real or fictional, before or since. Most of the things people seem to think to be bad about him aren't really all that bad. In fact, he's only even slightly questionable in his motives when Daisy suggests they run away, after he's built an entire empire for her, things he's worked hard for, and that is exactly when things get complicated. There's always going to be a place in my heart for the great Jay Gatsby.The writing itself is minimal, but memorable. There are so many lines from this book that stay with you for no reason other than they're just that stunning. Nick seems to spend almost as much time in his own head as he does in the real world, so there's a decent amount of inner monologue about the moral dilemmas surrounding just about all of the characters. Personally, one of my favorite passages in the book was a description of a character I didn't like all that well. Nick describing Daisy Bunchanan is quite unlike anything else. He describes her face as sad and lovely, filled with bright things, bright eyes and a bright mouth. Her voice is also described extensively, and the best part of it all, in my opinion, is Nick describing her gaze. That she looked at people in such a way that they were sure there was no one else in the world she'd be more glad to see.No idea why I liked that passage so much but hey, my review, right?We know from the first chapter that the book doesn't have a happy ending (And honestly, in this day and age if you go into reading this book without knowing what happens at the end), Nick foreshadows the dismal fate of Gatsby from the first page, warning us of his inevitable fate. The book shows us the glittering world of the Roaring Twenties, the music, the clothing, the parties, the drinking. And then it skillfully tears the entire age to pieces in order to show us what lies beneath. I think, truthfully, the best way we can see the progression of the novel and Nick's views on the world is comparing how he views the apple of Gatsby's eye; Daisy, at the end of the novel as compared with his shining commendations of her in the beginning. He describes her and Tom as ""careless people"" who destroyed things and people and then retreated into their money or their vast carelessness, leaving other people to clean up the mess.I will always adore this book, and honestly, this is almost at the same level of Harry Potter in terms of the confused and disgusted look I will give you if you tell me you haven't read it. It's not a long book, not even two hundred pages I don't think. You have the time, and you can buy a copy almost anywhere. So read, you don't be disappointed."
391,Dave Hill,Really enjoyed this one but if you ask me this Gatsby fella needs to get the f#%k over himself already.
392,Mackenzie Hennis,"This story gives me so many feelings. Everything about this book, except the ending, is exactly the kind of book that I love. The whole entire journey ( the love interest side of the story ) is about lovers who are in and out of love, or so they think. Though they know that they've been in love with each other the whole time. All you want is for Daisy to come back to him but she never does. It keeps you on your seat until the end waiting for them to touch for the last time. It never happens. It is an ending you wouldn't expect and someone like me would never particularly like. Even though this is the case, somehow I accepted that the ending was the ending and Daisy would have to live with her horrible decision forever. One big thing I really liked about this novel was that Gatsby was like your very best friend that you think you know everything about, but the secrets come falling like a heavy waterfall. This is one of the things that keeps you holding on. "
393,Timothy Ackerson," Go back... Go back 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 Years ago. Back in the Jazz age of america. Where it seemed that anything was possible. The steaks where low and the rewards where high.  The Great Gatsby  By F. Scott Fitzgerald will take you there, down the street and around the corner. You'll Learn what it really means to be rich, and what it really means to be poor. Daisy Buchanan, Husband to Tom Knew Gatsby a long time ago before the war, she promised to wait for him so they could be together. Tom has a mistress, Myrtle. She is wife to George Wilson. Our narrator Nick Caraway is stuck right in the middle of it all with no way out in sight. I will later explain the characters more in detail later. Tom, someone in life who has always gotten what he wants. The reason for this? He is rich, and his parents are rich, and their parents where rich. The reason that he gets to slip away with the love of his life, her completely ignorant to him sleeping around behind her back, doing whatever he wants, the only one in the book getting out totally Scott free...He's rich.Fitzgerald shows us who the rich are in our society and how they act is wrong. Everyone should be held accountable for their actions, no matter their social class. The Great Gatsby, bootlegger extraordinary Millionaire. The reason that Gatsby wanted and did make so much money is not for himself, not to feed the homeless. He did it to get Daisy back to him. He wanted to earn Daisy back by getting the biggest, the most expensive. We learn rather late in the book, that's all that she really cares about. That is why she left Gatsby, breaking her promise to stay with him, to get married to Tom. She did it because in that time, after Gatsby left, He had the biggest paycheck.  Would I recommend this book to others? Yes I would, at first when I finished the book I found it to be horrible. To be honest I did not really understand the theme , why this happened and so on. After prying down deep into what this book actually was talking about I found it to be like I struck gold and then I finally saw why this book is a classic.  The Great Gatsby  Is a magnifying glass into our problems with social class behavior. Fitzgerald shows us who the rich are in our society and how they act is wrong. In the just world and what should really be happening, everyone should be held accountable for their actions, no matter their social class or the size of their paycheck."

396,Coni,"*Trad Bruno Armando*Non ho visto il film.Ma leggendo questo librino ho avuto la netta senzazione di dun deja vu.Sì probabilmente l'avevo già letto ai tempi delle medie o salcazzo.Non ricordo.Ma non ricordo nemmeno cosa ho letto una settimana fa, quindi stocazzo. Praticamente tutti quelli che hanno una memoria, e quindi non io, la storia la sanno già.C'è tizio, il narratore, che conosce questo Gatsby.La giustapposizione col libro che ho letto prima (l'età dell'innocenza) è veramente appropriata. Gatsby è ambientato qualche anno dopo, NY non è più paesotto nobiliare ma è ormai metropoli, la costa ormai è popolata di ville di ricchi e soprattutto i veri nobili del primo novecento non sono più i residuati di lord inglesi, bensì i neo ricchi, gli arricchiti, i parvenù.Anche in Gatsby come nella Wharton c'è il tema dell'amore upper class impossibile e negato, scoperto assaggiato ma poi sfanculato.Solo che cambia l'ambiente, le convenzioni, le tradizioni. Le feste non sono più dei ritrovi di cicisbei che si guardano l'un l'altro con fare critico e gareggiano a chi è più conforme alle vecchie mode della vecchia america, garini a chi è più formae e più inserito nell'ambiente. Le feste sono un delirio di sbronze e puttanai.Le amanti sono mogli degli elettrauti, ci si arricchisce un po' con tramacci. Cosa che avrebbe fatto inorridire la vecchia aristocrazia nuovaiorchese.Il tutto è arricchito da una bella dose di cinica ironia... e va a finire a schifio con il massimo della più torbida banalità. Più che la descrizione cinematografica degli sfarzi di una società di arricchiti grazie all'anima del cazzo, la vera anima di questo librino è il senso di ineluttabile stronza fatalità. La mancanza di slancio. La rassegnazione. Siamo nel periodo più pregno e vitale della storia, forse, degli USA. Tutto sta nascendo violentemente, voracemente: Wall Street, la crisi, l'alcol, il jazz, la società dei consumi, l'automobile, la libertà sessuale (che lungi da venire per tutti, era già attuale nelle classi agiate)... Eppure qui insomma ci siamo già rotti il cazzo. E insomma, tutto questo casino per cosa? Per essere gli stessi stronzi di prima?"

398,Iblena,"Una historia extraordinaria, apasionante y crítica contada en menos de 200 páginas... Crónica de los gloriosos y locos años 20's: década marcada por el despilfarro, el glamour y la frivolidad de una alta sociedad elitista, consumista, materialista, hipócrita y amoral, pero también es la triste historia de un hombre que se hizo a sí mismo, de su amor obsesivo e imposible hacia una mujer, que lo tuvo todo...riqueza fama y fortuna, pero que nunca fue dueño de nada. Descripciones sencillas pero cargadas de una gran belleza."
399,Marco Tamborrino,"
""L'ultimo pomeriggio, prima di partire per il fronte, rimase a lungo, in silenzio, con Daisy fra le braccia. Era una fredda giornata d'autunno; nella stanza c'era il fuoco acceso e le guance di lei erano arrossate. Di quando in quando Daisy si muoveva, e lui spostava un poco il braccio; una volta le baciò i capelli neri e lucenti. Il pomeriggio diede loro un po' di tranquillità, quasi a procurare un ricordo profondo per la lunga separazione che li aspettava l'indomani. Non erano mai stati più vicini nel loro mese d'amore, non avevano mai comunicato più profondamente l'uno con l'altra, di quando lei sfiorò le labbra silenziose contro l'imbottitura della sua giacca e di quando lui le sfiorò la punta delle dita, piano, come per non svegliarla.""
Mi sembra sciocco e pretenzioso ridurre questo romanzo a una storia d'amore, come sembra quasi fare la quarta di copertina Einaudi. In realtà è l'ennesima descrizione folgorante e incisiva della generazione perduta, della vuota ricchezza degli anni Venti.Il Grande Gatsby è un romanzo orchestrato magistralmente. Un piccolo gioiello di letteratura americana. Una lettura veloce tanto quanto le vite dei personaggi. Una velocità che illude, che appassiona e che lascia infine naufragare le sue vittime su una spiaggia deserta. È l'illusione di un personaggio letterario come Gatsby, un personaggio che può essere ognuno di noi in ogni momento della nostra esistenza. Qualcuno che procede interdetto verso il suo sogno, che vuole ""replicare il passato"" pur di avere ciò che desidera. È il vuoto. È il nulla della sfarzosità, delle feste, dei cocktails, delle auto e delle relazioni. È come se Fitzgerald rappresentasse un'illusione continua ed eterna. Come se quell'illusione fosse la vita stessa.Non credo di aver parole abbastanza intelligenti e adatte per dire altro su questo romanzo. È molto breve, eppure racchiude un mondo immenso al suo interno. Un mondo da leggere e rileggere. Un mondo che, dopotutto, lascia quel senso di malessere impossibile da descrivere non appena viene voltata l'ultima pagina.Comunque, so per certa una cosa. So che da oggi in poi avrò sempre Jay Gatsby dentro di me. Nel bene e nel male."
400,Bernadine,"This is by far the best book/movie I have read/watched. This book does a good job leaving you in suspense a little. Everything keeps leading to another when it comes to the love triangles in the novel. This book is basically a sad love story, that was never noticed until the author passes. It involves a married woman daisy, and a wealthy man Gatsby. Them having past makes them have an attraction immediately. Also, on the side daisy's husband Tom is having an affair of his own but soon discovers about his wife and her other man. this novel ends in heartbreak and death which makes you think ""What If"". "
401,Daveski,"Re-read, April 2013. There was a thread on SA for a group read of this, so I started off slowly following along, but got wrapped up in it and finished early. Maybe it's just my current mental state, but the sadness and bleakness of the book really hit me harder than I remember from my previous reading. I feel like I got more out if it this time as well, maybe because I already knew the plot and could focus on the prose more. Really beautifully written.-----------------------This is one of those books that I was never forced to read in high school, so it slipped under my radar until now. Needless to say, it's a damn good novel and well deserving of it's classic status.I suppose that much of its appeal lies in the fact that the symbolism is clear but doesn't get in the way of the narrative. For example, in the scene where we first meet Gatsby, his fingers are stained with blood, clearly indicating his guilt over something that happened in the past. We never find out exactly what he did, but the secret lab behind his library (we see the owl-faced man pulling at the books trying to find the secret passage) was obviously the scene of atrocities in the past. Perhaps he was a nazi from the future who time travelled into the past to escape his crimes? This would also explain the enigmatic final line.Another scene that really struck me as poignant was when Carraway and Gatsby have their climactic lightsaber duel whilst riding robotic dinosaurs. The mournful cries of their mechanical thunder lizard mounts represented the birthing pains of the 20th century. The fury of battle escalated until the breaking point at which the wizard Baker teleported in from her moon base (""golf practice"") and started a dance party with Hall and Oates as the guests of honor. Totally rad!"
402,Nathan Rabin,"At the risk of being controversial, I thought this was a good book. "
403,Heena,I'm in love with Gatsby. By the end of this book you'll hate all but three characters and you'll be devastated and destroyed but you must read this!!
404,Hamlet Knight,pretty damn well written.. i'm glad i gave the book time to grow up on me.
405,Joshua D.,"This was a great novel, although at first glance I didn't think much of the book, but looking at it from a wider perspective has given me the chance to think more in depth and has taught me a lot. The book has a lot of great symbolism such as the green light of his love's island which shows how he is reaching for a connection especially with his past. The book as a whole is about this man trying to create a past for himself and how he tries to manifest one to those around him. I think the book has a good way of showing how us humans sometimes have a longing for something we can't have or see, and it shows how true it is that some people just want what they can't have or they just want something to say they have it no matter what the cost. It also does a good job of showing how some people have different people for different parts of their life and don't always want just ONE PERSON for EVERYTHING, and how they try to manage different parts of their life separate but they can sometimes cross paths and inter-tangle. "
406,Ruchira Bibliophile Banerjee,"Wow, this book was one of a kind. It is one of those classic novels that you never expect to like just because they have the word 'classic' attached to them. But then, contrary to your expectations, you end up loving the book. Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby was literally the book for me.I hated the characters. With all my heart.I also loved the characters with all my heart.I wanted to splatter their brains on the wall.I wanted to pat their shoulders and reassure them.However, putting all that aside, the one thing I have concretely established after reading this novel is that Fitzgerald has portrayed all his female characters as the world's biggest cows and bitches. I just couldn't get over the materialistic feel of this book, over the fickle mindset of the characters, and over Daisy Buchanan's absolute horse-shit.Let's face it, we all knew that Tom Buchanan was going to be a major asshole. I mean it was practically necessary for him to be, what with being the antagonist and everything. But Daisy? Jeez, she was very possibly ten times worse that Tom.In fact, by the end of the novel, I had come to the conclusion that except our dear narrator, Nick Carraway, there were no sane characters in the book at all. Gatsby was too 'Great' to be real; so much so, that he seemed too blind and naive for the majority of the book. Jordan Baker turned out to be a mean brat.Mrs. Wilson was never liked from the beginning. So all in all, I hated most of the characters in the book, but somehow, that is what made the read even better. I loved the language used by Fitzgerald, loved the occasional 'gonnegtions' joke, and absolutely adored the mockery of the society.A very well-deserved five stars, Fitzgerald."
407,Cassandra Lê,"Simple words cannot describe the uniqueness, the impression, the magnificent and profound ability of Fitzgerald's prose. Colors to describe emotion, hackneyed objects that symbolize a deeper connotation, repetitive imagery and ambiguous metaphors. Couldn't it just get better?People falling in disillusion, dancing helplessly in the American Dream, the disparage between the outface luxury and the inner ash moral decaying. Digging the past, searching for what had lost, refuse to concede the failing of love. Money, new and old, prejudices and social classification.Green light. Hope. You poor Jay Gatsby, with your ""heightened sensitivity to the promises of life"", your belief in the ""orgastic future that recedes before [you]"", such stupid, pure love that writhed under the heaviness of money. And before you die, did you still wish Daisy will call to you?Gullible, cruel Daisy Buchanan. [I seriously want to punch her at the end], ""wrecking things"" and ""leave back the mess"". Rely on the stability of a guy, with your beauty, there come your options - to choose whoever can help you discard your messy life? Every character is unique. They had their grandeur, and they had their defects. Brilliant mind, Fitzgerald, brilliant mind. Sorry for the nonsense rambling heheheheh heheh heh eh....nvm"
408,Briana R,"At first when I read this, it was for a junior year reading project for my English class. At first I thought to myself, ""Aw, how romantic!"" because of how Jay basically gave up his life to finding Daisy, being with her, etc. But then after looking at a bunch of different blogs, and my boyfriend speaking to me, I realized how this book is supposed to show the corrupt ways of the roaring 20s. Needless to say, I loved this book, but the junior year me wasn't completely aware of what the meaning of this book was supposed to be until all of the research commenced. "
409,Sarah,"""Some people really hated it... Others LOVED it.""  When my IB English teacher first introduced this story, I thought I would fall in the hate category. The book's title sounded like the novel was soaked with magic and unrealistic things. Plus, I had no idea Gatsby was a person; I thought it meant something like the great miracle. Little did I know I would be extremely indulged in every page, every character, and every quote. It was one of the few books I enjoyed from the very beginning. Most of the time we tend to follow the old saying ""Once you reach the middle of the book it gets interesting"". But not for Gatsby, no. The first chapter was so rich and fascinating as the story is filtered through Nick Carraway, who chooses what and what not to reveal. Plus, I encourage everyone to know the context behind the novel before reading it. It changes everything and should be considered while reading; majority of the themes are based on the circumstances during the Jazz Age. The novel includes so many intricate details that require a second read since they foreshadow events to occur. If it is your first time reading The Great Gatsby, place tiny details you feel are unnecessary in your back pocket, and toward the end of the novel, pull them out and stitch them together. "
410,Russell,"Four and a half stars for the book itself, but easily 5 stars for the Humphrey Bower narration. Like all landmark works of fiction, this will repay multiple re-readings. It's a great pity that I've waited this long for my first reading."
411,Greg Zink,"The Great Gatsby, simply put, is my favorite book of all time. I know, hardly original of me to say, but it's been true since I first read it back in high school and has continued to be the case with every rereading to this day. It seems people either love or hate this book, and I can be counted squarely in the ""love it"" category. Everything about this book - the prose, the imagery, the characters, the story and pacing, the emotion, I just find beautiful in a way that few other books approach.It's hard to exactly put into words just why I love this book so much, which is why I didn't even write a review last time I read it. Gatsby experiences and expresses the full range of human emotion, from the highs of pure love to the depths of despair, all conveyed through gorgeous writing by Fitzgerald. There's something about the optimistic hopelessness of the story that makes it seem so utterly raw and real. Sure, I can see the arguments that it's a shallow or simple story, or that readers can't sympathize with the spoiled rich characters, but I think there's beauty in the simplicity, and all the wealth in the world can't fulfill the one thing we all desire most.I'm not an English major, so I can't do really great literary analysis, especially of fantastic works like Gatsby. And try as I might, I can't really convey why I connect so deeply with this book - at it's heart I just love it because I do. Like any great work of art, it resonates at a deeper, emotional level, and that's something that I can't pass on to anyone else. You may love The Great Gatsby, or you may hate it. I just hope that you do have some book that you think is as great as I find this one. To me, this is the perfect book. Five stars, top of my list, and something I revisit every year or two."
412,Isabel Tsang,"A 4 stars out of 5. However, if the rating system was different I would have given it a 8,5 out of 10. When I learnt something about this book during English at school, I wasn't impressed. The story didn't sound interesting to me at all, but I did once say that I would read The Great Gatsby one day as it is such a known and iconic book in the English literature. The movie is coming out soon (starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Toby Maguire!) and so I decided it was time to do that right now. The WritingThis book then turned out to surprise me. I remember my teacher telling me it was hard to get through this book (due to the plot maybe?), but I strongly disagree. I have absolutely no idea what she was talking about, for to me it felt like a very short book, which I read through it in 3 sittings. The plot is pretty straight forward and the language is very easy to read. It is a very timeless writing style, with an exception for the dialogues. This altogether made it a very quick read for me. The LengthThough it is nice to be able to read so swiftly through a book, the length is one of the only gripes I have about The Great Gatsby. Because it is such a small book, some parts felt rather rushed in my opinion. Of course this is very personal, but for instance there were some parts in the book that held a fairly big significance, which you just don't really see because there weren't enough pages in the book! The PlotAside from that one gripe, I did surprisingly like this book. The plot is not half as complicated as English teachers are suggesting. In fact, it is a very simple one, almost shallow actually if you would compare it to, let's say, A Song of Ice and Fire or the YA series Harry Potter (the page count of course plays a part in this as well). It is a story of love, money and betrayal, all coated with the American Dream, which is not a fairy tale world after all. Especially seeing this side of things makes it a very sad book in my opinion, because there is not a single happy, content character to be found despite all the money and glamour of their lives. My heart especially went out to Jay Gatsby, who is a surprisingly likable character (different from Leonardo DiCaprio's smirk on the movie poster suggests), and one of the aspects I liked the most was the friendship and trust he and Nick Carraway develop as the story is progressing. ConclusionAltogether I really liked this book and am very glad I read it. One of the biggest flaws in my opinion is the length of the story, making it feel kind of shallow and as if you are missing some parts. Aside from that, I am still very impressed how this book managed to make me feel during the climax and near the end despite the supposed shallowness of it. The Great Gatsby really managed to surprised me: that is why I really liked it after all. "
413,Greg Fox,One of the best books ever written
414,Sarae," 20 miles from New York is a town by the name of West Egg not to be confused with East Egg. A young man by the name of Nick Carraway moves in to this town and after visiting his cousin Daisy, he begins to observe two simultaneous love affairs. These affairs continue throughout the book with surprising twists and turns that you would not expect making The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald a romantic classic read.What makes this book so interesting is the variety of different elements Fitzgerald used throughout this classic. The way his writing differentiates from other classic writers is firstly the point of view for which the story is being written as well as the time period the story takes place. Instead of the story being told by the point of view of a main character the writer uses an outsider to view the complex infidelities occurring before him. As for the time period Fitzgerald chose to write this book in the time known as the 20’s. He used many detailed descriptions to show an inside look at a world so few were a part of.As for my life relating to this story, I found it somewhat difficult to relate with because of how confusing it was for me to understand. Aside from the difficulty I had understanding it, re-reading pages really helped me to comprehend it better leading me to find how it related to my life. Being the romantic book that it was, it definitely reminded me of high school relationships. Not that people have what you would call an affair just how some people are kept apart from being together for some ridiculous reasons and how there are always bystanders gossiping or telling their point of view as for what is going on. The one thing about this book that I thought didn’t relate to me very well was how glamorous the writer made all of the infidelities sound. In reality I feel as though that is completely wrong and if people feel that way they definitely should get a divorce.Overall after reading this book I was very surprised at how it ended, which I really liked because I would rather be surprised then know exactly what is coming up. I would recommend this book to people that like drama, romance and a little bit of mystery all in one. While reading this book although I was little confused at times, I wanted to keep reading to figure out what was to happen next and had a hard time putting it down. I hope that people that read this book enjoy it as much as I did."
415,Ricardo,"Leí este libro en el colegio, creo que en una versión reducida. Pero en realidad mi única referencia de Gatsby era la película de Robert Redford, de la que no conservo tampoco el mejor de los recuerdos (plenty of nothing). El comentario de un amigo (gracias Dani) me tentó y se transformó en la primera lectura del 2013. Lo terminé hace un par de semanas y me dejó en estado de éxtasis, con el convencimiento de que es una de las grandes cosas que uno leerá en la vida y a la que querrá volver cada tanto. Cuesta creer que Scott Fitzgerald tenía solo 29 años cuando la escribió de un tirón en la Riviera francesa, y que ya estaba tan desengañado del mundo que lo rodeaba que era capaz de observarlo en todo su cinismo, su insolencia y su violencia. Lo que no cuesta nada es imaginar porqué terminaría su corta vida escribiendo guiones para Hollywood: son numerosos los pasajes donde la descripción es tan vívida que parece que uno está viendo una película. Un ejemplo cualquiera, la presentación del personaje de Daisy:""Atravesamos un vestíbulo de techo muy alto hasta un espacio rosa y luminoso, que se unía frágilmente a la casa por dos puertas de cristales. Las cristaleras estaban entreabiertas y brillaban, blancas, en contraste con la hierba fresca del exterior, que casi parecía entrar dentro de la casa. En la habitación soplaba una brisa ligera: agitaba las cortinas como banderas pálidas y divididas entre el interior y el exterior, las retorcía hacia el techo, una especie de tarta de boda, y rizaba el tapiz de color vino, oscureciéndolo, como el viento oscurece el mar.El único objeto que permanecía absolutamente inmóvil en la habitación era un enorme sofá en el que dos jóvenes flotaban como sobre un globo sujeto a tierra. Las dos iban de blanco y sus vestidos ondeaban y aleteaban como recién llegados de un vuelo fugaz alrededor de la casa. Tuve que permanecer de pie un rato, escuchando los latigazos de las cortinas y el chirriar de un cuadro en la pared. Entonces se oyó una explosión: Tom Buchanan había cerrado las ventanas traseras, y cesó el viento atrapado en la habitación, y las cortinas, los tapices y los vestidos de las dos mujeres volvieron a posarse lentamente en el suelo.(…) Miré de nuevo a mi prima, que empezó a hacerme preguntas con voz grave, perturbadora. Era una de esas voces que el oído sigue en sus descensos y subidas, como si cada frase fuera una sucesión de notas que jamás volverán a sonar juntas. Tenía una cara triste y deliciosa, con detalles luminosos –los ojos luminosos y la luz apasionada de la boca– y había en su voz una emoción que los hombres que la habían querido no podían olvidar: una vehemencia cantarina, un «óyeme» susurrado, la promesa de que acababa de vivir momentos felices y vibrantes y que momentos felices y vibrantes esperaban en la próxima hora.""A medida que avanzaba en la lectura no podía dejar de pensar en dos películas: Vértigo (Hitchcock) y 2046 (Kar-wai), en esa búsqueda incesante del amor que un día se tuvo y se perdió, que son capaces de recrear la ilusión a cualquier precio para poder sobrevivir a los estragos del corazón. De la ilusión a la obsesión y a la caída. También Gatsby vuelve la mirada hacia atrás y es devorado por ""el polvo viciado que dejaban sus sueños"". Placer enorme esta lectura, esta inmersión en una Nueva York mítica, un mundo de cenizas y diamantes poblado de criaturas espléndidas, deslumbrantes y otras igualmente repugnantes. La edición de Anagrama incluye un breve pero muy certero epílogo de Justo Navarro (su traductor) que revisa en un juego de espejos a los seis personajes principales y secundarios. Bienvenido, lo mismo que las notas a pie de página que a lo largo de toda la obra aclaran puntos en común entre el personaje y su autor o brindan claves al lector acerca de obras literarias o musicales que se mencionan. Es el primer libro que leo de Anagrama que viene comentado.El mes que viene llega otra adaptación cinematográfica. Todo indica que se trata de otro ""novelicidio""."
416,Jim From YAYeahYeah,"‘’No — Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.’’The above sentence is probably my favourite sentence in all of literature, although this book’s final sentence pushes it close. Gatsby, for readers who haven’t had the pleasure of encountering this classic novel before, is a story told by Nick Carraway, a young bachelor learning the bond business in New York City in 1922. But it’s not Nick’s story – it’s the story of Jay Gatsby, the mysterious young man who throws famously lavish parties, and of Nick’s cousin Daisy Buchanan, who Gatsby loved and thought he’d lost. As Nick observes helplessly, the title character obsessively pursues the girl despite her marriage to the obnoxious Tom, and events reach a tragic conclusion.While I can read books properly first time around, I have a habit of skim-reading books when reading them for the 2nd or 3rd time, focusing on my favourite passages and skipping bits here and there. Gatsby is one of the very few exceptions to this. Despite having read it perhaps 8 or 9 times now, every time I pick it up I’m drawn so completely back into the world of the Jazz Age that I read it word for word. Oh, it helps that it’s incredibly short for its classic status – weighing in at somewhat under 200 pages, depending on your edition – but I honestly don’t think there’s a word out of place in the book. Gatsby is a beguiling main figure, Nick a perfect narrator – staunch and loyal, and unable to fully understand the passionate love Gatsby bears for Daisy – and Tom is a vile buffoon who provides a perfect villain. Fitzgerald’s descriptions have a way of transporting you fully into the place he’s writing about, whether it’s a massive party hosted by Gatsby or a ell-fanned Forty-second Street cellar, and the quality of his writing is perfect. If I could recommend just one classic book to readers young and old, in the hope they would fall in love with it, it would be this one every time. Highest possible recommendation to all. "
417,funkgoddess,the novel against which ALL novels are judged. and usually found wanting.
418,Mikael,"Being a European (Swedish to be more precise) my reading in both school and on my free time has always been somewhat eurocentric, so I figured that I should start my venture into the classics of American literature with one of the supposedly greatest works of fiction ever written on the other side of the Atlantic. Constantly and endlessly cited as one of the greatest novel in the literary history of USA. I was not disappointed. The book: ""The Great Gatsby"".Following Nick Carraway, the narrator of this particular story and next door neighbour to the mysterious protagonist, billionaire Jay Gatsby, author Fitzgerald always left me wanting more by the simple technique of adding more and new questions after one has been answered. An example is the rumours and talks within Carraways social circle before he actually meets the man, and when he/we are introduced to Gatsby, new questions arise.Often quite a romantic novel, F.Scott Fitzgeralds prose is outstanding, though not complicated, or hard to read, every page is filled poetic language, which makes ""The Great Gatsby"" one of the most beautifully written pieces of literature I've ever read. The final sentence haunted me for quite some time after the initial reading and I can most definitely see myself returning to this novel in a few years. Recommended!/M.R."
419,Kacey," The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a fantastic book. I have never read a book by this author before but I really enjoyed this novel and wouldn't mind reading another one of his books. They are really only four main characters, Jay Gatsby, Daisy Fay, Tom Buchanan, and Nick Carraway. This book takes lace on Long Island in New York during 1922. Jay Gatsby lives across from Daisy and her husband Tom, who live beside Nick. Gatsby and Daisy are in love but Daisy has just recently found out that Gatsby lives so close to her. Throughout this book Daisy and Gatsby want to be together but Daisy is married so they have Nick intervene and create situations where daisy and Gatsby can see each other without Tom thinking anything of it. This book teaches you to never stop going after what you want. After all of those years that Gatsby never saw Daisy he still wanted to be with her and he never stopped trying. This book is good for all readers in general but the reader was probably directing it towards people in their 20's because they can probably relate to some of the scenarios that take place in this book. What really makes this book different compared to others is that it kind of keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next through out the whole novel. Another way that it varies from other books is that it has a major unexpected event happen toward the end and in most books the turn of events is some what expected and it’s in the middle of the book. A quote that stands out is when Nick says, ""You're acting like a little boy. Not only that but you're rude. Daisy's sitting in there all alone.""(Fitzgerald, 88) He says this to Gatsby when he leaves Daisy in Nick's living all alone because he was nervous. This shocked me because Nick's character isn't normally that outspoken, he is usually more held back and reserved. Gatsby also always calls Nick ""Old Sport"" so it was shocking when Nick confronted him since Gatsby talks to him as if he is older than Nick. This book appealed to me emotionally because it is sad that Daisy and Gatsby are in love but their lives have just changed so much since they were younger, and now Daisy is married so they can't be together. The end of The Great Gatsby really shocked me! The movie was pretty spot on compared to the book but you just don’t get the same feel of the character’s emotions like you do in the book. I recommend this book to everyone, even if you don't like to read, that's just how good this book really is. "
420,Da,Loved it
421,Raven,"I adored this book.Something about it connected with me, deeply. I'm not sure how it did or how it bit into me so desperately. Somehow it is shadowing me and I can see the darkness that is so deeply woven into this novel. I think, possibly, it is because I can see so much of this is our day today. Look at Justin Beiber. Look at Miley Cyrus (if you can bear to.) What has wealth done for them but destroyed any innocence they had?I guess the connection made within me was the hopelessness of it all.That is all I can say without spoilers. If somehow you haven't read this, please do. It's short but very powerful. There is something everlasting about this novel. I hope you can find it. "
422,Annapurna Holtzapple,"The Great Gatsby	“So we beat on, boats against the current, born back ceaselessly into the past,” (pg 180). The melancholic last line of a dark and poetic novel grips the reader as the lyrical tale of Jay Gatsby, comes to a close. This particular line, of releasing your past and pushing towards the future, is similar to many of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s powerful sentences in The Great Gatsby because it resonates with many people. 	Published in 1925, The Great Gatsby has been regarded as “The American Literature,” because of it’s poetic interpritation of the “American Dream,” and is an international literary classic. The Great Gatsby has been translated into many different languages, 25 million copies sold worldwide, and is recently resurfacing the USA Today’s Best Seller’s List. This story of longing and unrequited love, is appealing to such a wide audience because the beauty of the writing connects to so many people.	 Fitzgerald began writing the novel after visiting a Long Island party in 1923, his goal being to capture “something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned.” Fitzgerald drew from this real-life inspiration and the important setting of this party in this best seller. Based in the intricate society of upper class New York in the roaring twenties, the historical and physical location is crucial to Gatsby’s story. While some of the book takes place in New York City, many of the characters live on two ends of Manhasset Bay, referred to as West Egg and East Egg. Not only seperated physically by a body of water, these two “eggs” are on different positions in the social totem pole. The East Egg, where Daisy and Tom live, was home to “old money” and a prestigious class of atristocrats who are regarded with a higher status. The West Egg, where Jay Gatsby lives, is the “new money,” which is looked down upon by the East Egg. This social divide creates conflict later on, because Gatsby’s new money is shady and deems him unworthy of the socialites of East Egg. During the time, where you came from, and how you got your money was hugely important to status, and social rankings of the time. The Jazz Era is very important to the book, and with the “American Dream” being a prominent them, influences 	This economic division is one of the many factors that holds Jay Gatsby apart for the woman that is madly in love with, Daisy Buchanan, is a member of the elite East Egg. Gatsby is an extremely complicated man, his shady past and sudden rise to great wealth makes him intriguing to both the reader and other characters of the novel. However, despite his complex history; becoming a war hero, mysteriously attaining his fortune, and whether or not he truly is an “Oxford Man,” Gatsby is undeniably in love. He has still been chasing his affections for Daisy even when five years later, she is married and a mother. Gatsby moved across the bay from her, and allowing strangers into his sumptuous home, hoping that one day she would stumble into one of his lavish parties. When Nick Carraway, Daisy’s cousin and classmate of her husband Tom, becomes Gatsby’s next-door-neighbor, it seems that fate is finally in his favor.	The huge events that take place in this intricate plot seem as though they wouldn’t fit in the short, 180 pages of this novel. However, the graceful cadence comfortably encases the twists and turns of the captivating plot. The intense description and vivid details that Fitzgerald uses to paint his novel are beautiful, and creates a leisurely pace of the book. In the beginning, as a reader adjusts to Fitzgerald’s intricate writing, this can make the density of each paragraph difficult to read. However, after becoming accustomed to the writing’s imagery and depth, the power of the character-driven plot is very engaging. Through use of ruminative flash-backs that progress as Nick becomes closer to Gatsby, Fitzgerald develops true human element. These flashbacks are not only crucial to the plot, and understanding how complex Gatsby is, but elaborate on important characters. Each character can become somebody in your own life, and Fitzgerald has truly created real people with depth, and dimension.	The Great Gatsby is a story of longing, decadence, and heartbreak, is set against a dark mood. It is a beautifully written novel, and the description of the age-lavish wealth, classes, shady money-is felt throughout the writing. The presence of Gatsby forever unable to reach Daisy and the heartbreaking extent that he went goes to for her gives the book a sinister feel, this caliginous novel is made intriguing by the beauty of description and detail. "
423,Matteo Wong,"In The Great Gatsby, Scott F. Fitzgerald tells the incredible story of James Gatz, who changes his name to Jay Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby is a rich, successful man in the Roaring Twenties. He is a man who has a deep yearning for more. He has built himself an empire of money, but he is not content with the money on its own. What Jay Gatsby wants to do is use his vast wealth to achieve more. He wants the love of Daisy, the woman of his life. He uses his money to attract her, and to create a veil over himself, a fake persona. In this persona, he is educated, cultured, and adventurous. But, in the end, his need for more kills him, to the dismay of many.I believe that the theme of the Great Gatsby is wanting more, and knowing when to stop. For instance, Daisy and her husband Tom don't want anything. They are so hopelessly bored with their money, they go around, ruining people's lives, and trying to be entertained. Then, on the other side of the spectrum, there is Jay Gatsby. He always wants more, leading to his demise. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it to all readers, for its story, symbolism and depth. This book can be read over and over, and you can learn new things. In the end, it leaves me with one question, what makes Gatsby so great? And thankfully, there is no answer, and it can be pondered over many times."
424,Rahma Djebbari,"“He smiled understandingly-much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to face--the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.” "
425,Adrianne,"The true depth and meaning of this text was lost to me in high school the first time around. After re-reading in college I fell in love with not only Gatsby, and the story, and the allure of the era during which the events take place but also with Fitzgerald's particular use of language and character construction. Taking a deeper look at our narrator Nick and the gaps he leaves in his own story, but manages to fill them with gossipy hearsay about Gatsby, allow us to realize that we will never get the real story; at least not from Nick and that, maybe, Jay Gatsby is the only man we can trust."
426,Caleb Coy,"F. Scott Fizgerald wanted to write a great novel about his time, about the 1920s, about an era that could be summarized by the symbol of a champagne bottle exploding into the night emptying itself hollow with intoxication. You like that? Well, he didn’t use that, but what he did use was a giant, haunting billboard for a long-forgotten oculist (aka eye doctor).This symbol that used to be a sign of a hope for better vision has become a sign that someone is watching you ominously, not like the Big Brother of 1984 who makes you paranoid, but like some sharp deity who sits in judgement of your excesses and the waste it produces. Because this ad hangs over the Valley of Ashes, an inescapable heap of trash where the poor dwell, the rich passing by them every day on their way to the city. This is what the novel is about. It’s not a love story; it’s a tragedy of the false thing called the American Dream and the reckless people who drowned themselves in it. You can only drive by this depression so long: In just a few short years it will find you. You careless wealthy socialites, says Fitzgerald, you make me sick to the heart with your drinking and gossip and philandering and hypocrisy and excess and silly dreams. You have more than what you need but you still yearn for that illusive green light of the next shore, the next big thing, the green-eyed monster inside you hungry for more and never full. You paint your greed with love to make it look virtuous. You get so drunk you don’t know who’s party you’re at and when he dies you call to say you can’t make it to the funeral but you’d like to have your shoes sent over.Oh and it’s also about a dreaming young man who just wants to win back the love of his life. But it seems every time they make a movie version of it, the love story trumps the message. Oh well: It certainly brings more in to the box office.It’s a novel about careless people, as Fitzgerald described them:“They smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.”"
427,All Dolled Up Reviews  (KBR) ,"Now being a fan of the 1920’s how could I not start this feature off with The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. I have to say I am so honored to be writing this review. I mean, it combines everything I love about books; including the fantastic writing of Fitzgerald and the perfectly flawed characters that you love and hate all at the same time.The story of The Great Gatsby follows the life of Jay Gatsby and his undying love for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meets five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. ""Her voice is full of money,"" Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across from Daisy. He throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama; including the detached, cynical neighbor, Nick Carraway, acting as the chorus.The novel the Great Gatsby is probably one of the best books I have ever read. I fell in love with the world Fitzgerald built with his beautifully poetic words. The heartbreak and challenge Jay Gatsby went through to get back the love of his life sealed the deal. If you have not read this wonderful classic I suggest you do. 5 pearls."
428,Nabby,"""The Great Gatsby"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a novel that explores the intricacies of human relationships that are tainted by questionable morality and corruption. The novel takes place in 1922 in New York with a man named Nick Carraway who moves from Minnesota to the affluent West Egg District of Long Island. Nick is a Yale graduate who is sent to New York to learn about bond business. He hears of his mysterious neighbor Jay Gatsby, who owns a beautiful mansion and throws elaborate parties every Saturday evening. Nick's cousin, Daisy Buchanan, also lives within the West Egg District and is married to Tom, who is extremely wealthy and well known within the community. He is also Nick's classmate from Yale. What follows is a series of sorted affairs in which everyone's moral compass is pointed in the wrong direction. This is a love story in which Fitzgerald makes poignantly clear that not all fairytales have happy endings, and that love doesn't necessarily conquer all. I personally enjoyed this novel very much and recommend it to those who are looking for an examination of the painful truths involved in intimate relationships. This unique love story both warms and hurts the heart as the many secrets begin to unfold about people's obvious as opposed to true intentions. All in all, this was a powerful story that kept me thinking about the characters for days after I put the book down. "
429,Homo Sapien,"Amazing descriptive writing that carries actions smoothly at a good pace. The characters are all believable and well thought out. All of them are flawed believably. Nick Carraway had been curious about his neighbor Gatsby for quite a while, a man who threw magnificent parties and stood outside his house and gazed at the stars, alone. When Nick is invited to one of Gatsby's parties, he starts to befriend Gatsby, and thus become entangled in his life. Gatsby fell in love with Daisy before he was sent to war. They fell in love with each other, with promise that he could take care of her, a city girl from a rich family. When Gatsby was sent overseas to fight in the war, he left Daisy with promise to get back to her as soon as possible. Due to complications, Gatsby was sent to Oxford, rather than being sent home, and Daisy married another man, Tom Buchanan. After returning home, Gatsby was penniless, and went into business in order to obtain wealth, and then Daisy. He lived across the bay from her, and for many years dreamed of being with her again. His attempts to take Daisy back from her husband fail as she is unsure of the position it will put her in. As the group returns home, Gatsby and Daisy drive home from New York. A woman unexpectedly runs into the road, and Daisy hits her with Gatsby's car. The woman's husband, George Wilson, finds out that his wife was hit by Gatsby's car, and (view spoiler)[kills Gatsby. Only Nick, Wolfsheim (the man that taught Gatsby business and boarded with him, and one other nameless man attended his funeral. (hide spoiler)]"
430,Raven Bandicoot,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is my absolute favorite book. The writing style captivates me like no other book I've read before, which compels me to read more by the genius mind of Fitzgerald. Anyone looking for a classic that will inevitably stay in history forever, I highly recommend The Great Gatsby. The themes explored in the writing really makes you think about human behaviors. The detail about the rare type of smile that Gatsby makes, the way he reaches toward the light across the bay, the selfish acts by humans, social behaviors, affairs and how Nick, the narrator, describes each of the occurrences he is experiencing by living in the middle of this mess."
431,D,Really dreamy good. One of my most pleasant reading experiences.
432,Eshtiaq ,"The Great Gatspy is the simplest yet deepest book ever . I don't get why people talk about how shallow the characters are , I think they just didn't dive enough into the book to get them ! . This book flows beautifully and unfold smoothly in a such enchanted way . And yes I hate daisy sooooo much ! God she is so annoying and dumb and I do hate that Gatspy was in love with her ! I mean he deserve better ! She definitely is a total match to Tom ! Both annoying . the ending just breaks me in so many levels , from the death scene to the empty funeral, the world is just unfair . "
433,Sara ,"I listened to The Great Gatsby on audio. I had never read the book itself, although I'd seen the movie and read some short stories that were probably a basis for it. I had liked these versions and was glad I listened to the book too. It's a tragic tale, but so romantic in its melancholy. The Great Gatsby is a classic for a reason. It's about the American Dream, and the problematic nature thereof (10 points for using the word ""problematic"" outside of an academic setting!!) Gatsby represents the dream of coming up from obscure, humble beginnings, reinventing yourself, and ""making it"" in the world. But there are cracks in the facade, you can see right away. Here are a few of the ways in which the American Dream isn't quite working for Gatsby. Although it seems like he was a driven, hard worker as a young man, Gatsby seems to have built at least some of his wealth through shady dealings and probably bootlegging. Maybe hard work wasn't enough to raise him to the status he so desired. At any rate, his success is at least a little tainted. And his life has an emptiness to it, as evidenced by the end of the book. He is surrounded by rather vacant people, most of whom just want something from him. And then there's the fact that, as the narrator Nick's last few lines indicate, the dream Gatsby's chasing is not really a dream of the future, but rather the dream of another timeline in which the idealized past is carried out to its fullest potentialities. But for me, what's compelling about this story is the deeply romantic part of it. Daisy was an unworthy object of affection, but Gatsby loved her so much that he built his whole life around her. He bought a mansion and threw parties all the time, hoping that Daisy would come. He always seemed out of it distracted by the real world, especially when he was around Daisy, because he was so focused on her. He really did sacrifice everything for her. This sort of obsession isn't realistic or healthy, but...sigh. Sigh. So tragically romantic. A note on the audio version: the audio reader really puts the scorn in Nick's voice. The narrator of the story is Gatsby's neighbor Nick, who seems to (rather justifiably) look down on the people around him--but I might have overlooked some of the bitter tone if I was reading rather than listening. A note on ennui: I have a long list of ideas for what people with unlimited time and money could be doing (other than driving like idiots). No need to be bored when you can cruise the Greek Isles, learn Swedish, volunteer, train for a Himalayan trek... Alas, Daisy and her circle never consulted me. Another note, after watching the new version of the movie: What a wonderful portrait of obsession. And also of a particular feeling, which I imagine most adults have felt at one time or another. It's the feeling you get when something you've longed for, worked for, obsessed over, and gotten so close to achieving that you can almost taste it...is snatched away. So good. "
434,James,"I found Gatsby to be a very entertaining read, with thought-provoking undertones in spite of not having a particularly captivating plot. I've heard many people criticize the novel for lacking a centre or substance, and I do agree with them insofar as it does lack those things, but I do not think it suffers from it. If a novel is typically a direct route through a designated series of places to an absolute ending, then Gatsby is a leisurely meander from place to place, eventually leading you to somewhere you didn't know you were going but are quite happy to be.It's a curious feature of the story that every main character is at least fairly interesting and developed, except Nick, the narrator. Indeed, it could even be said that Nick isn't really a main character in the story at all. Fitzgerald portrays the story through his eyes, and yet whilst giving him his own reflections and opinions on the events of the novel, it's almost inevitable to the reader that they are to be treated with total disregard. Nick simply does not matter, he just happens to be there. In retrospect, that was a very liberating aspect of the book, for me - I found myself able to follow a limited-perspective story without being attached particularly to the person whose perspective that was.It would be hard to put a finger on why I've rated Gatsby so highly. You'd never become angry over it, you'd never be enthused by it, and you'd never cry over it. What it gives is simply a reflection on life. It's a scenario - a contrived, extraordinary scenario, to be sure - but a scenario within the life of the time of writing, and a chance to watch it play out over a few months with just the right nudges at just the right times that maybe this or that is worth thinking more deeply about, and maybe, if you really did think, it doesn't make as much sense as you thought."
435,Alice,"what I consider to be a story of ultimate betrayal. beautifully written in a way that it reads as a love story, until a fateful twist reveals select characters true identites. even though gatsby's decade-long infatuation with daisy was revealed to be slightly more obsessive and creepy than romantic, you feel nothing but sympathy for the poor guy, he truly loved her. she truly loved herself. i see daisy as the villain of the story (assuming this story has one). tom could be in the running for the title but he is depicted as being somewhat rotten from the get go. daisy is manipulative and selfish, her actions and behaviour ultimately costing a innocent man (the one she ""loved""). she focuses solely on the survival of herself, not her daughter, someone she was willing to abandon for a lavish life with gatsby, not her husband; whom she only married for the money and fame. she didn't plan gatsby's death but she did throw him under the bus! she knew she'd get away with it, what with gatsby's shady past and all. a classic that will never get old."
436,Lane Ward,"Wow.I can't fully express how beautiful the writing is in this book. Not a word is wasted. And in so few words Fitzgerald is able to paint scenes with so much detail.Reads quickly, effortlessly, smoothly, with writing that makes you feel like you've known characters their entire lives only 7 pages in.I especially love the first chapter. So much said in even single sentences.""Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egoism no longer nourished his peremptory heart."" Of Tom."""" and too many to even get into of the narrator, Nick, whose thoughts read so genuinely. I feel like I have known him many years, that I am him, as we travel through this story.Beautiful.I'm not sure how fully a younger me would have appreciated this book, I may even have disliked it, but I know that I think it is excellent now."
437,Claudia,"After reading Hemingway's version of the famous friendship, I knew I needed to reread this. I think every time I read it, it means more to me. With the perspective of Hemingway's voice, I see why he hated Zelda so...he does say he believes Zelda was jealous of Fitzgerald's talent. I think Hemingway recognized the towering talent he saw. This book, published before their friendship began, provides a breathtaking contrast to Hemingway's first novel, also on my summer reads: THE SUN ALSO RISES. While Hemingway was working to invent a new narrative, spare, lean, Fitzgerald SEEMS to be effortless here. Having read a book that included the exchanges between FSF and his publisher, I am very aware of the craft that went into the book, but it feels so different. I still love Nick, and see him even more as the outsider...Daisy is not worth the time and angst Jay Gatsby's spent on her. Jordan and Tom are unlikeable...and the Wilsons? Pathetic.I saw the accident in a new light...lots of undertones of what's done and said. And only Tom and Daisy walk away, unscathed. Blech. What a genius stroke to have the accident happen out of Nick's presence...so he and we have to struggle with the truth.I was saddened by the end: the lonely funeral, Jimmy's eager dreams to be someone important, the heartbroken father. There's a paragraph at the end that ends up being horribly prophetic: ""They were careless people, tom and Daisy -- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made..."" NOT a paragraph! An amazing sentence. This IS Scott and Zelda. Written at the beginning of their marriage...they were hideously careless. With their relationship, their child, their talents.It's ironic that Fitzgerald used his own love story with Zelda as the basis of Jay's and Daisy's meeting, considering the parallels I see to Daisy and Tom in their lives after the publication of the book.But the story stands on its own...The green light, the eyeglasses, the valley of ashes. I can remember the first time I read that, imagining the industrial wasteland of N. Indiana as a Valley of Ashes..."
438,Julie,Surprisingly contemporary considering the era it was written. Beautifully done and a definite good read!
439,Jim Moriarty,"Profoundly fascinating. The first time I read this book was in my High school English class. Skimming through its meager 180 pages I quickly dismissed it as thoroughly boring, with overtly stupid and annoying characters as well as a fairly unsatisfactory plot. However, while reading through I couldn't help but feel as if I was missing something, as if there was some subtext that I couldn't quite grasp. Looking back, I can see that I was at least aware of something going on besides what was obvious, I simply didn't dig enough to see it.The second time that I read this book was again in High school, and when I learned that I had to repeat the past experience of undying boredom yet again I struggled to suppress a groan. Fortunately for me and my understanding, I had a better teacher this time and she forced the class to look deeper than the simple aesthetics. Upon finishing the book for the second time, I was conflicted. But after allowing the dust to settle I think that I can truly say that this is perhaps the most well written book that I have ever read, as well as the book with the most depth. I can't quite call it my favorite, but it is hard to ignore the profound strength that bolsters up this book's foundations. First to go over, the language. This book is written absolutely beautifully, and the genius behind it is evident in nearly every line. It almost drips poetry, and while reading it I almost struggle to keep myself from being swept away in its genius and scope. Second, the meaning. As I said earlier, when I first read this book I only read as far as the apparent meaning. If I'm honest with myself, the books I often read don't need to be read beyond a superficial glance, but this book requires a more studious reading style. You can't simply gloss over the passages and see the obvious, you have to puzzle it out, think through what Fitzgerald is trying to say. This book is the perfect example of showing, not telling, and this is apparent in every syllable. So, dig a little deeper. As hard as it often can be, the result is so completely worth it. Upon my second reading the teacher told the class that every sentence within this book had at least two meanings. Although I was not looking for it, I wouldn't be in the least bit surprised to find that this is true. Third, the symbolism. This almost is a subset to my second point about this book, but for the sake of organization I'll keep it separate. This book is simply loaded with symbolism, and when this is applied, the already double meaning triples. It goes beyond simple characters, and instead conveys themes, ideas, and contradictions, all couched in some of the most sparkling language written. Fourth, the actual characters. The first time I read this book I found myself hating the primary characters with a passion. I could not stand their indolence, their sheer capacity for apathy. They were despicable, and I hated reading about them. At the time I ignored the fact that in many ways these characters represented some of my own attributes, and preferred to hate in simple incomprehension. Later on, I began to realize the characters complexity. Daisy's facade of stupidity, Tom's bullish and hypocritical nature, Gatsby's propensity for hope, and total commitment to a single dream. All of this remarkable detail is layered into these characters in only 180 pages. It truly is remarkable. Then, when you add the aforementioned symbolism these characters take on yet another aspect, and go even further with the meaning of the book. I realize now that you don't have to have likable characters to have a good book. I can no longer ignore how profoundly remarkable this book is. It stands alone, unmatched in sheer depth by any author I care to name (except perhaps Shakespeare, but even then). I hope that you will find its depths even greater, and more expansive than I did."
440,Arka Gupta,"It was summer 2010, I was 20 years old, deeply in love with a girl and about that time got a copy of this book from the Library. I'm still not exactly sure because I was so deep in love or the book was a sheer genius itself, I read it for 5 times straight. Yes, for 2 months, I didn't read any other books but this one and to be honest, this story will forever be niggling inside me. Why? Here's why- I not only read the story and totally loved it, I felt the story as a part of me. Fitzgerald makes me care about the story, but not the people. Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, Jordan are not people I could truly like. They didn't want me to. They succeed. Even Nick, my narrator, is simply my surrogate to describe what is happening. It's of course a well told story of desires, dreams and disaster woven into the fabric of many lives. It is like standing on the edge of a great abyss about to open. We know it's going to happen though we may not know how. Such grandiose dreams and unrealistic expectations covering depths of fear and despair can have no other outcome. Not in literature. People can be so lonely, empty, and inward that they never can find what they truly want and keep pushing it away even as they rush headlong toward it. Gatsby, the great, will forever be one of the tragic character ever portrayed successfully. Which is why it was so compelling. Human nature, when taken over by such desires and thoughtless directions, hasn't changed. Nick may long for the quieter life of the Midwestern heartland, but we know he won't find it. That can be as much of a false ideal as the mansions on Long Island Sound that trapped Gatsby.A solid 5 stars, a must read classic. "
441,Luciana Darce,"Acho que a culpa foi mais da curiosidade que fiquei de conhecer o Fitzgerald depois de assistir Meia-Noite em Paris. Eu nunca tinha lido nenhum dos livros dele, não conhecia seu estilo nem nada do tipo, nem mesmo visto qualquer das adaptações para o cinema.Enfim, seja quais foram os motivos que me levaram a escolher esse título, eu não me arrependo. Tampouco demorou muito para entender o porquê da escolha dele como espelho do “breve século XX” – nas palavras do já saudoso Hobsbawn. Tudo acontece muito rápido, sem sentido, taças de champagne, mentes embotadas, velocidade, traição, jóias, miséria, sonhos, desilusões... Exceto pelo narrador e por Gatsby – fascinante-do-começo-ao-fim-Gatsby – ninguém na história parece ter um plano de vida, ou importar-se com alguma coisa além de seu próprio prazer.O mundo de O Grande Gatsby é um mundo de futilidades, espelhos e fumaça. Um mundo de hedonistas. De longe, cheio de cores e luzes brilhantes, ‘a vida é uma festa’, orquestras de jazz e o álcool para encobrir as marcas da Grande Depressão.É o jardim da casa de Gatsby visto da janela de Nick, uma festa que nunca termina.Ou que se apaga dolorosamente quando findam as ilusões. É difícil entender o amor de Gatsby por Dayse, a forma como ele move céus e terras para terminar do outro lado da baía, morando defronte a ela, observando a luz verde do embarcadouro. Tudo para se aproximar da sombra de uma mulher que ele acredita amar – e que ao final não passa exatamente disso: uma sombra.Melancólica, cética, amarga... eu nem sei que adjetivos mais colocar aqui. Mas o que é mais interessante é que a despeito de seu uma história desesperançada, de não haver nada de extraordinário nos encontros e desencontros dos homens e mulheres que passeiam pela narrativa... o livro é extraordinário. A linguagem de Fitzgerald é precisa e elegante – em muitos pontos, lembrou-me o estilo de Austen -, consegue criar uma imagística forte com uma concisão que você não está acostumado a ver hoje em dia. Ele te prende, te fascina. Faz com que você mergulhe completamente naquele mundo – você escuta os acordes do jazz, sente o champagne fazer cócegas na língua, e é hipnotizado pelo brilho que esconde toda a corrupção que está por trás de tudo aquilo.É um encantamento. Fitzgerald te enfeitiça com suas palavras. E é bastante possível que você acaba retornando a ele para mais dessa magia. Belos e malditos – usando outro de seus títulos – eis o que é O Grande Gatsby."
442,Liza,"I admit, when I was in high school I hated this book. I thought Gatsby was boring, I didn't understand the point of view of the narrator, and found Daisy and the rest of that ""bunch"" to be far removed from reality. It was utterly ridiculous to me. My teacher, all she could do was rave about the novel, which made me hate it more.I didn't get it!Fast forward a decade later and I am reading this novel again as a possible contender for my Pre AP classes. I don't know if my students will like it. They might even hate it, however, I get it now.The Great Gatsby, I think, is a book that can only be appreciated if you have experienced the highs and lows of life. I don't mean this to assault the sensibilities of teens and the college crowd, but the very thing people rail against is what makes this book so appealing.I think in this current culture where we celebrate excess, success, wealth, and celebrity, The Great Gatsby is more relevant than ever. I don't believe I could have ever understood Jay's motivation to go after such a wicked vile person such as Daisy at 16, 21, even 25 as it clearly is a lost cause. (Age doesn't affect that bit of common sense.)However, what age and experience can give you is the understanding of what it's like to reach after goals and fail at the very things you felt would define you. When you're young and the world is your oyster all it seems like is whining, which at times that's all that Daisy does. Yet, when I read it I understood Jay's desire to want to fit into a new social class and the struggle and pains it takes to break into a new economic class. There is something to be said of the shallow friendships that Jay cultivated and how no one stood behind in the end, except for Nick. I think you have to have lost a few friends, and fought with a few friends along the way to really see how depressing and unnerving the ending can be. More important, if I had never experienced a loss, I don't think this book could have ever appealed to me. That loss could be in the form of a loved one, a dream, or some other abstract quality that is significant to you, but without it, this novel is just about selfish people who party all the time, while a poser tries to sneak his way in to win the heart of a floozy.The fact that he captured elements of the Jazz era and the roaring twenties was simply a bonus. I don't think this novel could have worked out well had it been longer. If you think about it the novel's length matches the brevity and quick rise and fall of Gatsby himself. I love this book, but I would just suggest to those that abhor this novel to wait a few years. If you've dealt with fraud, betrayal, or the loss of a dream, this novel can speak volumes to you, that in no way can you relate to as a 16-21 year old. The most I would expect my students to get out of this is how excess and wealth has this corruptible element. Gatsby constantly wants to repeat history and you know that his desires are unrealistic, but you are still rooting for him until the very end, because everyone has had one Gatsby moment in their life. Where they continue to pursue after something or someone when it is a lost cause. He hasn't let go of his dream and because of that reluctance a part of me was able to relate to him. I've been there, done that, and thankfully did not end up where Gatsby is. "
443,Steven,"The first time I was supposd to read it... I didn't. I skim-read it and wrote a report on what looked like a totally boring book to me in high school. (Nevertheless, I got an ""A"" on the report!) The second time I read it, thanks to seeing the role of Gatsby played by Robert Redford, I sort- of- kind- of enjoyed it but wasn't blown away. For some reason I decided to give it another shot a few weeks ago even though I wasn't compelled to see the movie remake. Bingo!! This time I got a real sense of its greatness. The writing is, in many passages, sensual and sublime. The characters are well-drawn, and I actually felt the emotion of the book. Maybe Fitzgerald ached for the girl of his dreams he once knew in the past, the girl who would be lost to him due to mental illness, and the cruel necessity of institutionalization. Perhaps he was deeply lonely, and drank to deal with that and his grief over his wife's illness. If only he could know that years later his book would be this successful classic, proving the sad truth in the melancholic theme of the book: life comes with no Rewind button; it only has a Pause (time to reflect and, all too often, to regret)and an insistent Forward button. I was very moved by this book and glad that I took the time to re-read it again, for the reward of doing so was great. I also happen to think the cover of this version is just plain hot. I've read Tender is the Night; think I will check out The Beautiful and Damned next, now that I'm a bona fide Fitzgerald fan."
444,Taylor Macpherson,"I never did a review of The Great Gatsby even though it is by far my favourite classic. I think one of the things Fitzgerald does so incredibly well is not only use his characters to tell the story but have them symbolize his message and theme. The amount of symbolism and use literary devices in this novel is enough to make any English major drool, and it's one of the reasons I was so drawn to this tale in the first place. Gatsby is such an idealistic character initially, he instantly becomes your hero, the good guy, the one to root for. Gatsby is not just the protagonist, he represents the message of this story the corruption of the American dream. He represents the greedy scramble for wealth in those times, and he loses sight of the original dream in his bid to win Daisy's affection. The Great Gatsby is heart wrenching and sincere, and Fitzgerald cleverly depicts the era in such a wonderful way. This book is a must read."
445,Jacque,"A highly symbolic novel of social times. (I had also read it when I was younger.) It was great for parent/teen discussion, especially after my kids had read it for school. My kids and I also saw the DiCaprio movie and absolutely loved it. Technically great filming and artistically it captured the intent of the book. It would have been really great had the author been alive to see it and comment! I had watched the older Redford movie hears ago and it did not move me, nor did my kids like it as much."
446,Ishaan Sood,"A tragic romance blended with extravagance of American society in Jazz age, the work offers a one-way entrance to the mesmerizing world of Gatsby. One-way as it becomes hard to leave, once caught in the dazzle. So much to offer apart from an engaging plot and interesting characters- the prohibition-era American lifestyle, rise of the new, uneducated rich, loosening scruples in the age of money; this is certainly more than just a novel- it’s a window that reflects the past and quickly sucks in the unsuspecting reader. Before you know it, you are in Gatsby’s house enjoying the exuberant Saturday evening, while the whole charade falls apart in front of your eyes and surprisingly, you don’t feel anything for poor Gatsby. Somewhere in your heart, he had it coming- ‘paid a high price for living too long a single dream’. It’s the survivors who are the real victims- Nick, Mr. Gatz, Daisy, Tom and we, the readers- they deserve our best sympathy. Enough for the plot though, the books has something in store for everyone. I was fascinated with the discovery of roots of proverbial tectonic shift in American culture through this book. It showcases an era with the craft of a genius. The eyes of Dr. Eckleburg symbolize the reader who, immobilized, watches the whole corruption, glamour and folly of an age. I was drawn into 1920s New York life, despite being miles and years away. The book deserves to be read atleast twice, once for the plot and next for the magic."
447,Naleen,"After reading The Scarlet Letter in high school (and hating every symbol filled minute of it!), The Great Gatsby was a breath of fresh air. It made me (and many of my fellow classmates) really appreciate classic literature in a way that other books we had been forced to read couldn't. I am older now, and sometimes wiser (though not always) and am slowly going back and re-reading all those classics. The Great Gatsby didn't disappoint the second time around either! Though I disliked many of the characters a lot more now than I remember disliking them in high school..."
448,Mariam Abood,"This book is one of my all time favourite classics, and I feel this book is definitely my favourite modernist classic, which is why I was thrilled to discover I would be studying it for A-level. Usually studying books at school makes people hate the book, but in this case I actually ended up loving this book, because I got to really analyse and pull apart one of my favourite books, making me have a way more in depth knowledge of this book. On the surface this looks like a book I honestly thought I wouldn't like, because in essence it's a book about a bunch of spoilt rich people, who know they're spoilt and rich, who waste their life partying. And honestly, who wants to read that?However, once you read this book you soon discover that actually, this is a tragic book about society, sacrifice and morality. Fitzgerald purposefully wrote a book where every single character, bar the peripheral narrator Nick, is incredibly dislikeable with few redeeming qualities, as a way of being able to portray the morality of the upper classes, and how apathetic they were to the issues within their society. This was complemented by a blend of romance, and an insight into discrimination. What I thought really stood out for me about this book, was the stunning character development within this book. Take Daisy for example. When I first read this book, I honestly thought Daisy was a character I was going to like. I knew Daisy was ditsy, but I felt as if Daisy acted ditsy because she knew where she stood in her society, because when she describes her daughter she notes how 
“I hope she'll be a fool -- that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.” 
 From this quote we realise that Daisy is an intelligent character, because she is aware of the fact that intelligence in women is not valued in her society. Looking beautiful however, is.Consequently, from reading this, I honestly thought Daisy was a character I was going to like. However, then I got to chapter 8 and all I'm going to say on the matter is, you are going to be in for a world of pain. I have never seen such a dramatic change in a character, that actually was really obvious. After reading this book, it left me thinking about other characters in books, and how actually their minor flaws, may secretly make up their entire personality.And that is why I loved this book, because this book made me change my outlook on other books, because this book made me think about characters differently, and in a way, changed the way I read. And that's why I gave this book 5 stars. Because, this book was powerful, and changed everything."
449,Bigyellowtaxi1,"So I was rewatching some of John Green's old YouTube videos because I adore him and the man has never had an ineloquent thought it his life. He ended one with some non-rhetorical questions about Gatsby:1. Is Gatsby a hero? To what extent can his quest be called heroic?2. Is your quest heroic?1. Is Gatsby a hero? Is his quest heroic?As a student of ancient history to me the word 'hero' always has Homeric connotations. For Homer a hero is generally somebody of royal or divine descent, Gatsby however is ""Mister Nobody from Nowhere"" so he fails in that regard. Homer's heroes are generals of great armies and kings or princes of states, but Gatsby can hardly be called a leader of men. Though his parties are always popular, none of his guests know him and none of them are loyal to him at his end. How about a special relationship with the gods then? The gods of Olympus always assisted their favourites, but though the eyes of Dr TJ Eckleburg look on they can do nothing for Gatsby. Without arms and legs they cannot protect him, even if they wanted to. But Homer's heroes generally have their own niche area of excellence, for Odysseus it was his cunning, for Achilles his swiftness of foot and only here can Gatsby compare to the heroic model, he does have his own special skill, his ""extraordinary gift for hope"".I think at its heart, The Great Gatsby is the story of an unheroic age. Heroes don't exist in this novel, only victims.2. Is your quest heroic?If I have learnt anything from Gatsby it's that quests are inevitably futile. There are really only two possible outcomes, firstly they may go unachieved. But secondly, and perhaps more disappointingly, they can be concluded. The secret then is not to stop trying, but to choose what we care about. We all have our green lights that we reach for, but we should make sure that our objects are ultimately worthy of our efforts."
450,Irene McHugh,"I had never read the classic The Great Gatsby and I’ve been delaying watching any movie version of the story until I did sit down and read it. Unlike most of my other reviews, this one contains spoilers. I am just so disgusted by this story that I could not write anything that was neutral and spoiler-free.Surprisingly, I read this novel much quicker than I thought I would. The pacing worked well. Fitzgerald camouflages most of his self-absorbed, superficial, and judgmental characters well in the first half of the story. Of course, I knew from popular references to the story that things would not end well, but I was hoping for some glimmer of hope.The majority of this story focuses on Nick Carraway’s observations about his neighbor Jay Gatsby. Nick is the one dynamic character in this entire plot.All of the other characters are such horrifyingly static characters void of any moral center. The most vile of these characters is Daisy Buchanan. She is the beautiful, but brainless female seeking the Mrs. degree. She found her rich husband in the philandering Tom Buchanan. The fact that she is raising a child makes me sick. She is completely devoid of any conscience, proven when she runs over her husband’s lover, Myrtle, and leaves the scene of the accident. This working class woman is of no consequence to Daisy. Myrtle is just some commoner; her life worthless.Then there’s Jordan Baker, the single version of Daisy, spending her time husband hunting. I was relieved when Nick Carraway escaped her advances. His decision to leave the heartless city and reconnect with the real people in his life actually creates a somewhat promising resolution to an otherwise depressing story.This story overflows with the themes of excess consumerism, greed, and the death of the American Dream, which overwhelm me with melancholy. I may not like these themes, but Fitzgerald writes them beautifully and effectively. I am thoroughly and completely depressed and vexed.At the very least, if I wish to extend this morose mood, I can now watch various film versions of the story."
451,Paul Donahue,"Best book ever?Every page has multiple sentences that are simply awe-inspiring. The tension that is batted around among Nick, Gatsby, Daisy, Tom and Jordan is gripping. The final chapter might be my favorite passage of fiction of all time, just stunning.Semi spoilers...It's amazing, at the end of the book, to compare the real Gatsby with the one presented at the beginning of the book. There's never one instance in which Fitzgerald fully spells out who he truly is, but rather you must put together the puzzle that is the real Gatsby, the pieces of which have been strewn all over the preceding pages. At some point you have a less-angry Sally Field moment when she realizes the zany Mrs. Doubtfire is actually [spoilers!!!!!!!!] her zany husband Robin Williams....""Oh my God...Oh my GOD!...OH MY GOD!...The whole time you...the WHOLE TIME...THE WHOLE TIME!!!!!"" It's one of my favorite parts of the movie, with each burst you can see Sally Field remembering yet another event or admission she made to Mrs. Doubtfire that she successively realizes was with her ex-husband.It's not very fitting to give a full paragraph to Mrs. Doubtfire in a review about the Great Gatsby, but whatever. By the end of the book you're thinking back to those parties, his time in the war, the legendary reach for Daisy's dock, all from a completely new perspective.Also, I may be late to the game on this, but the 1920s (not the 90s) were the peak of America, right? We had just kicked some German ass -- and were still earning global adoration for defending against aggressive warmongers, and not the complete opposite. We had emerged as the industrial and innovative world leader, and could actually drive around in motorized vehicles. Medical advancements escorted us out of an age in which people consistently lived or died based on how cold it was outside. We passed women's suffrage, encouraging flappers and the advent of a revolution in female clothing that would eventually lead to miniskirts, bikinis, and pretty much a universal acceptance of exposed cleavage. Prohibition happened, but booze was still widely available and it in turn inspired social drinking, international cruises, car racing, and interstate crime organization (which in turn produced the Godfather and other badass movies). Short of admittedly awesome technological advancements, we had everything then that we could possibly want today, while remaining blissfully ignorant of impending troubles like a silly depression and another trifling world war. (yes i'm aware of the irony here)To put it another way, my previous top 3 list of ""Places/Times You'd Choose To Live In If You Could Pick"" goes 1) Renaissance Italy; 2) the US or UK in the 1960s; and 3) Philadelphia in 1787. #3 is hereby surpassed by ""Nick Carraway in the Great Gatsby,"" not foremost because I'd probably die of yellow fever immediately in option 3."
452,Romain,"I really don't know what to say about this book, except that i didn't know i would adore it so much. i mean i had an extraordinary gift for hope -ha, ha- considering i'm really a big fan of modernist literature and a lot of the things that came from the brains of the guys (and girls) from that time, BUT, still!it is quite dificult to review your favourite-something so i will remain short.i will sound annoying but god, this writing! it may be one of the best i will ever read (yes, this much) it is so beautiful and scotty-scott has this perfect way to combine the romanticist and the modern, and everything, and fuck yeah. he writes truth and in a pure way.what else? incredible characters, metaphors and prettily crafted plot. that is it. read it.c'est un livre au scalpel. un haiku deguisé en roman.ok j'arrete.also, think i loved this book this much also because i used to study and analyze it at university.p.s. watch john green's videos about the book, pretty much sum up the thing."
453,Tina,Fantastic! I loved this classic and for 99 cents for the kindle version on amazon.com - what a treasure. 
454,Jaden Dunn,"The great gatsby is another great book with a great meaning in it as well. This book was about these groups of people living on east and west egg. This book had a lot of conflicts well basically everyone was lying and cheating on their wives and something happened where george had killed gatsby for something that he was set up for. This book is probably my favorite book that i've read just because it has so many different meanings in it. This book was actually pretty similar to the movie and they both told the story very well. ALthough the book had a lot more details whenever they hit her with the car. And the movie didn't show it very well. This book was a great book because while i was reading it there were so many times, that i was just like ""wow, did that just really happen"". Like how everything in this is kind of just one big lie. This book was well written, although at some times it was kind of heard to comprehend. But other than that this book was such a good book. I would definitely recommend this book to all the people who like reading books in general. This book is just a classic."
455,Wei Cho,"One of the greatest American novel. When I first started reading, I was struck by the compelling and descriptive style of writing. It was intellectual prose loaded with imagery and metaphor. At times, I felt there was too much description, and I thought the protagonists were crazy. Just a bit.The characters were quirky. I honestly did not understand Jay Gatsby attachment to Daisy. I know it was love at first sight, and he never got over her from the first time they met. They found each other again some time later to rekindle their love, knowing it's wrong. Nick makes it the more accessible for both. I was starting to feel sorry for Tom Buchanan (even though he's a jerk that has an affair with another girl and is so open about it). This love plot disgusts me, and ironically, that is what makes it so good, so humane, and so complex. The first two-thirds of the book was really slow, and everything started to get interesting during the last third of the book. A most shocking and unexpected twist. I was on the verge of tears when that incident happened. Everything I could say in my mind was,""She didn't deserve him, she didn't deserve him.""It was a sad ending, nobody really got what they wanted in the end. Everything was made out of love, and even that wasn't strong enough.I felt the book was very hard to read because of the long, almost unending blocks of description. The dialogue between the characters were about vague topics which they never cleared up but left it as an inside joke. Most of the times, I had to guess what had happened.It was a very powerful final third, written with great quality of writing. I would recommend this book. It requires patience, understanding, and meticulous reading, but a good read nonetheless.Favorite quote:He must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. "
456,Tink,"They were careless people, Tom and Daisy."
457,Alisha Ali,"This book is AMAZING! The character of Gatsby is nothing but great among the likes of Daisy and Tom Buchanan.Can't wait for the film, it is too perfectly casted. "
458,Kile Kelly,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a narrative set back in the early 1900’s, surrounding Nick, the main character, and his life in West Egg, New York. Nick comes from a rich background and presents himself as a very moral and tolerant person. He moves to West Egg, New York into a large house next to very wealthy neighbors, one of which being Gatsby. Throughout the book, Nick observes Gatsby as he attempts to reacquaint himself with his past and encounters obstacles along the way. Gatsby is a wealthy man who is in love with a woman who is already married, named Daisy. Daisy is married to Tom, who is friends with Nick. When Nick visits Tom and Daisy, he meets Jordan who he eventually dates. Anyway, Gatsby throws enormous parties frequently that attract all of the important people in the state. He hopes that Daisy will attend one of these parties, but she never does, so Gatsby asks Nick to arrange tea with her so he can join unexpectedly and talk to her. He is scared to talk to her face-to-face because he doesn’t know if she’ll reject him. By using this method though, Daisy is forced to talk to him. Nick reacquaints them and they fall back in love with each other. Although, when Tom realizes that Gatsby and Daisy like each other, he confronts Gatsby and they argue. Gatsby leaves the argument with Daisy, but on his way home they run over Tom’s mistress, Myrtle. Tom does not pursue them because he knows that Myrtle was cheating on her husband with him, and reluctantly takes Daisy back. Myrtle’s husband finds out that Gatsby and Daisy had killed his wife so he finds Gatsby at his house and kills him, and himself. Gatsby was not actually driving the car and Wilson (Myrtle’s husband) thinks that Gatsby is the one who his was wife was cheating with. Therefore, Gatsby is blamed and ultimately killed for events that weren’t his fault. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it made me think even after I had finished it. Although the read was difficult, I learned a ton of new words and the meaning was still crystal clear. The Great Gatsby is definitely one of my new favorite books. The essential question that I used was “Can we escape our past?” which was a major theme in The Great Gatsby. It was extremely evident in Gatsby’s life, especially in the aspects of love and wealth. Gatsby couldn’t let Daisy out of his life and he made major life decisions to be near here. In chapter four, Jordan talks about Gatsby. “’Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay’” (78). Gatsby makes decisions based around his inability to let go of his past. He is still in love with a girl that got married the day after he left for war. This is a prime example of how people cannot escape their past and in chapter six, Gatsby and Nick talk about Gatsby’s dream. 	“’I wouldn’t ask too much of her,’ I ventured. ‘You can’t repeat the past.’	“’Can’t repeat the past?’ he cried incredulously. ‘Why of course you can!’” (110)Gatsby has lived so luxuriously that he has become out of touch with reality; exclusively the reality that he cannot repeat his past. At the very end of the book, Nick touches on what he learned of human nature over the course of these events. 	“Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter--- to-morrow we will run faster, stretch our arms farther….And one fine morning---.	So we beat on, Boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past” (180).This is my favorite passage from the book because it talks about a person’s inability to escape their past. It talks about how people define their lives in a single moment and try to hold on to that moment forever, even when they know it’s gone. "

460,Jeannie Walker,"In my younger years my dad gave me some good advice. ""When you feel like criticizing anyone, put yourself in their circumstances first.""I never saw my grandmother, but I'm supposed to look like her. I had a rich uncle, who lived near the rich and famous, but he didn't live in a mansion like the Gatsby's. However, like Nick carraway, the narrator in this novel, I was awestruck by the wealth, my uncle's way of life and the rich and famous.I loved the movie that was based on this novel, and found the book to be delightful reading. F. Scott Fitzgerald did a great job of bringing to life the characters in his novel and making them have flaws like everyone has from time to time. I have heard the jazz age was a wonderful time in lots of ways and this novel brings the way of that world into our minds, hearts and fascination. I imagine our lives would be very mundane without great writers like this. I hope everyone explores this classic tale.Jeannie Walker Award Winning Author of ""Fighting the Devil"" - A True Story of Consuming Passion, Deadly Poison, and Murder"
461,Jen Six,"The Great Gatsby. Aw yes, the book I read in AP English that had me totally thinking of the jazz age and people dancing drunk in fountains. F. Scott Fitzgerald lived during the golden age and basically ridiculed his fellow man on how they were living their lives. The novels is about our narrator and his cousin Daisy, but mainly about Gatsby, who once loved Daisy and by chance is still totally in love with her and spent the rest of his life trying to win her. He made massive amounts of money because when they were young, he was too poor to marry. But even when Gatsby makes his millions and owns a home as fine as her husband's things just don't work out for poor Gatsby. It's a tragic novel. It's a great novel. Tons of symbolism and tons of hidden meanings that Fitzgerald tried to convey to his audience that isn't that hard to get. A great read, worth it's weight. As well, if you need to cheat to catch your interest, there is a movie version with Robert Redford playing Gatsby and he doesn't do a bad job."
462,Chris,"The thing I most liked in this novel was Nick's assessment of growing into his thirties, still a single man in a culture in which the expectation is to marry and have a family. That he will have a shrinking base of men to associate with and that he can less afford to fantasize about what the future will hold has been something I myself have thought a great deal about, when in the same position.Gatsby himself never let go of the fantasy, and therefore, remains sad and unrealistic throughout. That he has not given up by the end of the novel is terribly sad. It is obvious that nothing is going to work out the way he had hoped, but he can not give up his ideal vision. In fact, he has worked his entire life towards attaining a goal that is lost to him from early on. This particular play on the difference between classes is quite sad. That the characters feel they have no choice but to maintain their inadequate relationships in order to keep up appearances seems to be the antithesis to the way America has envisioned itself, but is engrained in the way those in the Long Island neighborhoods that act as the novel's setting exist."
463,Jessica Arends,"The Great Gatsby is wonderful novel written magnificently by F. Scott Fitzgerald. I really liked the story line of this book and the many different controversies that were happening throughout. One thing I loved is that you aren’t told the story about Gatsby by Gatsby himself. You are told the story through Nick Carraway, Gatsby’s close friend who he meets at one of his lavish Long Island parties. I like the fact that the story is told from Nick’s perspective because it gives the reader a lot of insight into Gatsby’s life but also an insight into the lives of many other characters in the novel, such as Daisy Buchanan, Nick’s cousin and former lover of Jay Gatsby. Like most hopeless romantics, I was in love with the idea of Jay and Daisy and I was ecstatic when he had finally met with her after all of those years of simply reaching out to the green light. However, I was furious with the ending. Gatsby’s demise not only crushed my heart but it angered me as well. Mostly because Tom Buchanan lied on him and got him killed because he was upset that he was losing Daisy. Which is especially annoying since Tom was cheating on Daisy anyway and Gatsby was clearly better and they were genuinely in love, but that’s just my opinion. Another thing I disliked was the number of people, or the lack there of, that showed up to Gatsby’s funeral. It’s weird how he gave so much too so many people and was extremely hospitable but not even his friends or even Daisy herself showed up, only Nick, Gatsby’s father, a few servants and the owl guy were present. I know that although I didn’t like that these things happened that’s what made this story so intriguing. All of the love triangles and the deceit made me want to keep reading and that’s why I would definitely recommend it. It’s also nice when reading a book to be able to identify or relate to some of the characters and I was glad that I was able to do so. I completely understand what it feels like to give more than what you receive out of life, as Gatsby had after being so giving to so many people and having none of them pay their respects in the end. I also really adored Nick’s loyalty towards Gatsby despite his opinion of him at the end. Friendship is a wonderful thing but loyal friends are so much better and I was glad I could also relate to that aspect of the story as well. (436)"
464,Keith,"Everyone is reading The Great Gatsby now!Kobo had announced that sales of this novel has increased by 250% worldwide. Amazon has been selling its Kindle edition for $4.99, and at that price, it has been their best seller for over a hundred days. Though Barnes and Noble has not met that price for their Nook edition, its trade paperback edition is their top seller in that category. My niece had posted on Facebook that the library copies are not only checked out, but also have a waiting list. I had lent a friend my paperback copy, and, in anticipation for the movie release, I had reread The Great Gatsby on my Kindle. Though I have no statistics to support this speculation, I suspect that during the last two months, more people have read that book than at any other two-month period of its history. Though I’m happy for this renewed interest in one of my favorite novels, I regret—perhaps even resent—that it took a major Hollywood release to ignite it. Continue reading..."
465,Mark Peterson,"Arguably considered the greatest american novel ever written, having read through myself I'd say the accolades are well-deserved. At first I was surprised at the novel's brevity, but once I really got into it, I came to see it not as short but as simply distilled down to it pure essence - nothing superfluous, but nothing missing that feels needed either. Coming away, I think one would be hard-pressed to argue that Fitzgerald has acheived anything less than literary perfection, both in the elegant simplicity of his prose and in communicating his themes clearly yet subtly. In terms of sheer technical ability, this is a master novelist at the peak of his craft. The characters of the Great Gatsby feel nuanced and human, even when separated by almost 100 years from the modern world of the reader - I challenge you to find another novel from the 1920s of which you can make that claim. But do the themes that run through it still resonate as well? I'm not so sure the idea of the old money/new money divide holds much relevancy for us now. As for the ""pursuit of the American dream"", I'm not sure the modern dream is the same as that of the earlt 20th century (or maybe it's just because I'm Canaidan). But some of the more general themes (that resist my abilities to clearly articulate) seem likely to be eternal: our irrational tendency to deify our lost loves, how sometimes the dream is better than the reality achieved, and of the tragic but noble manner in which we all pursue our goals, even as they continue to pull away from us. "
466,Abby,My absolute favorite book!
467,Alia,"	I enjoyed the Great Gatsby very much, the plot, the characters, the inner meanings hidden in the story; just about everything. The author’s viewpoint on what American society was like, really shined though in his writing which in all I found very eye opening. 	The story consists of many characters, however, the main ones are very prominent in “The Great Gatsby. First there is Nick Carraway, the man who the story is told though the eyes of and as well as that is the narrator of the story. Next, is Jay Gatsby also known as the “Great Gatsby” in the story and plays the part of the wealthy neighbor and friend of Nick’s. Lastly, there is Daisy Buchanan, the cousin of Nick and the love of Gatsby’s life. 	In this story, Nick Carraway represents a less wealthy, quite and thoughtful character. He is befriended by his neighbor Gatsby and enjoys the benefits of it and Gatsby’s wealth very much, in return he tolerates Gatsby’s near obsession with Daisy. He also arranged the meeting of Gatsby and Daisy, one of the high points in the story and the beginning to the “real story”. Nick, in the beginning is in awe of the riches and luxury of his cousin and his neighbor and seems to want to incorporate himself into that “high life”. He even begins a love affair with Jordan Barker, a professional golfer who lured him with her seemingly carefree lifestyle. Yet in the end he repels from that lifestyle in disgust from the lack of consideration that Jordan and Daisy and Daisy’s husband Tom show others, as well as their dishonesty and shallowness. 	Jay Gatsby formerly James Gatz, had met and fell in love with Daisy years before the time the story is set in. They had promised themselves to one another before Jay had left to go to war, however, Daisy ended up marrying Tom Buchanan knowing that he came from a wealthy background, was well educated and her parents approved of him. When Jay discovered this, he dedicated his whole life to becoming everything he thought Daisy wanted; wealth, sophistication, stability etc., the “American dream”. Jay went so far as to commit major crimes, everything he did was all for Daisy. He acquired millions of dollars, and made a home just across the water from where Daisy lived so he could watch her and be near her. Gatsby even earned himself a reputation in West Egg for extravagant parties that he threw on the weekends, in hopes that Daisy would one day, wander into one of them. Most all of the details of Gatsby’s life weren’t shared until towards the end of the book. I believe the author did this to emphasize that everything in Gatsby’s past all was to work himself up to that current point, in which only Daisy mattered to him and ever since they had met and made love, she was the only thing that really mattered to him. 	 Lastly, there is Daisy Buchanan herself. In the beginning of the story, she is presented as a beautiful young woman who represented the face of what the author believed to be “the American dream”; charm, beauty, sophistication, grace, and wealth. Though as the story progresses, events occur that shows the “bad side” to that face of the “American dream”. Daisy is shown as shallow and careless especially when Myrtle dies at her hand and runs and tries to hide behind her money. She shows her less flattering traits again when she chooses the husband she doesn’t love over Gatsby for her own selfish reasons. As well as this, Daisy rarely mentions her infant in the story almost as though she has little affection and barely cares for her own child. 	Though this story had a tragic ending, in my opinion it seemed very honest and heartfelt all though-out the book. To me, the author conveyed a very strong message in this tale; things are not always what they appear to be. "
468,Betty Ho,Be sure to read the book before you watch the movie. The last thing you want is keep picturing Leonardo's face while reading one of the greatest works in the twentieth century - which ruined my imagination. 
469,Ghaith Lattouf,"Absolutely one of the best, if not the best, novel i have ever read. The characters are all fascinating (especially the charismatic Gatsby), the story is engaging, and the events are absorbing. Gatsby is an extremely rich young man who rose from poverty by participating in organized crime, which was a shock for me personally because initially the author introduced Gatsby as the aloof, likable man who turns to be a quite different lovesick, naive young man who emerges during the latter part of the novel. Through his lies, Gatsby managed to create an illusion about himself and his history, he created a magnificent character for himself, but what's more impressive is that he managed to transform his hopes and dreams into reality, and hence this gives him the quality of ""greatness"". His passions are all for Daisy, his love interest, whom he idealizes, but we later see that wealth causes corruption to the soul which causes his dreams to disintegrate. He suffers the consequences for her actions and dies at the end, and what makes his story more tragic is that no one shows up for his funeral except for a handful of people, even his ""supposedly"" best friend doesn't show up for the sake of his reputation. “When someone is forced to realize that the road he'd been working hard to make progress on was no different from the place he'd started, and when he realized that he had in fact gone backward, all that person can do is face the pale sky and lament.”, this is a quote by Mizuki Nomura which summarizes the whole thing. After working relentlessly throughout his life to be someone worthy of love, he finds out that the very person he idolized betrayed him, and the dreams he had of his future life are all dismantled, which i think is the greatest tragedy in a man's life."
470,Lyndi Dather,"I enjoyed this book a lot mostly because of all of all of the random different people that were involved in other relationships. All of the different plot twists really kept me interested, and the mysteriousness of Gatsby was pretty cool too. The plot of this book is awesome and I love how Fitzgerald shows the time period through his book. The 1920s is shown through the different people and all of the wealth, and I like that the author emphasized those different characteristics in The Great Gatsby."
471,Vemana Madasu,"What a book! What a beautiful and touching (tragic) story. F Scott Fitzgerald wrote a truly brilliant American masterpiece. The language flows magnificently, the characters unravel beautifully and the story unravels admirably. This is a story set in Long Island, NY in prohibition era but has characters and sentiments which are universal. We all must have come across the Bakers and Carroways, Daisys and Toms. But among them was Gatsby who is like no other. Like Nick says early in the book, He has a smile which you see 4 maybe 5 times in your life. This is a character which keeps you struggling old sport, cos you know it's sorry plight but revel in it's glory. No wonder he is the Great GatsbyThe movie is to be out soon. A great director and great cast has me excited. But the main reason I took up this book again for the second time in as many years was the fantastic narration by Frank Muller. His role as the narrator, for me, is as important as Fitzgerald's. "
472,Carol Smith,"I first read Gatsby some 25-30 years ago (wait - did I just write that?!?!). I loved it at the time but thought I'd forgotten much of it in the intervening years. Thought it would be worth a second visit given Baz Luhrmann's upcoming Christmas extravaganza (in 3D no less!). It's amazing how much of a great novel can stay with you over the years. As I read the opening pages - the languid descriptions of Daisy and Jordan lolling on a divan - it all rushed back to me. The story was still there, within me, deeply embedded. It only took a few paragraphs for it all to come bursting back to the surface. A hallmark of a great work? I think so.Great writing is such a treat. This is luscious stuff. Example (one of many):The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car (p. 90). Pure music."
473,Amber,So that's like my billionth reread. Nothing less than a masterpiece.
474,Madison,"I just finished the book The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. I read the book a couple of years ago and now I listened to the audio version of it, although I still have not seen the movie. I did not enjoy listening to the audio version of the book because I found it very distracting. A lot of people say that you can multitask while listening to an audio book but I found myself easily distracted., as soon as I began listening to the book I always remembered to do something that I forgot to do. I find it a lot more enjoyable to read a book because I tend to get lost in a book and can really focus on what I am reading. I glad that I read the book before listening to the audio version because I really liked to book and I think that if I had listened to the audio first I would not have liked it as much. I would have had a different outlook on the book. I really like the book The Great Gatsby, but I do not enjoy listening to books, I would rather read them myself. I give the book 5 stars but the audio 2 stars. "
475,Lauren  Librarian,"Upon rereading The Great Gatsby, I realized that I had not actually read this book the first time. Like many of those who were educated in the United States, I was assigned The Great Gatsby in high school, but I probably didn't finish it. Once I gave it the proper attention, I found this book to be elegantly written with concise, gorgeous prose that was o-so-quotable.""She's got an indiscreet voice,"" I remarked. ""It's full of ----"" I hesitated. ""Her voice is full of money,"" he said suddenly. That was it. I'd never understood it before. I was full of money -- that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals' song of it...It's a tragedy, and I think it's not such a bad thing to know this going into the novel. If you read it like a tragedy instead of a love story, it's quite good and poignant for what it is. One thing that makes this book such a classic is the obvious work put into it. The editing was ruthless, leaving only the barest and most necessary details to the story. Fitzgerald polished the language until it gleamed, giving us phrases that mean more than one thing while also being clever and witty on their own.Described most succinctly as a ""scene novel,"" the characters flaunt the trendiness of the parties they get invited to, wearing the cutting edge of Prohibition Era fashion, and employ their wittiest, wryest remarks as long as everyone is listening. Having been written in 1925, The Great Gatsby is a genuine Prohibition Era novel, written around the time that the characters are living. Because of this, a few phrases were outdated or difficult for me to understand at first without understanding their context. The author describes one girl as having ""a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milk white,"" which sounds a bit confusing in a modern context. I assume that ""sticky"" meant straight-as-a-stick, solid meant thick and full of body, and a milk white complexion is probably not as bad as I'm thinking. At one point one girl compliments Mrs. Wilson's dress who responds by ""raising her eyebrow in disdain. 'It's just a crazy old thing,' she said. 'I just slip it on sometimes when I don't care what I look like.' I'm sure this was just the coolest thing to say when someone complimented you in the 1920s, but I actually laughed out loud while reading it.One disappointment with The Great Gatsby for me was the ending. I felt that so much was left unexplained and Daisy's perspective was conspicuously absent from the conclusion."
476,Mikaylynn Williams,One of the Classics :)
477,JakeA,I thought this was a really good book and I would not mind reading it over and over again. It shows the story of a man named Nick living in New York during the roaring twenties. The story is as much about his life as is about the mysterious Jay Gatsby who lives in the vast mansion next store. It had a very interesting story as Nick discovers more about Gatsby and what ends up playing out after he reunites his cousin Daisy with her lost love Gatsby. It showed a very interesting view into the life of a man in the twenties as he becomes involved with rich New Yorkers and gets involved in their multiple love triangles.
478,Hadleigh Callahan," (SPOILERS..kinda) This book mad me cry, a lot. *cough endlessly cough* I found this book to be very thought provoking. Gatsby wanted to go back to the past, a past that no longer exsisted. I think there is a certain innocence in Gatsby that Daisy no longer had after marrying the perfidious Tom Buchanan. Daisy gave up on love, she chose her high class social life over Jay. That makes me really sad! Jay Gatsby was like a puppy whose owner (aka Daisy) had bought a new, bigger dog, who is more impressive in public places. AT the same time, however, I can totally see where Daisy was coming from, not wanting to just drop everything and leave with Gatsby. For years, Gatsby was dead to her, she thought he had died in the war. So she soldiered on, married into a good family, and she had a baby girl. That isn't a life you can just abandon. Though it's true that Tom cheated shamelessly on Daisy, but I think there still was some love there for her, or at least, there was at some point. This book just ends soo tragically too! I think I'm with Nick Carraway on the whole situation. The idea of the whole of high society is appalling to me, yet immensely intriguing to me. Like the sad people of the internet say; ""Ain't no party like a Gatsby party because a Gatsby party don't stop... until at least two people are dead, and everyone is disillusioned with the Jazz Age as a whole."" "
479,Magoo,"I love this novel. Love it. Even before Leo! The exploration of such flawed but truly believable characters engages me every time I read it. There is something of all of us in every character. You desperately want Gatsby to succeed whilst knowing all along, ultimately his essentially adulterous behaviour, cannot possibly succeed, or should it? Should the dream survive? Does it deserve to? Jordan baker's flawed and insecure character I think is even more relevant today than ever before. This was the character that captured me the most on this reading. Every woman? Every teen? Every desperate celebrity? The veneer v the reality? Desperately trying to hold it together. She feels like every cover of New Idea. . ""This clean hard limited person"". Insecure liar. I love the quote from Nick that states ""there is only the pursued the pursuing the busy and the tired"". Contemporary life? Yup. Constantly pretending. The sweetness of Tom Buchanan realizing his mistress is leaving town. The desperation as both men realise the dream is lost with Daisy's admissions of 'love'. Gatsby's heartbreaking understanding that she isn't going to call. And of course Dr TJ Eckleberg. Dead. God is dead."
480,Nika,"They say youth is wasted on the young, but I'm beginning to think good books are wasted on the young. At least they were on me. For the twenty years since high school English class, I have walked around thinking I had ""read"" this novel. No, I now realize, I did not read it until yesterday. And I am amazed. "
481,Kristy,"This was one of the few required high school reading assignments that I actually enjoyed. There's something about forced reading that automatically takes the joy out of a book! I've read ""Gatsby"" a few times since then and each time I get something new out of it. There's a reason it's considered a classic--it embodies the American dream and it's still relevant today. I tried watching the most recent movie a few months ago and couldn't get into it at all. I think Baz Lurman (I really admire him as a director!) spent too much time on the glitz and glamor and really missed the mark as far as the storyline went. But that's just my opinion. It's nice to revisit an old favorite every once in awhile, and everyone should fit a few classics in between the chick lit and YA dystopian novels!"
482,Nigie,"A melancholy melody shimmers in the sunset gleamings of this gorgeous ruby of a book. That's the kind of poetry it's full of, all 180 all-too-brief pages of it. A romance upon the innocence of faith, its high intelligence seeps into you subtly like opium. I've reread it now to distill its unruffled perfection in my mind before the expected histrionic assault of the impending Baz Luhrmann film adaptation, which as a filmmaker myself I cannot avoid but see.Narrated in the serene, regretful voice of midwesterner Nick Carraway, it tells of the summer of his 1922 in New York City, where he works as a bonds salesman, commuting to Manhattan from mansion-studded Long Island where he rents a modest wooden cottage between marble wedding cakes. It's the story of the brief friendship with his enigmatic neighbour, a young millionaire named Jay Gatsby, who it turns out holds a flame for Nick's cousin Daisy, residing for the moment with her husband, 'the polo player' Tom Buchanan, on the more exclusive side of the bay. A tiny green light at the end of the Buchanans' private jetty twinkles across the water to Gatsby's waterfront lawns by night, and is introduced as the first inkling of his five-year fixation on winning Daisy back. Unfolded from various mouths, the Gatsby/Daisy backstory is sporadically interleaved with his present-day quest to reclaim her in a procession of opulent and riotous parties mounted to dazzle back her lost adoration. It's about how low-born Gatsby sees the only road to her high-born heart lying in the acquisition of enough wealth to float her away forever on a serene cloud of abandon. It's about a common boy's invention of a fantastical identity by which to seduce another, with which to restore the past, and through which to attain the unattainable. It's about how the unavoidable inflation of a dream over time through daily obsession, and with an ever-growing list of almost hormonally romanticised associations (like the green light on that distant dock) can only result in anticlimax. And, without condemnation, it's about the cost in blood, ash and garbage of igniting and nurturing such a flame, however innocent and noble may be the cause.The story is told as an eye-witness account of some remarkable sights from a Golden Age, with the surreal poeticism of a dreamer, and my instinct is that Fitzgerald owes much of his exquisite prose's tonal success to Lewis Carroll: in this Mad Hatter's tea party of a book there is many a Dormouse and a March Hare, with as much non-sequiturial enchantment as was to be had in Wonderland. And his depictions of vulgarity are so vividly arch that you feel as delighted as a child by an uncle doing an astute impersonation of your grandmother. But this story, as adoringly as he tells it, is nevertheless a classicist's meditation on the real world, but a real world that's moving so fast and with such powerful collective intent that even those in the stampede haven't a clue where they're heading, blinded by the exhilaration of the instinct to conquer. It's only Nick's wise eyes (and those depicted in a roadside billboard advertising the services of Queensborough oculist Dr T. J. Eckleberg) that seem awake enough at least partially to dissect it all for us. And as his simple story turns like a jewel between your fingertips, the ideas in its heart begin to sparkle, and a tragic profundity, belied by its initially superficial beauty, becomes apparent. This writer is a genius.Tempting as it is to write an essay, I must remind myself that this should be a review, designed to recommend (or otherwise) the book in question. Nevertheless, themes that occupied this writer in the early 1920s remain compelling today. When I first visited the US, something heady in its social atmosphere reminded me of the mayhem into which my Grade 1 class would descend soon after the teacher left the room, and Fitzgerald talks of Gatsby's party guests as having ""conducted themselves with the rules of behaviour associated with an amusement park"". The Great Gatsby is a portrait of American society -- first founded in the name of equal opportunity by pioneers who fled injustice and despotism in Europe, and later fattened by millions who came to follow the flame -- at the absolute peak of its incandescence, when the nation's wealth had resulted in glories that exceeded those of its Euro forbears, and while the resources of its soil seemed still unchallengeably infinite. Accordingly it's an allegory on faith, and how those unwoken from the American dream have taken the pursuit of happiness to mean the pursuit of money, mistaken wealth for freedom, and it chronicles in poetry the spiritual symptoms of such carelessness, ranging from the p-p-paralysis of simple ennui to mortal grief and murder-suicide. It's about humanity's innate instinct for belief, the inborn power of our imagination, our unextinguishable fascination with illusion, and how the fulfilment of a fantasy, whatever acts of genius were required in doing so, must puncture it forever. Maybe, in the tritest terms, you could say it's about how the journey is more fulfilling than the destination. But it's more than that: it warns how a misplacement of rapture - a concoction of love - may become gullibility, with all the consequent appeal such gullibility holds for scavengers and corruption: avarice hypnotises.Is greed a form of love? Does the author sanction greed and its consequences because he believes that at its heart our delight in what glitters is intrinsically innocent, and that this compulsion, coupled with dedication, skill and ingenuity, may create wonders? Americans landed on the moon. They created Rhapsody in Blue. They built Disneyland and invented the Mac. But they also well-nigh wiped out the continent's first peoples, and have raped and pillaged many other cultures since, examples, perhaps, of the ashes of the flame. Fitzgerald mentions nothing of America's indigenous in his masterpiece, nor does he much enquire into the nature of power. But he does question the sanity of obsessive individualism, and does rue the cost of the magic of free enterprise. And he wrote at a time when, like an organ's bellows, the exhilarating contagion of the American dream still seemed all-powerful, infinite enough for its roar to drown out such issues from the attentive ears of a moral young dreamer with a pen. He was inspired into a reverie on possession: of being possessed and of needing to possess, charting the spiritual symptoms common to both romantic love and materialism. There has been an endless parade of gods in human history, and perhaps the true deity of our recent millennia has been money (its ephemeral divinity represented, for this book, in Daisy's voice). If so, for curious future generations The Great Gatsby will stand high in the pantheon of visionary chronicles of our time.This is one of the world's great works. If you haven't already found it, read it now. Before you see the damn movie. "
483,Ranya,"In the short novel, The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the narrator Nick Carraway explains the relevance of wealth through different lifestyles. The narrator speaks of his many travels and the reader finds that he is living in the West Egg section in New York, a neighborhood populated primarily by those who are new to being wealthy. Living next door in his neighborhood, Jay Gatsby, is a wealthy man that hosts a multitude of profuse parties. Nick's relative, Daisy, and her husband, Tom live on the other side of town in the East Egg section. The reader soon comes to find out that Daisy had known Jay Gatsby five years earlier from when they were both in the military. However, Daisy disliked Jay due to his lack of prosperity. In contrast, Daisy loved the fact that Tom was much wealthier and lived a more extravagant lifestyle. It turns out that Jay had in fact been involving himself in illegal business dealings in order to impress Daisy in the long run, believing that she would soon leave Tom for him. Drama arises when Tom's jealousy begins to kick in as well as the fact that Daisy is impressed that Jay had stayed true to her with contrast to Tom's acquirement of a mistress. Due to the fact that Daisy had escaped with Jay's car and hit her husband's mistress, the final result was Tom's murdering of Jay Gatsby and an empty funeral with nothing but thoughts that fill the gaps of missing people. 	Although Jay Gatsby cannot be regarded as an idol for all human existence, he can represent the way that love can be misinterpreted. He fell in love with Daisy, but the feeling was not mutual. Rather than trying to win her over with the cliché idea of having a good personality and having common hobbies, he chooses to become wealthy through whatever it takes just to make her love him more. He involves himself in crimes and even drug dealing just to reach that point, but ironically in the end, he was not killed for all the crimes he had committed, but rather a crime he did not do…killing Tom's mistress. The author tries to make this look like Jay had gotten the punishment that he deserves, even if it was not directly for something he actually did. 	The interesting thing about this book that makes it stand out among many others within the same genre is that it portrays the American dream in a way like none other. The story from the outside looks like a simple love story and how it is confronted with materialism. However, what the story really portrays is the American dream. Daisy is a human form of the American dream. Everyone wants to keep her, but they all believe that the best way to reach her is by becoming extremely wealthy, which in the same sense is the American dream. The idea of being in America to gain wealth is truly, what the American dream signifies for many people.	I recommend this book for all that look for analyzing a book for more than it simply is on the outside and more of what each character and event symbolizes. I went in with high expectations and came out satisfied by the tangible ending that the author gave to the reader and the way the author and the narrator were separated and not made into one character or personality."
484,Marieke Mills,An absolutely wonderful novel that is worthy of being named a classic. For the complete review go to: http://mariekemills.com/2015/10/28/re...
485,Aaron,"	Full spoilers ahead. The Great Gatsby is another of the famous high school novels that I never had the pleasure of enjoying in my school, but now that I have read it, I can say it lives up to its praise. This is primarily the story of the excessively rich and mysterious Jay Gatsby that lives next door to the fairly quiet narrator Nick Carraway. Throughout the narrative, you learn that Gatsby was originally a handsome young man from a poor western family with the last name Gatz, but he soon came into his fame and fortune through the help of Meyer Wolfsheim and Dan Cody. Gatsby fell madly in love with Nick’s cousin Daisy during his time in the military, but was somehow shipped to Oxford after he was discharged, leaving Daisy in need of security that she finds through Tom Buchannan. After five months at Oxford, Gatsby makes his money and buys his mansion across the within sight of Tom and Daisy’s home where he gazes at the green dock light dreaming of the future that may have Daisy in it. Gatsby then uses Nick to rekindle his relationship with Daisy while Tom pursues an affair with Myrtle Wilson. The tension finally culminates on a scorching hot day in town after Tom and Gatsby switch cars for the drive, and the Wilson’s see Tom in Gatsby’s car with Nick’s love interest, Jordan. Later that night, Daisy accidently hits and kills Myrtle in Gatsby’s vehicle, and Gatsby takes the blame from the group, but hides himself in his home to avoid the police. The next day, Tom and Daisy leave town for a while, and Gatsby is shot while lounging in his pool by Myrtle’s husband who you later learn got the information on the car from Tom earlier that day. Nick goes into the process of setting up Gatsby’s funeral, but no one seems interested enough to make an appearance except Gatsby’s father and the owl eyed man from one of Gatsby’s earlier parties. After a small funeral, Nick decides to close some relationships in New York, and move west in hopes of regaining some of his childhood memories. The novel finishes with Nick laying on the beach contemplating the green light of Daisy’s dock and the hopes that it held for the ill-fated Gatsby.	I first want to say that I really enjoyed this novel. I found the tone and diction easy to follow, and I was pushing through each chapter with ease. Before I knew it, I was finishing up Nick’s final moments of contemplation on the famous green light. The narrative is constantly giving off a sense of deeper meaning that is begging for interpretation, and the final message that I took away is well beyond the face narrative of the novel. I found a message of desire, determination, a brighter, but unattainable future, and constant circulation to the past. In one way it was a depressing conclusion, but I felt like I could relate to the way of life that Nick suggests through the green light. Constantly working for a brighter future that forces you to reflect on your past, only to find yourself working even more for a future you may never see realized.	Three critical questions: Why did Gatsby and Nick not want to tell anyone that Daisy was driving the night Myrtle was killed? What effect does it have on the narrative not knowing the exact means of Gatsby’s fortune? What are the possible implications of the green light on Daisy’s dock for Gatsby and Nick?"
486,Jjbarbs,"The Great Gatsby is an astounding book that deserves to be hailed as one of the best of all time. On the surface it seem to be nothing more than a slightly twisted love story, but it is so much more. The novel describes the corruption of the American dream and how money can change people. The story is told through Nick Carraway, a World War I veteran who became newly rich due to the rise in the stock market. He moves into a wealthy neighborhood in the West Egg district of Long Island. The neighborhood is filled with other newly rich residents, including the title character Jay Gatsby, who throws massive parties for the neighborhood every Saturday. Of course, everything starts to take a turn for the worst eventually, but it is done in such a manner as to reflect the thought of wealth at the time.The Great Gatsby portrays the new American dream as just a hunt for wealth, not for discovery and the pursuit of happiness as it used to be. This wealth changes people and makes them hollow. The Great Gatsby does a great job of showing the reader the dangers of wealth and how times have changed, while also being a very entertaining read. The deeper the reader looks into the book and the longer the time he takes to analyze it, the better it gets. The only flaw The Great Gatsby really has is that the overarching story found on the surface is very predictable, but after that the book goes very deep into human greed and its effects. The Great Gatsby is definitely worth reading, no matter what your interests are. It has so many layers that almost everyone could easily find a niche that bests fits them. "
487,Zöe Yu,"Great novel. I can never forget the green light from far away. Very emotional, very beautiful story. I wonder who can tell moeny from love in that story."
488,Tyler Ochs,"The Great Gatsby was without a doubt my favorite book I read in high school. Early on in the book, I found myself a little bit bored, but as the colors and descriptive imagery increased, I found myself more and more interested in the book. From the use of the green and green light, and the blue eyes of T.J. Eckleburg, the author does a fantastic job painting the image of the story.I think as stated above, the strength is the description. The imagery is fantastic and you can envision the entire story. The weakness I see is that it is outdated, and so as time goes on, younger readers may not be able to relate to the book. The movie does a great job of keeping young kids interested, and hopefully this decline does not occur. I do think the book can be confusing too, especially as halfway through the book the author just decides to throw in the history of Gatsby out of no where. I think the most interesting part of the book was the development of Gatsby by the utilization of other characters. We find out about Gatsby not so much based on Gatsby, but how other people react and feel about him. For example up until Nick meets Gatsby, all we hear is rumors. ""He killed a man,"" ""He was a war hero,"" ""He was a direct ancestor of the Kaiser,"" etc. Once Nick meets Gatsby, we find out about Gatsby through how Nick describes him. We see this later too with how Daisy and Tom both describe Gatsby.Lastly, I think a huge strength is its historical context. Everything from prohibition in the 1920's to the fixing of the 1919 World Series, F. Scott Fitzgerald does a fantastic job conveying what it was like to be in that time period of the United States. I highly recommend this book to all, before seeing the movie, because the book does such an incredible job of imagery that as you are reading you feel you are attending one of Gatsby's parties."
489,David Kellogg,"OK, everybody read this book in high school, and I did too. I re-read it just now, almost thirty years later, when my son was assigned it for school. I recall not liking it very much the first time, but I could not remember why. Possibly I just resented the notion of books presented as ""classics"" and therefore enforced reading. Possibly I disliked the emphasis of the teacher, which if I recall was on symbolism: those billboard eyes, those blinking lights. Possibly I was just too young, as I imagine most people are who are assigned the book. The things that strike me now as such achievements -- tension built in dialogue, the multiple weaving narratives, all the social critique, Gatsby's life of fantasy, Nick's complex relationship to that life, the recognized and unrecognized sexual attractions, basically every human dimension -- slipped by me in the hostility of a required reading. "
490,Summer Shuler,just re-read this book after 12 years or so. Fitzgerald is genius. 
491,Caroline Anna Bock,"How does one review a classic? I recently re-read and wrote a haiku response to the book that was totally unexpected for me!!THE POOL CLEANERI cleaned the swim pool— after cops fished Gatsby out—more work, no more pay.If you haven't read BEFORE MY EYES, my new mature YA novel, (ALSO SET ON LONG ISLAND where the Great Gatsby is set), I hope you will consider it.Before My EyesBest,Caroline "
492,Heather Goodman,"I hadn't read this book since high school. I remembered something about its Americanness, that I loved it, and that Robert Redford played Gatsby in the movie we watched in English class following our reading.Re-reading this book awed me. It's nothing short of brilliant: tightly written, vivid descriptions, and, yes, it embodies something about America, who we are in our optimism and failings and disappointments even today. My pen was busy. Every sentence captures some essential meaning, yet not in an elusive, elitist way but in a way that propels you forward until you come to the final page and you've finished the book and it's changed you. Fitzgerald knits into the story the themes and imagery like a fair isle sweater that displays its beauty and color while hiding the intricate work underneath. In fact, you might say that the mystery of the novel's beauty and meaning mirrors the mystery of Gatsby himself. I could go on about his use of light and eyes and deception and self-deception and distance and time and character, but perhaps that's for another space. On the one hand, it's a book for the young by the young about the young. On the other hand, it's a book whose complexity and richness you grow to appreciate as you get older. I can't wait to see how I'll read it in another 20 years."
493,Soesja Schelling,"This might have become one of my favourite books ever. I don't know why I don't read more classics, because I read two last year and I gave them both five stars. Oh well.With this book, I kinda ignored my 'read the book before you go see the movie' rule. And I loved the movie. I saw it twice in theater. I figured that there had to be some great material being the key to such a great movie, so I ordered the book. At first, I was really surprised about how little pages there were. But it kept the story going and it was never boring. And that story - oh how I love it. And oh, how I hate it at the same time. I love how awkward but cute Gatsby is from deep within, and how rich and mysterious he is from the outside. I love how it is told by Nick. I love the descriptions of the parties. I hated how mean Tom and Daisy were, but I loved the way this was worked into the story. I hated the ending, but it does fit the story really beautifully. What's more to say. I finished this book yesterday and I already feel like reading it again. I love the complex language (maybe it's not THAT complex, but English is my second language, so well) and all the sentences feeling like little poems to me. Overall, I just really enjoyed this book, and I would read it again without hesitation. "
494,Devon Deckard,"4.5 out of 5 ***** Where to even begin... This was a completely mesmerizing story. I mean, totally consuming. I did the audiobook (yea I know, that's the only way I'm getting through books here lately). I just was wrapped up and sucked unto a whole different book while listening. I would soak in the tub while listening, and the only thing that would snap me back is a husband knocking on the door to check on me because it would be like 30-45 minutes would have passed. The descriptions in this book are completely out of this world. He just paints this vivid beautiful picture that is so incredibly life like. Just the vocabulary for his description words alone are.. just wow. Some thing isn't just ""a black shirt"" it would be something along the lines of ""a shirt so black that it looked like black hole in outer space that would suck you in into its dark abyss and never let you go. A shirt so dark and soft that it would consume you soul and make you completely forget what sunlight is or how it felt on your skin in the late afternoon in summer "". Something like that but much, much better haha. This is actually on a personal book challange of mine. 50 books, 5 over 500 pages, 1 autobiography, and 1 CLASSIC BOOK (check!!). I didn't know much about the book beforehand. I'm not one to read the summarys, I guess I'm just a sucker for suprises. But the story is written from a man name Nick Caraway's point of view. I actually forgot what his career is. But he moves into a rental house next to a massive mansion. The mansion belongs to the famouse Jay Gatsby. They met at one of Gatsby's famous parties, and after chitchatting for a while they become close friends. As the story unfolds you find out Gatsby is madly in love with Nick's cousin. That's all I can really say without giving too much away. Just know the ending is sad. Like I was choking up on the last 10 minutes (I'm going to blame pregnancy hormones on that one). It's just a very touching ending and something I didn't see coming at all till the last probably 3 chapters. I loved it. I'm wondering why I'm just now reading this book. Like seriously?? Why didn't we read this in highschool?! It was sooo good. I will definitely watch the movie now and see how they portray everything. It was just such a fantastic book.D.deckard"
495,Luis Salas,"The Great Gatsby is a great book it showed the readers like us the way people lived in the 1920's. the book was based on a man who went from zero to the most popular man on long island. and it really spoke out to me because my family went threw the same thing as well. And it with all the magnificent colors that constantly play a big role in the book, it shows one of the wonderful sides of the 1920's. It also showed the terrible way in which woman were still being dominated by men just like Daisy and Myrtle and how they are control by Tom. But it was a great book and i would recommend it to others."
496,Sylwia,"Every once in a while I'll come across a book that, while reading it, implies to me that it has been holding all of the secrets to my life inside of it, if not many secrets about the world itself. Maybe that's ridiculous and maybe much like the author struggled with alcohol, I became intoxicated by his words, certain that through reading them I'd come up with some of the wisest epiphanies about myself. To say that I enjoyed this book is an understatement. It did something to me. It woke me up and cradled me to sleep and brought out latent ideas inside of me that we're only waiting for their seals to be broken. I recommend this book to everyone because of its descriptions, its quirks, and the thoughts and feelings that I assume it evokes in everyone. This is the kind of book that teaches you something, but I suppose that you have to be open to learning in order for it to succeed."
497,Hans,"This story haunts me and has since I was a teenager. The reckless tragedy is a perfect metaphor for the American Delusion. Our struggle for endless material wealth just to overcome our insecurities and inability to accept ourselves. Meanwhile like Tom and Daisy, we ""smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money of their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made."". And yet each generation of Americans has to re-learn this tragic lesson.The frustrating part is how Gatsby is both to be admired and pitied. He appears to be the quintessential self-made man on the outside but behind him stands a life he would rather no one ever discover. His fortune built upon deception. Gatsby and Daisy's love isn't even real. It is rather an obsession with a symbol. Daisy, the Golden Girl, is Gatsby's symbolic validation of being a real man while Gatsby is the symbol of freedom and escape that Daisy so desperately craves under the tyranny of Tom. I imagine that even if Gatsby lived their relationship wouldn't survive but instead be a huge disappointment when they both got what they wanted and the fantasy would come crashing down. All in all, F. Scott Fitzgerald is to be applauded for being a master of English prose, though the story is short his words pack a beautiful punch. Here are my favorite quotes:""There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams--not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion.""""Americans, while occasionally willing to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry.""""With every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.""""He must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about...like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees.""""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning-- So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
498,Georgina,"It's taken me a long time to read this book....I regret not reading it sooner.Beautifully written and incredibly honest, it tells the story of how the dream of the future can often get muddled with the reality of the past. A great book that takes you on a journey, if you're into your classic literature I suggest you give this a go."
499,Pamela Scott,"I loved The Great Gatsby. I found it incredibly sad. I loved the way Fitzgerald writes and brings the period and characters to life. This is a very short novel, just over the length of a novella but I feel like I read something several hundred pages longer. I liked Nick’s voice and thought he was an interesting character. The viewpoint used was quite interesting. Everything is told through Nick’s eyes, an outsider, a 3rd party who witnesses the love triangle between Daisy, Tom and Gatsby. I wonder what The Great Gatsby would have been like if the viewpoint was someone else? I can’t decide if I like Gatsby or not. I felt sorry for him. I personally think Daisy was a horrible person and god knows why he was so obsessed with her. But at the time, Gatsby is essentially obsessed with her to the extent he stalks her and forces himself back into her life. I found him a little creepy. However, I really didn’t like Daisy. She comes across as a horrible person who didn’t marry Gatsby because he was poor and went running into Tom’s arms as well, because he was rich. I really disliked Tom. The ending shocked me and made me feel really sad. I had a great time reading The Great Gatsby."

501,Pardis Parto,فیتس جرالد، «گتسبی بزرگ» را در سال 1925، یعنی هشتاد سال پیش و در بیست‌ونه سالگی‌اش منتشر کرده است؛ (دقت کنید که چنین شاهکاری زمانی منتشر شده است که «جمال‌زاده»ی ما ایرانی‌ها سرگرم «یکی بود، یکی نبود» و «قصه‌ی ما به سر رسید» بوده و پدر داستان‌نویسی مدرن‌مان صادق هدایت، هنوز با «سرگذشت یک الاغ در حال مرگ» و «فواید گیاهخواری» دست و پنجه نرم می‌کرده است!)موضوع داستان «گتسبی بزرگ» به غایت تکراری و کلیشه‌ای است: عشق؛ موضوعی که از ابتدای حیات انسان، دستمایه‌ی آفرینش‌های مختلف هنری از جمله شعر، موسیقی، داستان، نمایش، فیلم و... بوده و از این پس هم تا پایان حیات انسان خواهد بود. تنها، نویسنده‌ای استوارقلم، هم‌چون فیتس جرالد می‌تواند داستانی را که موضوع آن عشق و از آن کلیشه‌ای‌تر عشق یک پسر فقیر به دختری ثروتمند است، از دام ابتذال برهاند و به قله‌ی رفیع هنر برساند.شاه‌زاده‌ی داستان «گتسبی بزرگ» دختری زیباروی به نام «دی‌زی» است و «گدا»ی آن هم «گتسبی»؛ «جی گتسبی» مرد جوانی است که حدودن سی‌سال پیش، با نام واقعی «جیمز گتس» در شهری دورافتاده و در خانواده‌ای فقیر به دنیا آمده است. پدر و مادرش «کشاورزان تهیدستی بودند که طعم کامیابی را هرگز نچشیده‌ بودند»، اما «جیمز» سودای جایگاهی بسیار رفیع‌تر از موقعیت فعلی‌اش را در سر می‌پروراند و شب و روزش به پر و بال‌دادن بیش‌تر و گسترده‌تر رویاهایش می‌گذرد.هفده ساله است که شانس به او رو می‌کند و فرصتی فراهم می‌شود که بتواند سوار کشتی یک تاجر میلیونر به نام «دان کودی» شود و کم‌کم با نزدیک‌شدن بیش‌تر به او، راه و روش پیمودن مدارج ترقی را بیاموزد.در همین هنگام است که جیمز گتس که حالا نام پرطمطراق‌تر «جی گتسبی» را برای خود انتخاب کرده، گرفتار هنگامه‌ی عشق دی‌زی می‌شود. دی‌زی دختری بسیار جذاب و از خانواده‌ای ثروتمند است که خواستاران فراوانی دارد؛ گتسبی به هر طریقی که شده خود را به دی‌زی نزدیک می‌کند و بین این‌دو علاقه‌ی متقابلی شکل می‌گیرد اما دی‌زی دوست دارد که «بی‌درنگ زندگی‌اش شکل بگیرد» و این تصمیم بیش از هر چیز نیازمند «پول یا امکانات عملی»ست؛ گتسبی هیچ‌کدام آن‌ها ‌را ندارد، اما مردی به نام «تام بیوکنن» سر می‌رسد که هر دو را با هم دارد و دی‌زی «از این‌که چنین آدمی به خواستگاریش آمده به خود می‌بالد».راوی داستان مرد جوانی است به نام «نیک کاره‌وی» که از «غرب میانه» در تلاش معاش به شرق آمده است و در جزیره‌واره‌ای به نام «وست اگ» که چسبیده به همزادش «ایست اگ» است ساکن شده است. در جوار منزل محقر او، قصر باشکوهی‌ست که پیوسته در آن مهمانی‌های مجلل برگزار می‌شود و ولخرجی‌های صاحب‌اش پای چه بسیار کسان را که به آن‌جا باز نکرده است. درست روبه‌روی این قصر و آن‌طرف تنگه در ایست اگ، دی‌زی و تام در خانه‌ای مجلل اما نه به‌سان قصر مجاور او و صد البته بسیار بی‌سروصداتر از آن، زندگی می‌کنند. چندان مایه‌ی تعجب نخواهد بود که دریابیم قصر مجللی که شکوه و جلال و مهمانی‌های آن‌چنانی آن زبان‌زد مردم شده است، متعلق به «گتسبی»ست که پس از ناکامی‌اش در رسیدن به «دی‌زی» به شیوه‌ای نامعلوم ثروتی هنگفت به‌دست آورده و حالا این خانه را خریده که نزدیک‌ترین موقعیت را نسبت به خانه‌ی دی‌زی داشته باشد. تام، هم‌سر دی‌زی، مردی‌ست که معشوقه‌ای به نام مرتل ویلسن دارد و این باعث دلخوری دی‌زی است. وقتی سر و کله‌ی گتسبی پیدا می‌شود و او در پی برقرای رابطه‌ی گذشته‌اش با دی‌زی برمی‌آید، مرتل ویلسن و ماجرای عشقی او با تام، می‌تواند بهترین کاتالیزور برای جدایی دی‌زی از تام و ازدواجش با گتسبی ِ حالا دیگر «بزرگ» باشد، اما این اتفاق نمی‌افتد.هرچند رابطه‌ی دی‌زی و گتسبی روزبه‌روز گرم‌تر و رابطه‌ی دی‌زی با تام روزبه‌روز سردتر می‌شود، اما پایان خوشی که شاید خواننده انتظار آن‌را می‌کشد رخ نمی‌دهد؛ در یک عصرگاه، دی‌زی که به هم‌راه گتسبی در حال برگشت از نیویورک به وست اگ است، با اتومبیل مجلل گتسبی «مرتل» را که به هم‌راه شوهرش آقای «ویلسن» در یک گاراژ بین راهی ساکن است، زیر می‌گیرد و می‌کشد و بعد هم بدون توقف، صحنه را ترک می‌کند؛ ویلسن، به گمان این‌که گتسبی پشت فرمان بوده، به منزل او می‌رود و او را با شلیک چند گلوله از پا در می‌آورد و سپس خود را می‌کشد. دی‌زی و تام، به سفر رفته‌اند و حتا بدون این‌که دی‌زی از مرگ گتسبی خبردار شود، امپراطوری او به همین سادگی فرو می‌پاشد و همه‌چیز پایان می‌پذیرد.فیتس جرالد، با انتخاب راوی بی‌طرف ناظر که نقش چندان مهمی در رمان ندارد، موفق شده است به زیبایی زندگی پرماجرای گتسبی و داستان عشق بی‌فرجام او به دی‌زی را روایت کند. «کنت دایان»، منتقد انگلیسی گفته است که «گتسبی بزرگ، کتابی است که از تارک شاه‌موج امریکایی به ساحل افکنده شده و برای همه‌ی ما جاذبه‌ای آنی و ماندنی دارد» و «تی. اس. الیوت» نیز در نامه‌ای به فیتس جرالد نوشته است: «گتسبی بزرگ، نخستین گامی است که داستان‌نویسی آمریکایی بعد از هنری جیمز برداشته است».

503,January,"This book once again blew me away. I have to confess, I had trouble starting it this time. I was reading it in the middle of a chaotic time, and I just couldn't get into all the unnecessary decadence, the emptiness, the waste. BUT, ah the brilliance of Fitzgerald. Once school ended and I could see - all this decadence was the facade for Gatsby, the not- so- subtle metaphor for his life. Once I transitioned into the actual appearance of Gatsby and his deep ardent, heartbreaking desires, the story became even more beautiful and beautifully tragic.... it just creeps up on you. The characters were also wonderful to come back to -I still loathed Tom with a passion of course, and I still disliked Daisy (I couldn't remember why at first but it all came back to me - she was weak, and didn't deserve him) Nick grew on me slowly, but the one who intrigued the most this tine was Jordan, and I couldn't precisely say why. She seemed to be the most realistic, and then had the most to lose maybe? The others were lost from the start.... well I cannot go into all here although it seems like Im going to do so! Suffice it to say, I was thrilled two years ago to hear Baz Lurhman was going to make a movie adaptation; I have been eagerly waiting to re-read and see the movie ever since - part one is done :)"
504,Ravyn,"I have read a lot of books in my time. A whole doctors library full of novels and short stories and poems and anything you can imagine. Very good books too, ive cried and ive laughed and its been hard to put down all these books. But nothing can compare to Gatsby. This book is the best book I have ever read and I am quite sure ill never pick up another book that can compare to the true masterpiece that was The Great Gatsby. It was almost impossible to put this book down and the entire time I read my mouth was just hanging wide open. I wish I could shake Fitzgeralds hand and thank him for creating what is quite possibly the greatest piece of work the world has ever seen, in my opinion.10/10 would recommend "
505,Diane Reed,"In an age where Martha Stewart is a business magnate, this novel couldn't possibly be more relevant! How many of us know that she is NOT a Connecticut born blue blood--she started out as Martha Kostyra in a New Jersey row house, the daughter of Polish immigrants? But the theme of American self-reinvention is as timely today as when Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby. Like Ralph Lauren, Jay Gatsby came from nothing and re-imagined himself at the top of the American good life with all of the trappings of the elite--and he actually made it happen! It is his hope, his courage, and his optimism that the character Nick loves him for, and we as readers get to watch the remarkable Jay in action through Nick's eyes (much like people watch reality shows today). But unlike modern reality shows, every sentence and scene of this book is flawlessly executed by a master author, who captures our yearning for the American dream with both extraordinary beauty and voyeuristic precision. I love every page."
506,Rebecca Robinson,"A lot of people either blow off this book or praise this book by labeling it a love story. It's so much more than that! In fact, I don't even consider it a love story. Daisy and Gatsby only fill a small, fleeting part of it. This book is a brilliant look into the lives of common personality types. It's a character study that applies to everyone's daily acquaintances. It's a character study of different kinds of men and women. I love that. Whether it was intended or not, I love reading this book over and over and each time coming back with a deeper understanding and realization of the world and people around me, those characters who are good, bad, courageous, cowardice, foolish, and beautiful. Of course, I love the time I get to spend spinning through the 1920s when I'm enveloped in the story, I love the descriptions and the imagery, and the perfect plot of it as well. But don't stop there. Always read a story for the deeper and the further; for what your mind brings out of it. If you aren't getting that from a book, well, you either are not truly reading it, or you're not reading the right book.The Great Gatsby, along with Fitzgerald's other novels, is the right book."
507,Oliver Guarnieri,"The Great Gatsby is a modernist novel written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The story is told in a first person narration by the main character Nick Carraway. Nick tells the story about his time living in West Egg next door to his mysterious, millionaire neighbor Jay Gatsby. The conflict of the story is Gatsby trying to achieve the American dream, which is symbolized by his love of the upper class Daisy Buchanan. Gatsby’s obsession with Daisy Buchanan ultimately results in his demise. This an exciting story for ages high school and older, which shows how life was back in the 1920’s. The negative aspect about this novel is shocking ending which made me sad and wanting more. Overall a great classic book that all should read."
508,Déa Massaad,"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. it eluded us then, but that's no matter, tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther....and one fine morning. So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."
509,Nicolas Simbeck,"This is one of my favorite books of all time! I love the way the author uses wordplay to really make the book come to life and make it a more interesting read. I also like how he hides discreet themes, motifs, and symbols throughout the book and once you find them, it makes the book that much more interesting. This book is also unpredictable which makes you want to read the book even more because you have no idea what is going to happen next.The characters in the book are all unique in their own special way and thats what makes this book so good. Overall I would recommend this to anyone in high school or older. This book might be difficult to fully understand if you are too young. "
510,Mr. Pollock,"There are times as an English teacher that I don't read the books I assign to my students; instead, I rely on previous readings to teach the book. I don't think this will ever be the case with Gatsby. It's just such a beautiful read. Impossible to find three concluding paragraphs that rival Fitzgerald's. "
511,Jean,"I read this many years ago, and frankly, think Nelson De Mille's The Gold Coast is better by far. It shows the dying way of life for the richest people in the tony area of Long Island called The Gold Coast (it was written in the 1980's), and how they ""struggle"" to adjust. They live in white elephants of mansions with 50 rooms, servants, and that way of life was no longer feasible. The Gold Coast tells their story in a hilarious way, told by John Sutter, a wealthy lawyer related to Walt Whitman, married to Susan Stanhope, and her insufferably snobbish family. When a suspected mob boss moves into the manse next door, he shakes up a lot more than the neighborhood. And the story, told through John's voice, sarcastic humor and wit, outweighs the Great Gatsby by far. Teens in HS would actually read this one! The Gate House is the long awaited sequel, still good, as it ties up a few loose ends, but not as funny as The Gold Coast. The view of Mob life and Rich life of snobby people is told very well here. I have written a review of The Gold Coast on http://jeanbakula.hubpages.com, as it's one of my favorite books. Not even sure if I listed it here!"
512,Riki,"Of course this book is beautifully written. Fitzgerald writes painfully beautiful characters who are flawed to the core. The faithful narrator Nick Carraway says it best at the end of the novel: ""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made..."" Although Jay Gatsby is neurotic and beyond obsessed with the love of his life, Daisy Buchanan, I wanted him to succeed from the moment he is casually introduced in the book. He is a self-made man with high ambitions and an unhealthy obsession with a woman he can't really have. As for Daisy, Fitzgerald portrays her as all perfect harmony and beautiful moments. He writes about her sultry voice throughout the book and seems every bit as enamored with her as a character as his protagonist Gatsby. In the beginning of the novel I saw Daisy as a lovely girl who married Tom Buchanan only because she couldn't be with her true love. As the book moves forward I get the distinct impression that she is playing Gatsby for a fool. By the end, I see her as careless and cruel.For a novel full of such decadence and beauty, it is awfully sad. What becomes of Jay Gatsby is a terrible fate that left me feeling empty. I wanted more of a conclusion with his ill-fated relationship with Daisy as well. If you haven't read this classic piece of American literature, you should. The prose is gorgeous and it's a wonderful story detailing the pitfalls of excess."
513,Maria Weir,My favorite book for years.
514,Gmargosian,"What can be said that hasn’t already been said about The Great Gatsby? The amazing, tragic story of the American Dream, or lack thereof, instantly captivates you in it's world painted by vivid and elegant word choice, fantastic characters, and a story you can’t pull away from. The book initially started a little slow for me, but I was almost instantly captivated when F. Scott Fitzgerald started painting the mysterious figure that was Jay Gatsby. He peaked my curiosity, slowly feeding me more and more information, taking me on a roller coaster ride for not only his backstory and future, but for all the main characters as well, showing what a man is willing to do in the name of love. All the characters as a whole: Jay, Nick, Daisy, Tom, and Jordan to name a few, were very complex characters and more than what meets the eye. They were interesting to say the least. I can’t say they’re all likable, but that’s OK. Many readers hate books when they can’t like the characters they’re investing their time in. But the characters aren’t always supposed to be likable, and when that’s the case, the tragedy hits harder than if you did like them. Overall, though, the book is great, an instant favorite, and easy to see why it’s a classic in literature, with its multiple meanings that it hits you with, leaving you contemplating your life and dreams as you know it and the American Dream itself. "
515,Cátia Santos,"It's strange... the effect this book has on us. It's fast paced, glorious but at the same time insidious. It's like everything's perfect except it's not. I am not an american but it made me think about the true nature of the so called ""American Dream"" other readers mention in their reviews.To me, The Great Gatsby is about superficiality and deceit, false expectations and dreadful dreams. It explores that in a wonderful way because it has a beacon: Carraway. He is an outsider and doesn't play the rich men games, he's the only little green light and stands aside telling us how rotten everybody is.It's a work of art, an outstanding book, I truly recomend it!"
516,Sidonie,When I started reading this book at first I wasn't interested it had a very slow beginning . I kept reading it because ever said it is an interesting book In the book Gatsby does it all for love . I really love this book .It was great it showed how far people would go for love or what they believe to be love .I don't really know if Gatsby really loved daisy of the fantasy of loving her .I never understood why he found her so fantasizing .I think This maybe be the power of love which turned into the drive for american dream and the need for money .
517,Toni,"I'd not read The Great Gatsby for a very long time. I'm sorry I waited so long to read it again. It strikes me much differently now than it did when I was a young adult. I'm sure I didn't ""get it"" then. I love it now for the way its various themes evoke the ""American vision"" of a particular time. But more so for the lushness and beauty of the language, the rich, physical descriptions.""The wind had blown off, leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbor's mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars.""And oh, that delicious description of the first party Nick attended at Gatsby's. I was immediately there, seeing it all perfectly. (Interesting that it's much harder to get a clear picture of Gatsby, himself — I do believe that's deliberate.) ""So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight."" And of course, ""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
518,Brett Cooper,"This was my first time reading one of Fitzgerald's works and ""The Great Gatsby"" did not disappoint. I had heard many different types of reviews before starting the book, so I had no idea what to expect. However, it is now one of my favorite novels that I have ever read. As many have said, there really wasn't much action or activity in the the storyline, but I think this is what makes it so significant. Instead of telling a story of what happened in these characters lives, Fitzgerald told the story of what was happening in their minds. It is from this that I have come to the conclusion that ""The Great Gatsby"" is not really a romance or a tragedy as it is a psychological depiction of these characters. This is a great read. Even if you don't take to it as well as I have, read this novel for the experience and so that you can say that you have read it. "
519,Gareth Collins,"A good book refuses to let you leave it alone. And like all addictions, out of nowhere you get a pang for it again. I returned to this book and it was everything I remembered, all over again. It's beautiful, brutal, haunting, painful and stunning. Fitzgerland is one of the finest writers of the English language that there has ever been. If I can use a football simile for a moment, he massages the English language like Diego Maradona or George Best do a football. Graceful. Skillful. Natural. He makes it his own and has the ability to do whatever he wants with it. All we can do is sit back and admire the genius of it all. There are a few books that keep calling me back to them. Simply to ride that wave again. This is one of them. "
520,Laurencia Luminos,"*May contain slight spoilers* I have a friend who is at times superior to me as literature and language goes. But she didn't like this book. She said that Gatsby and Daisy were really stupid, for lack of a better adjective. Well, of course they are! But that's not a reason to despise a book. They were childish and delusional and guided by their shared past that was in the past, no longer tangible. In the end, it was a train wreck. But what made it so amazing was the way Nick Carraway, the narrator, told it through unbiased eyes, as he tells you in the beginning that his father told him something along the lines of never judging any man. The way Nick described this rich world through his poor eyes was unique and almost reminded me of how I write (except much, much, much more sophisticated, haha). You get bits and pieces of the story through how he finds out in bits and pieces from various people, primary and secondary sources. Anyway, it's true they were all, how should I put it...stupid rich people with too much money and too much time. But the themes and descriptions made it a book worthwhile to read. And it most definitely described how the Twenties were, showing their dark side and the ultimate truth that money doesn't equal happiness."
521,Axelle,"This book explores the differences within life in higher social class as well as the lower social class. Feeling all the emotions that each character brought out especially the narrator. Everything in 1920s, the hectic, the carefree, the unknown, the pleasure. Gatsby is one of the characters that will make you never forget the lies and deception people say/do to each other. Letting you know that you should always stand firm on your own ground. Personally, I feel that everyone should read this book at least once in their lifetime."
522,Tony,"How does one review what so many have commented on. I came to read the book late. It has never been on my “to read list” so the choosing speaks to something more than just reading a classic.The book is best read before attempting the movies. Both the movies do well in enough in what they are, but the mind is the greatest movie maker, the best judge of what occurs behind the eyes of the characters is best colored by the mind. The reading will make both versions of the movie better, when watched in retrospect. The character of Jay Gatsby is best read, rather than watched. There is an enormous volume behind the story, behind his character. Nick and Daisy, Tom and Jordan, all of them are more than a screenplay can reveal in two hours. Maybe a mini-series could approach the need. The Great Gatsby is a book of beginnings and endings, of flailing at windmills and keeping alive love to the edge of sanity. Romance, in the broader definition, is far more about the soul than it is about the conditions that surround it. Jay Gatsby is that man and the story is riveting.Sure there are captivating characters throughout the book; some you will like some you will despise, but in all of them there is somebody you have known, to some extent. The setting of the book enhances the story, but the story begins and ends with Nick as much as it does Jay Gatsby. Nick is a perfect metaphor for the whole of the plot. I am not sure F Scott Fitzgerald meant that metaphor, but when the boon ends, Nick and the plot are one and the same. A fascinating read. I recommend watching both movies AFTER you read the book."
523,Melrose,"Such a short book and yet jammed packed with captivating writing, symbolism, and dynamic characters. I would not hesitate calling this book The Great American novel."
524,Elliot Black,"The Great Gatsby = The Great American Novel. Having studied this at A Level a few years ago this has become my favorite book. I feel it encompasses every thematic idea exquisitely and they are usually offset or at conflict. The idea of obsessive dangerous love, the representation of class difference and instability set against the backdrop of the American dream which conflicts with reality. Further the idea of having a dream against facing reality.Besides from this, I think there is suspense, shock and you get a real insight into the variety of persons who lived in 1920s America, whether it be the rich or the working class.I fell in love with this book completely. "
525,Brendan Foley,"The Great Gatsby movie made me try out the book and as usual it spoiled this classic piece of literature for me. The entire time I was reading it, I already knew what was going to happen next. Who was going to say what. Where they were going. Etc. However the book still held some mysteries in its symbolism that the movie touched upon but didn't go any further. Two pieces of symbolism that I found were the green light beyond Gatsby's dock and the glasses overlooking the valley of ashes. They were a reoccurring theme and eventually I connected it to Gatsby's ambition/special objects and the other to the eyes of God. Overall I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the glamour and vice filled 1920s, however, I caution the reader to wait to watch the movie!"
526,Ryan Gould,"The exploration, development and description of characters is almost unparalleled by any other book I've read. I've not yet read another Fitzgerald work, but his ability to describe a scene and his word choice is tremendous."
527,Jessie,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald was quite an adventurous book, providing both a unique setting and interesting characters within the plot line. Due to its captivating series of events, I rated this book 5 stars. It is a classical book that fed my imagination and kept me captivated with an 'older' appeal. Within the many characters involved, I found relatable and even modern qualities in which I was always curious to what the next chapter would bring, especially if Gatsby himself was involved;) I would highly recommend this book to anyone older than 14 because of the mature theme involved. Complex messages and events are in place as the story goes on, and only a mature mind could completely comprehend and understand the book for what it is meant to be. Overall, the book was a great read with a meaningful plot line that most any mature audience could relate to."
528,Josh,"This is my second time reading this book, and just...WOW. This book is spectacular, and I can definitely see why it can be called the supreme American model. The characters that he wrote are so well crafted, everyone has their own story and you can tell that Fitzgerald took the time to write out histories for his characters that go beyond the story because there just seems to be a depth to them that goes beyond what is written on the page. And they're so detestable and over the top that they become real characters. I think the thing I find most incredible is that we never really know what actually happened. This whole book is a story of perspectives. Everything in the story is either supposed, or because of something they think might have happened with little coming directly from the source. And Fitzgerald does an amazing job of giving slightly contradictory descriptions (concerning Gatsby) that helps the reader to figure out that Nick Carraway is a less than trustworthy source. That we as readers have been able to circumvent this issue and still trust him as a source gives credit to how masterful this book really is. Its an amazing book that seriously everyone should at least try once. "
529,Abigail,"I feel like this novel needs a profound review, but I'm not sure I'm up to the task - at least on a first reading and probably not even on a second or third. What I can say is that I found it a fascinating and contradictory read: it was at once compelling and oddly detached; it at once glorified love and romance and then sardonically dismissed the notions; characters at once felt deeply and nothing at all.To me, this is personified by the narrator, Nick. He at once deplores and yet apes the behaviour of his richer friends. And, above all, what is he doing there? And Gatsby? Apparently, he is at once horribly selfish and then ultimately selfless.This book is not, as some synopses would have it, a love triangle. It is a story about the American - or rather humanity's - dream, celebrating humanity's achievements and despairing at its - what? Mistakes? Follies? Unforgiveable flaws? With writing style both poetic and restrained, this is a book I'm going to return to again and again."
530,Andrea Vargas,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, follows the life of Nick Carraway. Nick moved out of Minnesota to New York, where he rents a house in a newly rich neighborhood in the West Egg district of Long Island. The story was set in the 1920s and told from the first person point of view of Nick. The book consists of tales of love, tragedy, lust, extravagant parties, death and everything else that can sum up the 1920s in the United States. It was the time for people to prosper financially, but with money comes greed and nothing good spawns from that. Nick has a mysterious neighbor by the name of Jay Gatsby. This man throws wild parties every weekend, but what most don’t see is the underlying reason that propels him to have these parties. Nick’s cousin Daisy is married to a horrid man named Tom. Tom himself is having an affair with a woman named Myrtle. What we later find out is that years ago, Gatsby and Daisy had a relationship and he was deeply in love with her. He houses all of these parties in the hope to capture Daisy’s attention and impress her. With the help of Nick and his new romantic partner Jordan, Daisy and Gatsby rekindle their affection for one another. But it is not to last. Tom is manipulative, and Daisy is a weak, heartbreaker. Tom confronts the two lovers and is quite upset at the thought that his wife could be unfaithful, even though he himself has a mistress, and manages to get Daisy to reveal to Gatsby that her true love lies with Tom not him. Many events transpire within the story, but we end up at the end with a dead mistress, a dead mistress’s husband and a dead Gatsby. F. Scott Fitzgerald, introduces the reader to the sad reality that existed during the 1920s and still exists today. Basically, people are horrible and no amount of money in the world is enough to fix that. Gatsby’s dream can be seen as a reflection of the “American Dream” and as we read in the book, this dream is unattainable and therefore, leaves many sad, alone and defeated. "
531,Violet wells,"Rivals Virginia Woolf’s The Waves for the best ending of any novel ever written –Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an æsthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.And as I sat there, brooding on the old unknown world, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning——So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."
532,Melissa,"Like many people, I read this in high school and vaguely remember liking it. Rereading it was a completely different experience. The cadence of Fitzgerald’s writing just floored me. Each sentence was beautifully crafted and the lyrical pace of the novel is astounding. He manages to tell one man’s story from three different perspectives, each time showing us a bit more of the man behind Gatsby’s mask, but never fully revealing what is true and what’s a lie. Most people know the basic plot. Nick tells the story of the one summer he spent in New York and the charismatic man who was his neighbor. Gatsby throws lavish parties and remains a mystery to all who know him. Finally Nick finds out that Gatsby whole life is devoted to reconnecting with an old flame, the now married Daisy. She is a deeply unhappy woman whose brute of a husband is cheating on her. There’s much debate over the topic of greatness when it comes to this novel. Is Gatsby great? If not, why did Fitzgerald choose this title. To me it is the idea of Gatsby that is great. It’s the persona he creates for everyone else to admire from a distance, not the man himself. He is just a man, full of dreams and disappointments. He gets everything he originally set out to achieve, but only on a superficial level. I think it’s particularly telling that Fitzgerald originally considered the title Trimalchio. “Trimalchio is a character in the 1st century AD Roman work of fiction Satyricon by Petronius. Trimalchio is a freedman who through hard work and perseverance has attained power and wealth.”**SPOILERS AHEAD**I think that despite Gatsby’s shady business dealings, Fitzgerald created a self-made man that he admired and pitied in equal parts. Gatsby is, on his surface, the picture of success. He is also one of the most thoroughly alone individuals in literature. At the end of the novel Nick desperately tries to find people to attend his funeral and of the hundreds who made it to Gatsby’s parties, no one seems able to make it. It’s truly tragic. In rereading the book I was surprised by the brazen nature of Tom and Myrtle's relationship. I had forgotten how he flaunts it, taking her to restaurants and introducing her to Nick. It’s also incredible that the title character doesn’t make his first appearance until we’re already ¼ of the way through the book. I had forgotten that Gatsby had returned home at some point to buy his father a house and show him that he was now wealthy. There’s a level of loyalty there that I admire. Even if Gatsby left his roots behind him for bigger and brighter things, he still felt the need to care for them in some way. BOTTOM LINE: There are few American novels that portray ambition and emptiness in such a visceral way. Fitzgerald’s descriptions are breathtaking. If you’re hoping to find sympathetic and relatable characters, try his autobiographical novel Tender is the Night. If you want a book where each line sings off the page and metaphors for the deflated American dream abound, this is the one. “It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again.”“Thirty--the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning brief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair.”“He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was ....”"

534,Francisco,"OBRA MAESTRA de la novela americana. Elogio de un mentiroso, de un personaje desesperado por triunfar... Deliciosamente amarga."
535,Kyndall,"I severely disliked the majority of the characters in the Great Gatsby; however, I ended up loving Fitzgerald. He changed my opinions on whether or not one person could be worth more than another, and almost painted scenes of ludicrous wealth, but mostly I was enthralled by the way he tied together sentences. Ex: (the most basic, but truly my favorite) ""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."" This is one of those books that makes you pay more attention to the author than to the story. I highly recommend it for people who like good writers better than good stories/characters."
536,Onaiza Khan,"Apart from the breathtakingly beautiful style of Fitzgerald's writing, his skill to create intense emotions is commendable. The story is a quick read and drives through some really cold hearts and crazy situations and of course the Great Gatsby. It gives you a lot to learn and to ponder. This definitely is a book everyone should read before they die and I bet it won't be easy to brush away Gatsby from your mind once you've read it."
537,Tasha,Re-read before the new movie.
538,Dr. James,"As proof that the reviews here are not peer reviewed scholarly reviews and should not be used by students who need to use reviews published in academic journals for research projects, I post the following review of the text:The Great Gatsby is about an amazing Las Vegas magician named Gatsby. His greatest trick... he is actually the ghost of founding father George Washington, whose dream was not the founding of a nation free from tyrannical British rule, but to pull bunnies out of his magic hat and to eat as much shrimp cocktail as humanly possible from the $6.99 lunch buffet at the hotel he performs his magic act. Little did George (The Great Gatsby) know, he is actually allergic to shellfish and has to hope his lovely assistant, Pinocchio, has his epinephrine (epipen) with him so he does not die. "
539,Andrew,"Original review (3 stars): Full review hereThe recurring quote I noticed when I was looking at the review page at the words ""the supreme American novel"" or something to that affect. And I can't honestly see why, I my opinion John Steinbeck's work is would be more fitting to that title. For although this isn't a truly awful book, It's not a particularly good one either. My first and biggest gripe is how much ""faffing"" about there is. Huge quantities of the book are taken up by the characters simply sitting around normally a table and talking. I mean there's nothing wrong with dialogue but their not even talking about important stuff. If it talking to progress the plot then perhaps I'd be alright with it but it not! They just go on and on about the most boring, banal and trivial stuff. There's even one occasion when the main character list all the people who went to Gatsby's party. Why? What purpose did this have? It's not like that was setting up anything later in the book, so what was the fucking point? And it goes on for a good two pages as well. An utter waste. The plot takes ages too get into. Well what little actual ""plot"" there is. The majority of the book nothing particularly important and interesting happens. There's a small bit of friction in the middle-ish of the book where two of the main characters have an argument but then that just dies away. And then finally at the end there's some drama with a car crash but by that time the books practically over. But It's not all terrible. Fitzgerald may have been shit at plot development but I will give him that certainly had a way with words. Every so often when he's describing a person or a place there are lines here and there that are really beautifully put. Subtle little lines that manage to convey so much about the character and his emotions and feelings in such short sentences. Some writers would have probably rambled on about every minute detail of that character (cough, cough, Herman Merville, cough!) But here Fitzgerald manages to construct wonderful flowing images that register perfectly with your brain.So all in all, not the great American novel and not really a great novel full stop. I suggest you should pick it up only if you are really interested in essentially completing the ""Western canon"" of classics.(EDIT 30/01/14: This review was written 2 years ago. Since then I've grown up abit. Weirdly seeing the Baz Luhrmann film made me think it was the best thing ever, even though I specifically remember not enjoying the book. But I've developed abit more of an appreciation for this book, and am currently re-reading it. I intend to do a new review after I have read it again, and I should be alot more positive. To me, this comes over as the review of a stupid, arrogant child who doesn't know jack and can't understand the subtleties of the book. So with any luck my review shall greatly improve after I've re-read it :). New Review 13/02/14: You know? This is actually really quite good. So it seems two years and the benefit of some maturity can change a book round. Perhaps one day I'll re-read Brighton Rock...oh god.Firstly, I would agree with my older review about Fitztgerald's writing, I at least got that right. FItzgerald has one of the most masterly uses of the English language I've ever come across. Beautiful, stunning, descriptions and phrases are used. The whole book has a strangely melodic, flowing quality to it, like a river of words gently and naturally flowing from a waterfall (ooh, look at that, clever simile}. Looking at other writers, like John Steinback or Cormac McCarthy, they have a savage, very blunt way of writing. But Fitzgerald has this wonderfully idiosyncratic way of writing, which I think can only be ascribed to him. For instance, let's look at a small example, in the way Tom Buchanan is described:""Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body - he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strianed the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body of enormous leverage - a cruel body""Cruel? Who uses cruel to describe a body? Well, Fitzgerald does. Would most writers think of personifying muscles? I don't think so. But Fitzgerald does, and its the perfect way to describe it. Its an unusual way of describing it, but as a description, we get it instantly. Cruel. Of course its cruel! We know it means My English lecturer said it was quite poetic, and that its a shame Fitzgerald never wrote any poetry, and I agree. Most of what he writes is very near poetry. "
540,Stephen M,An absolute classic. I could read those first two pages over and over again.

542,Andrea," Il Grande Fitzgerald, il misero Gatsby.La vicenda che racconta Fitzgerald, a ben guardare, è proprio misera.C'è un uomo povero che al di là di ogni ragionevolezza s'innamora di una riccona. La riccona sceglie liberamente di sposare un suo simile. Qualche anno dopo, stanca dell'idiota che s'è scelto, è aperta a qualsiasi possibile avventura, ed ecco che Gatsby si ripresenta, pieno dei soldi del contrabbando. Gatsby si illude di aver ritrovato l'Amore, ma ecco che proprio adesso il romanzo ingrana la quinta e la storia diventa degna d'essere raccontata.È molto significativo il punto in cui Gatsby, Daisy e Tom scoprono le carte, verso la fine. Si scopre che se Gatsby ha elevato Daisy a ideale, Daisy ha ridotto Gatsby a diversivo. Tom ne esce trionfante. Gatsby e il suo ideale assurdo, sconfitti.Per il lettore, Gatsby non è MAI grande: è insicuro, inadeguato. Il suo fascino si regge su un sorriso provato allo specchio e sul mistero che lo circonda, ma la nebbia che aleggia sul suo misero passato sarà spazzata via dalla brezza di fine estate.E Daisy non è mai un'ideale, è una donna superficiale, opportunista e debole.Per il lettore nessuno è ""grande"", la grandezza sta nelle illusioni dei personaggi, ma la cosa è trasparente al lettore, che scorge le miserie dei protagonisti celate dietro il lusso che li circonda. Si fa il tifo per Gatsby, ma sapendo da subito che fine farà."
543,Kait,CLASSIC. That is all.
544,E,"I first read this book in high school when, for some reason, it made an indelible impact on me. I've been hesitant to reread it, because I was afraid that it would lose its magic the second time round, but thankfully, I was not too disappointed. Although the Jazz Age characters at times seem shallow and frivolous, at the core of The Great Gatsby is the dark side of the American Dream. Fitzgerald's own insecurities about being a Midwesterner competing in the cosmopolitan society of Ivy League grads. and millionaire expats. haunted him. These insecurities permeate the book, but so does his hope for success and love, all of which are fused into the character of Jay Gatsby who ""believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther...And one fine morning---So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."" It's the language of The Great Gatsby that makes the book a classic. Fitzgerald carefully crafts each sentence into a gem whose beauty is timeless. "
545,Ross Cumming,"I decided to read this American Classic after recently seeing a trailer in the cinema for the new film version of the novel and it had me intrigued. I have never even seen the 1974 film version either, as I remember thinking that it just looked boring. How wrong can you be !The novel is narrated by Nick Carraway who in 1922 moves east to New York to deal in bonds and he describes the events of that summer spent in Long Island and tells the story of his mysterious neighbour Jay Gatsby. Initially I had a little difficulty reading the novel as the language and grammar used, is of its time but I soon got into the swing of it, although I did have to read several passages more than once to get their true meaning. However I loved this book and although quite short, it felt as though there was a lot more to it than I initially presumed. Fitzgerald's prose is really descriptive and I could picture all the characters and scenes in the book quite vividly in my mind's eye.I'm sure this novel will stay with me a long time and even though I've just finished it, I imagine that I will probably read it again in the future.Will be going to see the new film version and also seeking out the DVD of Robert Redford version too, to see how they compare to the book. A true classic."
546,Kassian Prior," The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is about a WWI veteran, Nick Caraway who moves to New York in search for work as a bonds salesman. He moves into a small lake house in the town of West Egg. His neighbor, who he knows none about, throws extravagant parties each weekend. Over time, upon his neighbors noticing of Nick, he personally invites him to one of his parties where they meet and Jay Gatsby more formally introduces himself. He tells a tale of a woman named Daisy Fay, who just so happens to be Nick's cousin, and the love he had for her and still does, and the life they had before he went away to become a soldier. While on his quest he became lost at sea, and he tells how he sailed with a man, Dan Cody who left behind $25,000 in his will and taught him how to be a true gentleman and the ways of the wealthy. However, his fortune was now much more than that, and there is no clear explanation as to how. Nick finds himself trying to help Gatsby pry his beloved cousin from the arms of her rather unfaithful husband Tom Buchanan, who Nick also knows, to help his new friend fulfil his past life that he so much desires. As Gatsby's wishes slowly become true, the mistress of Tom dies in a car accident. The woman's husband comes after Gatsby who he believed had been responsible for his wife's death, and kills him. Fitzgerald's main intent is to show the danger of love. Love can leave you blind, as it does with Gatsby. He stopped living for himself and started living to love Daisy, who, was in a sense, already out of his reach and only really cared about money. I suppose that Fitzgerald best shows this very message when Nick tells him that the past is something you cannot repeat and Gatsby replies, ""Can't repeat the past? Why, sure you can!"" He imagines that Daisy still loves him, as he knew she did before, and that they could have their life they had before back, but Nick tells him that you can't. But why? The answer is simple, all Daisy cares about at this point is wealth, and it makes her greedy, """"Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily. "".They're such beautiful shirts,"" she sobbed, her voice muffled in the think folds. ""It makes me sad because I've never seen such – such beautiful shirts before."""" She is in love with his shirts, his grand home, his fortune, not him, and that is what Gatsby is unable to recognize. He is blind to what should be so clear. Perhaps, that is what his death symbolizes when his back is turned to the gun, he can't see what is really going on and it hurts inside, and kills him.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. I love how Fitzgerald left the book open for interpretation, for example at one point in the book Gatsby tells Nick, ""If there's anything that you want just ask for it, old sport."" I think this so to symbolize both physical and mental aspects of 'wanting something'. Gatsby is rich and can give him almost anything Nock's heart could desire, but also Jay recognizes that Nick has been there for him so dearly, that morally he will be there for him regardless of what he needs. I've just really come to enjoy the open tone the book has and how you can really understand it as you please because at the core it really is simply a great story."
547,Cathy,"Loved this book for the language, the gorgeous descriptions of beautiful people and gardens and mansions, and for Gatsby: his decency, his ""old sports,"" and his strict allegiance to honor."
548,Grace C,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is the story of the mysterious Jay Gatsby who lives alone in his Long Island mansion. The story is told by Gatsby’s neighbor and friend, Nick Carraway. Around once a month Gatsby throws an extravagant party where rumors swirl about his unknown past. No one knows why or how he came to be, but everyone wants to know. Gatsby has a fierce obsession with his first love, Daisy, who has a uncaring and unkind husband, Tom. She is the motivation for all of Gatsby’s choices because he dreams that one day he can win her back, and they can be together. Fitzgerald’s message is that the burning desire for wealth consumes people by causing them to lose themselves. Gatsby literally transforms when “it was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat” (98). Gatsby is exposed to the great wealth of Dan Cody, and wants to have the same. Gatsby changing his name is a metaphor for the shift in his character. A name is one’s identity, so when it changes, the identity must change as well.	Another theme of this book is extravagance. For Gatsby’s parties, “a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby’s enormous garden,” and “by seven the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-pieced affair, but whole pitiful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums” (40). Extravagance in an excessive manner, such as this, can be distracting. This display of wealth is used to mask the secrets that lurk around Gatsby’s rise to power. They give people something to marvel at instead of him; it allows this superficial culture to thrive in his favor. However the rumors still circulate the parties. Rumors show the suspicious and spiteful side of human nature. One guest says, “‘it’s more that he was a German spy during the war,’” and another says “‘I’ll bet he killed a man’” (44). This theme of rumors show the crooked ways of people. It is ironic that they spread these nasty rumors about him as they enjoy his extravagant parties. Tom was the most unlikeable character because he held a double-standard in his relationship with Daisy. Tom has a girlfriend that he sees frequently, but he “was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around…” (103). He even admitted that he wanted a divorce, but he still is upset about Daisy possibly wanting one too. Tom is thy type of person that dreams to be wanted by everyone, but does not want to have to put in any effort. He wants his wife to be torn apart when she finds out that he wants to leave her, so he is angry when she is fine. This is a cruel way to be. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book."
549,Thomas Schrepfer,"I suspect that my soul is not good enough for heaven, for the way it thrills as Tom sends Daisy home in Jay's car, and how it shudders at Nick's last compliment."
550,Stephanie Gregorio,"The Great Gatsby was an amazing book. It had a very slow and quite boring beginning. The characters are amazing! All of the characters in the book have major parts in how the story plays out. Personally my favorite character is Gatsby. He is the protagonist and his character is very admirable. He fulfill the dream that many Americans wish to have but the end shows that people who have it all truly don't. I didn't like how the story wasn't told from the protagonist's point of view because we, the readers, only see and hear what Nick, who the story's point of view is based on, see's and hear's from Gatsby. I would have loved to know what Gatsby was think and feeling in one of the main key points of the story. This book is filled with color imagery and the colors have big meaning throughout the book. The end was really good but I'm sad that it ended the way it did. I believe that there should have been a sequel but we're obviously not going to get one. But overall, I would recommend this book to many of my peers. "
551,Charley,"The Great Gatsby is one of the few classics that I actually read all the way through and loved all the way through. Gatsby was written with the perfect mix of the older writings' ways like Tolkien with the endless description that sometimes just bores me to death, and the fast-paced novel like today's writings. I loved this writing style, and I am actually considering picking up perhaps a few of his other books to see if he always writes like this. His writing, I'm pretty sure, revolutionized everyone else's writings. The story of the Great Gatsby is pretty well known, but I was still surprised by what went on in the story. There is so much outright symbolism as well that I don't have time to go through it all. I believe this book really parallels F. Scott Fitzgerald's actual life, and the guys in the story are different versions of himself. Gatsby is who he actually was, and then Tom is who he wanted to be. Nick is a different version of Fitzgerald as well. He really was a brilliant writer. Daisy was Fitzgerald's version of the golden girl he had originally fallen in love with, but then Myrtle was the one he got stuck with. There's not much to really talk about besides you just have to read the book. It is a classic for a reason. "
552,Bellagbear,"This book is so much different than the first time I listened to it. The first time is years ago and in the meantime I am changed as a person, so I understand the book in a whole different way. I am glad to see I gave the book five stars the first time, because that means I got some good out of it the first time as well.Now I read the book like this:New York in that time is full of fake and plastic people (phoney's) who have no thought of their own and just live their life without considering the consequences of their action. The 'writer' of the book, mr. Carraway, realises that throughout the book. Especially the fact that Gatsby as the stereotype of an artificial man comes out as one of the only truly sincere people in the book is fascinating. This makes me think about society today. Maybe the most sincere people are the ones who create an image out of themselves in order to achieve their goals, especially because they have done away with the pretence of being original themselves. All the other people also live by a created image, but sub-consciously and are thus much more careless and destructuve. The Great Gatsby is certainly a book with many layers and is therefore interesting to be read by everyone to see the different interpretations."
553,Haili,"The Great Gatsby is one big foreshadow about our modern times and struggles. Gatsby being the main character is explained by his loves, deceits and brilliance. The book starts off really confusing and that is my biggest petpeive about books. But soon you find out that Gatsby's neighbor Nick Carraway is narrating. The plot takes place in a tale of impossible love in the summer of 1922 and has an interesting story line about a man desperately trying to find his long-lost soulmate. Gatsby having been deprived of finding his soulmate named Daisy, throws extravagant parties at his mansion in hope of Daisy attending one. Gatsby then finds out that he has a new neighbor Nick Carraway and invites him to one of his parties. Eventually Gatsby finds out that Nicks' cousin is Daisy and tries to get close with Nick by taking him out to lunch. But Nick being kind-hearted tells Gatsby that he will set them up with nothing in return and sets a date for them to meet. Soon the two heart-broken soulmates meet and instantly fall in love all over again. :) Nick is taken in by all the wonderful events around him and feeds his extravagant dreams. This was definitely one of my favorites and I love the unique emphasis the author has when the events are explained. I would definitely recommend this book :) "
554,Ismael Acevedo,"Una gran novela, que habla de hasta donde la obsesión de obtener algo puede cegar al punto de no ver lo que se tiene que sacrificar para lograrlo, como en este caso Jay Gatsby persiguiendo a quien el cree estar enamorado, Daisy, una mujer egoísta, caprichosa y voluble, que piensa únicamente en su satisfacción inmediata, lo que quiere lo consigue igual que Gatsby, pero sin poner empeño o esfuerzo, ni medir las consecuencias, es en ese juego que Gatsby pierde todo incluso la vida, extraño que alguien que es la representación del ""self-made man"" termine siendo arrastrado por los carpichos de su último objetivo, y es tanta su confianza en lograrlo que no ve la realidad. Este libro se une a la lista donde el motivo amoroso del libro termino odiando."
555,Cassie,"The Great Gatsby is a novel of many themes going on. It uses a theme of the American Dream throughout kinda like a rags-to-riches story. A young mysterious man who becomes a millionaire, throws parties every weekend, and lives right across he bay from Mrs. Daisy Buchanan. A man of whom no one knows much about, but just the rumors they've been told. This novel goes through the shallowness, corruption, and the lengths people will go through to achieve success and acceptance. The Great Gatsby is a romantic and cynical novel. The novel is placed in the view of Nick Carraway who is the neighbor of J. Gatsby and is second cousin once removed of Daisy Buchanan. This novel is carried around the adultery of the married Tom and Daisy Buchanan. Gatsby is madly in love with Daisy and while Daisy just wants to run away, Gatsby doesn't want to leave because everything he's ever done is for Daisy.There was a lot of foreshadowing throughout the novel with the green light, the clock sitting on nick mantel, superficial love, a the characters take place in foreshadowing Gatsby's death, and materialism. I thought this book did a great job in really showing the truth behind the characters, their shallowness, how materialism controlled them. One of the best lines in the novel that does this is ""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy---they smashed up things up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up their messes they had made..."" I guess Daisy's love for Gatsby should have been seen as materialistic from the very beginning because ""They're such beautiful shirts,"" she sobbed. ""It makes me sad because I've never seen such- such beautiful shirts before."" This book was very enjoyable and probably the fastest Ive ever gotten through a book i had to read for school. The novel kind of drags you in and makes you continuously read until the end. "
556,Carmen8094,"Il grande Gatsby è un romanzo assolutamente affascinante.Ambientato negli anni '20 dello scorso secolo, ne racchiude tutta l'atmosfera, con scene di una incredibile plasticità, eppure anche impalpabili e languide (una su tutte, quella delle due donne sul divano di casa Buchanan durante una torrida giornata).Eppure la storia è quanto mai attuale, trattando temi universali e senza tempo, come il sogno, la cui potenza e il desiderio di realizzare il quale sono capaci di plasmare un'intera vita.E' ciò che succede proprio a Gatsby, di cui ogni azione mira solo ed unicamente a ricongiungersi con Daisy, il suo amore mai dimenticato, una donna tuttavia diversa da lui per mentalità e classe sociale. Per diventarne degno, per diventare ""grande"", Gatsby si corromperà in mille modi, perché l'unica cosa che davvero conta è che il suo sogno, sia incorruttibile.La sola speranza di vedere Daisy lo spinge a dare grandiose feste alle quali non partecipa, a cui intervengono persone che non lo conoscono, che si muovono, ridono e di divertono mentre lui, da lontano, le guarda in silenzio, da solo.Un altro tema del romanzo è infatti la solitudine, e la vita di Gatsby è fatta, fondamentalmente, di questo. La persona più vicina a lui si rivelerà infatti un vicino -lo stesso che ci narra la storia- conosciuto da poco, tutti quelli che accorrevano alle sue feste non esiteranno ad abbandonarlo, e colei per la quale aveva vissuto non lo accompagnerà nemmeno durante il suo ultimo viaggio.http://iltesorodicarta.blogspot.it/"
557,Frank,"I didn't go and buy myself a pink suit, but I have seriously over-hauled my shirt collection (and one of them is pink...)Do reviews of books get any clearer? Oh, alright. I read this first (probably around the age of 11 because I'd read everything else on the bookshelf) and was in pursuit of excitement and adventure. How my 11 year old self got to the end of the book I'll never know as it was well beyond my ken of what was going on. I the returned to it about three years ago, driven by the contending engines of Baz Luhrmann and state examinations (my students, not mine!). It is such a swooning, jiving, intoxicated confection. It's mirrored surfaces, resonant shallows and throwaway confessions are all handled with genius and poise. Fitzgerald seems to have second sight as to how much is too much, and pares everything back. The characters are psychologically real, and drawn into a terrible struggle where each tries blindly to ignore the other's common plight. I'm definitely in the throes of a Gatsby moment- I have borrowed the Tim Robbins audio-version to get an alternate take on Fitzgerald's master-piece."
558,Tameka,"I wish I had a Time Turner so I could back in time and smack my American Lit teacher in the face for making us read ""The Scarlet [barf] Letter"" instead of this amazing book. I loved everything about this story, the prose, the characters, the setting. I did not love any of the characters at all. Not even a little bit but watching their tragic eltist BS play out was incredibly entertaining for me. I understand why this book is considered the great American novel and I can't wait to read it again now that I have the knowledge of how amazing it is. I really want to see how the words hit me the second time around."
559,John Walther,"F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby is a striking page turner that features many exciting plot twists and an excellent story line. This fiction novel expresses the idea that a man’s wealth often expresses how that man is seen in the rest of society.Jay Gatsby is what you would consider a classy man. He often refers to people as “old sport” and he also throws the most magnificent parties in his mansion. But as intriguing as he sounds, he is also keeping his past a secret making him somewhat mysterious to people. Nick Carraway is a neighbor of Gatsby, and this story is about Nick’s interactions with Gatsby and his past.F. Scott Fitzgerald novel was definitely interesting because it was a great story, but it also expressed this idea of how deceiving money can be to us and how much attention we give it.Overall, this book I thought was terrific. It’s a quick read, but every word kept me wanting to read more. If you love mysteries and also a bit of romance this definitely a story for you."
560,Kelley,I loved this book in high school so I bought it and read it all the time
561,Cristina,"Ho riletto Il grande Gatsby per un mucchio di motivi diversi. Il primo è che è un libro veramente molto bello, bello nel dettaglio, con frasi così melodiche da incantare, e bello in generale, ripensando a tutto il libro io immagino un quadro, pieno di particolari affascinanti che però non catturano troppo l'attenzione, ti lasciano la possibilità di gustartelo tutto. Il secondo motivo è che usciva il film al cinema e io vorrei vederlo, e nel vederlo vorrei proprio cogliere anche le infinitesime differenze dal libro, quindi una mera operazione di rinfresco della memoria. Il terzo motivo è che sono una lettrice vorace. Con alcuni libri non mi limito a leggere, ma mi ingozzo, e questo mi fa perdere delle cose. Basterebbe imporsi di leggere più tranquillamente, ma non mi riesce, esattamente come non riesco a smettere di mangiare le cuticole (pellicine, per parlare come mangio) sulle mie povere martoriate dita. Oltretutto se mi imponessi un modus legendi avrei la sensazione di forzarmi in una delle cose che mi piacciono di più nella vita, quindi continuo serenamente a fagocitare. Però questa volta, con Gatsby, visto che è l'ennesima volta che lo leggo, sento proprio il bisogno di fare con calma. Poche pagine per volta, di solito la sera prima di dormire. Oltretutto mi sento bene, con Gatsby sul comodino. È il suo habitat naturale. Magari potrei pensare di tenercelo sempre. Perché magari Gatsby è un po' pacchiano, ma Francis, my god, lui è veramente elegante. Quell'eleganza impossibile da simulare, l'eleganza di chi, anche indossando un capo del mercato da 5 euro, pare appena uscito da una sartoria (non che indossi qualcosa di meno che prezioso, eh, faccio per dire che c'è chi smagliante ci nacque e lui, modestamente, ci nacque).Io a Gatsby voglio bene, e gli voglio bene in particolare quando guarda Daisy e si accorge che la sua forza sta venendo meno e capisce che tutto quello che ha fatto è inutile, ha montato un grandioso immenso baraccone, ma non ce l'ha fatta, Daisy gli si è avvicinata, si sono toccati, poi però la marea l'ha riportata indietro. E vorrebbe dubitare, si affida a Nick, vorrebbe che lo convincesse che ha capito male, la vista gli si è offuscata, non è vero che la luce verde se ne sta fluttuando lontana (era riuscito a farla emergere praticamente dal nulla, l'aveva vista diventare sempre più luminosa, quanto grande deve essere stato lo stupore e la disperazione?), sono i suoi occhi velati a essere incapaci.Ma poi, davvero, Gatsby sarebbe riuscito a sopportare una Daisy che in un momento, piccolo, aveva amato Tom? Perché Daisy non sa amare, ma Gatsby, pur sapendolo intimamente, non lo ammetterebbe mai. I coniugi Buchanan se ne vanno lasciando lo sfacelo dietro di loro, e noi rimaniamo con Jay. Nick non lo sa forse, ma al funerale di Jay siamo veramente in tanti."
562,Emily,"This time around I'm upgrading it to 5 stars! This is my third time through Gatsby, and I feel that I am at the perfect age to really appreciate this work. I am confident enough in myself and my values to really look at the characters and recognize their flaws, while understanding that it doesn't make them horrible people. Even Tom has an ounce of compassion down there somewhere. Through this year in medical school I have been learning that just because a patient is sometimes irresponsible or less disciplined than I would be, they are still worthy of our help. And that's how I see Daisy and Gatsby. They are hopeless romantics that never have both feet in reality, and no one is surprised that it doesn't work out. But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't cheer for them all the same. I think I missed this point the first time because Fitzgerald's writing is beautifully subtle, and the romance is not as obvious as in most love stories. But in the end that is what it is, a love story between two flawed, real humans with a tragic ending, as all great love stories have. P.S. I CANNOT wait til the movie! Oh Leo..."
563,notgettingenough ,I just can't imagine Jay Gatsby getting his party supplies from Amazon....so he says goodbye to goodreads.http://alittleteaalittlechat.wordpres...
564,Logan Baxlye,"This was a very interesting book told from the POV of a man who almost serves as a catalyst for the entire novel. Nick Carraway provides the perfect look into Jay Gatsby's world. Nick's mysterious next door neighbor throws the best parties in all of West Egg, and Nick receives an invitation, but doesn't know why. When the character of Jay Gatsby is first revealed, he tells Nick of his love for Daisy Buchanan, Nick's cousin. Nick tries to set the two up, and succeeds in doing so. The ongoing affair between Daisy and Gatsby rock the lives of everyone around them, most so Tom, Daisy's husband, and Nick, who is witness to the twisted events that unfold in the novel. This great american novel is one of the most shocking things I have ever read. It is realistic, insightful, and grand. "
565,Shelby,"(There may be spoilers.)I’ve said this before, over and over, but I think it will always be true that books are labeled as “classics” for good reason. The Great Gatsby has certainly earned its keep among great and canonical literature.When I first heard of this book, I wasn’t the least bit interested in its subject matter, and especially not in its setting; I’d never been a fan of the Jazz Age, and I had no sympathy for the filthy rich. But having gotten over that initial judgement and finally read the book, I’m glad I did. As much as it’s a portrait of the Roaring Twenties, and as much as it reveals of the upper class and the Flappers, it is also a story about how fleeting time is, how inspiring the American Dream is, and how insidious the idea of wealth (or, more appropriately, gold) is.As for the symbolism: The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, as I’ve found, were significant in that they saw everything, like the eyes of God: they watched Nick as he entered the valley of ashes for the first time, they saw the first party Nick ever went to in New York, and they saw the violence that decided the ending of the book. The color yellow/gold can be interpreted to represent the wealth that Gatsby and Daisy loved, or, as the top comment on a vlogbrothers video review said, corruption, and was set to oppose other symbolic colors in the book. White represents, of course, innocence, and was seen in Jordan and Daisy’s dresses, flowers throughout the story, and Gatsby’s first car (in which he met Daisy). Black represented ending, and was used to emphasize how bad Gatsby’s party went the one time that Daisy attended. Blue, I think, had a lot to do with simply opposing yellow — it was used a lot around Nick, and in flashbacks of Gatsby’s past. And any time that clocks were mentioned, the reader knew to think on the idea of time…The main theme of the book is that “Time is fleeting.” Jay Gatsby’s struggle throughout the whole story was that he wanted the past to come back so bad that he did everything that was in his power to do to try and bring his memories back to life. He loved Daisy so much that he bought a house in such a position that hers was just across the bay, and tried to get her attention by showing off his wealth and throwing a gratuitous number of grand parties. One theory was that he didn’t love Daisy, but had fallen in love with her money because he’d been so broke; though I don’t agree with this, I think that it’s possible that only the parties were meant for Daisy, and perhaps his house was another attempt at living in the past — perhaps it was to recreate the splendor he had seen at her family’s mansion that had demonstrated her wealth. And Gatsby was never able to relive the past, nor was he able to escape it and move on. Time was fleeting for him and had flown away from him, and this was his flaw.F. Scott Fitzgerald is a great writer, and as much as he was never happy with the final result of his book, I think it is fantastic. His writing style breathed life into the story itself and created a beautiful picture in the readers’ minds of the Roaring Twenties and its bright lights and dangerous undertones. The characters were each a different personification of the American Dream that lives on even today, in that it can be both corrupting and liberating depending on how one goes about achieving it.And maybe this Dream isn’t just to be wealthy, but to reach toward Gatsby’s green enchanted light in the distance, and to find the glory of the past in the yellow light of the future.This book makes you think deeply, as all great books should, and for that, at least, I commend Fitzgerald. I love his flawed characters, buried symbolism, and beautiful story. It’s not the sort of book that I’m so in love with I can’t breathe, but nevertheless I loved it, and certainly plan to read more by Fitzgerald in the future.Please, do take the time to read this book."

567,Chance Murray,"Book Review: The Great Gatsby	“The Great Gatsby”, by F. Scott Fitzgerald is one of my favorite books of all time because the creative and simplicity displayed in the story. This book is more a story that is aimed towards young adults in high school. The book takes place in the 1920’s that was time when the economy was great and everyone was living a great life. The book is about the narrator, Nick Carraway, who just moved to New York, and he moved to a millionaire named Jay Gatsby. Jay Gatsby is infamous for throwing wild parties every weekend. There are a lot of rumors about who Gatsby is but no one truly knows, and Nick is very curious to find out who this character is. Nick finds out that although Gatsby may have everything in the world, he is not fully satisfied. Long ago a woman who left home when he went to war broke his heart, and he is determined to find her again. This is the reason for all of the extravagant parties. Gatsby hopes that she will pop up one weekend. Later on Gatsby finds out that Nick is related to the woman that he is searching for and tries his best to make their love respired. Throughout this suspenseful book there are many incidents that describe the American way of living. One message that is important to relay from this book is that people will only use you for their benefits. People loved Gatsby for his parties, but once he passed away there one there for his funeral. "

But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever. ""- Nick p. 160.

569,Baahaarmast,"صفحه ی 85، آن جا که نیک مینویسد: ""هرکس به گمان خود صاحب اقلا یکی از صفات حسنه است و آن صفت در من این است: خودم یکی از چند آدم واقعا درستکاری هستم که به عمرم شناخته ام"" حوصله ام داشت سر میرفت. یعنی یک جاهایی از کتاب تا همین صفحه بود ک مرا وادار به علامت زدن، یا دوباره و چندباره خواندن میکرد، اما انگار ک تو داشتی به حاشیه ای زیبا چنگ می انداختی و نویسنده تو را وارد داستان نمیکرد. نمیگذاشت که بروی داخل ِ داستان و از طرفی ولت هم نمیکرد. اما همین که از صفحه ی 85 میروی به صفحه ی 86 و فصل 4 را آغاز میکنی، نویسنده چنان ""بتمرگ"" ِ غرایی به تو میگوید که جز ادامه دادن و ادامه دادن و یک نفس خواندن، چاره ای نداری! گتسبی ِ بزرگ حالا یکی از کتاب های مورد علاقه ی من است. به خاطر فضاسازی هایش. دیالوگ های کوتاه و تند و تیزش. نوازش سیلی های سطورش. و داستان ِ به غایت هیجان انگیزش. خوشحالم که قبل از دیدن فیلم و تاثیر موسیقی، فضا و بازی ِ هر بازیگر و حقه های هر کارگردانی، گتسبی ِخود ِ اسکات فیتس جرالد ِ پور سان آو ئه بیچ را تجربه کردم.همین."
570,Mohammed Al-Garawi,"An enigmatic symbolic masterpiece. This all time classic has a beautiful mix of the delicacy of the dialogues in Pride and Prejudice, the narrative of The Catcher In The Rye, and the rise from nothing to supreme wealth and status in The Count of Monte Cristo.The story might strike anyone as a pointless narrative or a sad love story, but it's more than that. It's a symbolic manifestation of the American Dream and the moral decay in the east of the United States along with its impact on the culture and the lifestyle in the 1920s. It is full of profound images and themes. At some point, the narrative implicitly and brilliantly establishes a connection between the weather and the emotional atmosphere of the story. Meaning that, as the geographical settings of the book correspond to particular characters and themes, the weather corresponds to the plot. I KNOWWWW!!! RIGHT?!!One of the most interesting ideas discussed by the book is that the rose has been a conventional symbol of beauty throughout centuries of poetry. However, it isn't inherently beautiful, and that people only view it that way because they choose to do so. And that exact concept can be applied to pretty much anything in the world.I really loved this book.Absolutely a favorite."
571,Len,"I don't think you can know what it means to be an American until you've read this book. Read the last five paragraphs, pasted below, and just try to resist reading the rest of the book.""On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand.""Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors' eyes--a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.""And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning----""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
572,Rashmika,"After watching the film, you expect the book to be huge, but it is actually really skinny!And it is like the film in many ways.One of my favourite parts is that it ends the same way as the movie, and the style of writing is the same.The book draws you in, and you just can't put it down! You feel as if you are there, in the moment. Either if you are in the car with Gatsby or lying on a couch and talking to Daisy.But one of the things that I realised after watching the film and reading the book, I absolutely hated the character Daisy. The was she acted at the end, not caring about Gatsby being dead (spoiler)after all that he did for her, and she just drifted back into her careless life.(the book really emphasises the point that I am trying to make :) "
573,Ethan,"The Great Gatsby is a fabulous work of American Literature. The story itself is entertaining to read, but the really great part about The Great Gatsby is the issues that it discusses. The Great Gatsby discusses the fundamental american issue of class based on your family and ancestry and F. Scott Fitzgerald does a great job of conveying everything that is wrong with the system in this story about a young man named Jay Gatsby."
574,Chris Salzman,"It's been a good 10 years or more since I've read this book. I picked it up again because the movie came out and someone somewhere mentioned that they were on a subway and saw three separate people reading it on the subway. It seemed like a good opportunity to pick up a book that most people know because they were ""forced"" to read it and found it packed with enjoyable bits, or treat it as the book that killed literature for them. My expectation was that I'd pick at it a bit and put it down after a few pages, instead I read it more or less in the past three days. I found myself savoring it. There's the excellent plot, well-paced and harrowing. A synopsis makes the book sound like a pretty good soap opera, but Fitzgerald manages to keep it together well, always giving a context for actions that is wholly consistent with the characters' personalities. And then there's the beautiful writing. There's a reason people quote this book and why it gets taught in school. Fitzgerald has a mastery over imagery. Phrases that should be clumsy, that teeter on the edge of showmanship, just fit. They only draw attention to themselves in that they are summations of the human condition, or stand alone on their own beauty. If you want an example of bad writing, just try your hand at describing anything in the tone that Fitzgerald uses for The Great Gatsby. It's difficult to pull off and he's a master at it. The ending makes much more sense outside of the world of high school. I remember liking it for the way it came together and for the pretty little sentences towards the end, but once you've experienced some real regrets and mistakes in life it's easier to understand the thrust of the book. That it's all about Gatsby--and to a lesser extent Daisy--trying to redo parts of their lives. Hoping that changing the past will remake the future into what they want it to be. There's a certain amount of living you need to do in order to understand Gatsby's folly. To recognize in yourself the seeds of the terrible decisions that Gatsy made in order to chase after an unattainable version of his life that would never be."
575,Dan,"Sure, you read this in high school, but you don't remember much of it, except that it's about the excesses of the super-rich of the 1920s on Long Island. My question was, in the 2013 environment of high income inequality, is this classic suddenly relevant again?My short answer: No, except maybe sort-of.My long answer contains spoilers, so...Spoilers below.First, the language in this book is outstanding. Fitzgerald can, in a few, pithy words, beam an entire Norman Rockwell image directly into your mind. The book is short, but the imagery in fantastic. I read the audio book, and the performance was very colorful and enjoyable.While it's not really obvious until the latter parts of the book, the story is really a conflict between old money and the nouveau riche. Gatsby's hubris for trying to join the society of wealth, so that he can win the love of a rich girl (which, by the way, what was he thinking?) turns out to be his undoing.So, is this relevant today? I think not, simply because we don't have a class of nouveau riche. It's not the income inequality, it's the opportunity gap. The book was published in 1925. At that time, we were in the midst of a stock market boom, combined with Prohibition, which enabled vast financial opportunities for law-breakers. (In fact, Gatsby made his money in this sort of crime.) Now, we're not in a stock market boom, and our problem is that there isn't enough opportunity to break into the wealth class. Sure, there are individual Mark Zuckerbergs, but not enough of them to make a class.On the other hand, the role of old wealth and privilege is relevant today, which leads to interesting discussion of the character of Tom Buchanan.A new film adaptation starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire is set to release in May, 2013. So start reading now if you want to be one of those ""The book was better"" types."
576,Karielle,"First read: Senior year of high school. Honors literature. Much-anticipated. Slow start was confusing. Story seemed to drag. Sparknotes became my best friend. Didn't enjoy until the last three chapters. Last page solidified Fitzgerald's status as ""literary genius"" in my mind.Second read: Freshman year of college. English writing. Read first half on a plane. Kept laughing aloud and disturbing other passengers. Read second half as soon as I got home. Jordan Baker is one of my all-time favorite characters. Fitzgerald is still brilliant.Third read: Two days after second read. *heart pounds wildly*"
577,Amina |  PAPER/PLATES,"here’s no way that at fourteen, I could ever really know what freedom meant. By twenty-four, I’m a little closer. The thrill of freedom lives somewhere in the underlying fear of failure, the chance that everything could come crashing down around you—and yet doesn’t. The thrill isn’t opportunity, it’s missed opportunity. It’s failure.At fourteen, I had no idea what it was like to lose yourself to the glowing lure of a stiff drink and a puff of smoke. At fourteen, I had no idea that success itself is as intoxicating as any drug. I knew what success was, in some abstract way, but never imagined or really ever thought about what the whirlwind of success, and excess was actually like.Read the rest of our thoughts on why high schoolers are the wrong audience for this book: http://www.paperplatesblog.com/2013/0..."
578,Annalisa,"The book starts off a little slow and I wasn't quite sure what direction it was taking, but by the end I'm left with such a melancholy feeling I wanted to devour it again the minute I closed it. Yes, it has it's place as an American classic.I could feel the desperation of the American Dream in this short novel. Poor Gatsby, who dedicated his life to being good enough for a shallow girl with a magical voice when old money would never accept cheap money. His parties were so needy it was depressing. I could visualize all those moochers who feed off his wealth for a good time when they were never there to accept him and even gossiped about him in his own home. Although Fitzgerald couldn't have known at the time how the opulence of the twenties would crash into the Depression of the thirties, I could feel a warning in his display of the overindulgence, the inability to see past oneself, the complete lack of moral and social consequence. If only we could learn from the past.Not a single character in this book is likable, except for maybe Nick--who was too inactive to be too likable but I still liked his counterbalance to the overindulgence and his reality check on the American Dream--and Jordan who isn't so much likable as much as interesting. But all the characters are strong and quirky and classic. I particularly hated Tom. I was so angered with him at his last meeting with Nick that I wanted to strangle him. I wanted to see some fear or regret in him, but he couldn't see past his own nose. He couldn't see that the pain he felt was the same pain he caused. So shallow and self-involved it was almost sad. He and Daisy deserved each other.Daisy was never worth the pedestal Gatsby put her on. Since I read this in high school, I've always pictured Daisy Buchanan when I think about unrequitted love, especially love that has warped over time to be something bigger than it originally was, something unattainable and unrealistic. I hated the way Daisy used up Gatsby and then spit him out when he wasn't worth anything to her anymore. And I hated that Gatsby let her, that he put her on that pedestal and spend five years trying to be something for her instead of for himself or his family or something other than greed and childish love. Gatsby is such a great tragic character, not only because of what happens to him, but because he is so naive about the wealth and people around him. It's what makes Fitzgerald's irony and satire of the American Dream so desperate.I loved the New York Fitzgerald paints and his scarce analogy, leaving us the reader to define the novel. I loved this book in high school so much I read an anthology of F. Scott Fitzgerald's short stories (my favorite of which is Bernice Bobs Her Hair and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button). Along with Catcher in the Rye, I consider The Great Gatsby to be the Quintessential American novel and F. Scott Fitzgerald one of my favorite authors.Reread 11/21-11/28/11"

580,Masouma,"I've seen the movie before reading the book; well both are amazing honestly. It's the only story that was well and as good in movies, as in the book."
581,Abrar,"Im almost done with this book. while i was reading it in public, I felt sorry for people around me for they (although sitting next to me) could't feel this splendid feeling I got while reading this book. it is so different from the other novels I've read recently; (shorter, lighter and full of surprises) which is another reason why i liked it so much. (07/17/2012)My fav part was when Gatsby's father shows Nick his son's story book. "
582,Jennifer Brinkmeyer,"This book earns a four from me because the language was beautiful enough at parts that I added quotes to goodreads and it left me troubled. Sure, there were things that irritated me:1. Nick is kind of lame to follow around (though Tobey Maguire I think will make his lameness more endearing).2. Daisy, who seemed so elevated and magnanimous, ultimately found herself deciding not to decide. While I appreciate that this feels very realistic for a woman, I wanted so much more for her. Her silent exit off-stage made me resent the limitations of the narrator to provide me with her fate.3. Self-awareness--sometimes it felt like the author was too aware of what he wanted to write about, what point he was trying to make. For example, Tom is introduced as being racist, though the narrator makes sure to inform us how idiotic Tom is because he's racist. My guess is this situation was used to show how ill-informed Tom was. However, I already knew that about him. It seemed like Fitzgerald decided he wanted to talk about race so he plugged that in to get people to think about it. I appreciate that he's doing this at a time when it would take some cajones to do so, but Tom became so unappetizing all around that his character ceased to be dimensional. I understand that Tom himself is not supposed to be dimensional, but I'm a reader, so I should at least be able to see some facets of character instead of a caricature.But this is a great American novel. It tackles so many American themes. The beginning drew me in with its attention to social justice and the end finished strong with the idea of America's past and future. The characters were in general silly and trivial, but it made the point and for me didn't go over the edge. Ultimately, it asked more questions than it answered and that is what I most appreciate. What separates the past from the future? What dreams are worth dreaming and at what cost? What is the nature of friendship and marriage? Do the ends justify the means?Fitzgerald is almost prophetic in this novel, published four years before the Great Crash of 1929. If only we had someone like him now..."
583,Charmie,"Nick, the narrator. Some sort of an ""accidental right hand man"" or ""best bud"" of The Great Gatsby, Jay Gatsby—sort of the ""Godfather"" here. I knew I had seen a movie somewhat related to this novel, but I just couldn't get my hands on it. Wait. *Googles*................I give up. I couldn't find it, but I found a trailer for the movie adaptation of the novel to be out May 2013. And shit... I have no words to describe the excitement I feel right now. I hope it wouldn't suck. Would definitely check it out! Because I enjoyed reading the book today. I started and finished it today and I really enjoyed it. The writing was very poetic and the choice of words and everything else were beautiful. In my opinion. Although Nick's character was aloof most of the times, which I find really annoying, Gatsby's made me rattle and shake inside. Especially when he developed another sense of character as the story progressed. It's hard not to adore the miseries, tragedies, conflicts and the downpour of emotions in the novel, it was written creatively. The novel was ""attractive"", if I am asked to describe it.I am not really good at critiquing especially classics like this but I really loved it. It was good. I thought I wouldn't but I guess I just did."
584,Elaine,"Some think it is cliche to love this book, but some cliches exist for a reason. In this case, the reason is that Fitzgerald's Gatsby is a masterful book. It's hard to even read other novels after finishing Gatsby, knowing you may never read a better book. Fitzgerald exercises great economy with words--no sentence, no modifier, no preposition seems unnecessary; every one is deliberately chosen--and yet this clean prose isn't terse and uninteresting the way Hemingway's can be. Gatsby is a Great American Novel, a book about that vast subject, the American Dream, without being over-ambitious or expansive, or general.A few favorite things in Gatsby:The sequence where Nick first meets Tom Buchanan's mistress Myrtle and all travel to their hideaway in the city. Exercising great luxury and carelessness, the group gets drunk and underlying tensions foreshadow greater problems ahead, such as Myrtle's outburst and Tom's consequential fit of violence. This is a great look at the characters' profiles and what we are to expect of them.Fitzgerald's crafting of his narrator, Nick Carraway. Nick is a seemingly reliable narrator, an appealing confidante to his own friends, as he betrays in the first few pages of the novel, but he also reveals, unintentionally, that he has a rather towering opinion of himself. As the story moves along, it is up to the reader to take Nick's ultimate conclusion about the injustice of Gatsby's demise as the moral to extract from the tragedy.The conundrum of Gatsby himself. For one, his achievement is looked down upon by his peers of old wealth because he does not know restraint. His realization of wealth owes to breach of the law, and yet, he has worked to achieve what he has, as opposed to the more idle rich, people like Tom, Daisy, and Jordan. Fitzgerald casts an indelible pall on this American Dream of reaching the heights of a Tom, a Daisy, a Jordan because of the unmitigated decadence, the carelessness for others, still being looked down upon as ""new money"" in spite of one's toil, that in reality, such established people can always find ways to remove blemishes from their reputations, even if it means quashing someone in their way. Fitzgerald seems skeptical of the whole American Dream paradigm, a critique even Nick--who in the end finds himself admiring Gatsby's achievement--does not express. To him, such a prospect never existed. It's pessimistic but liberating at the same time: maybe there is more to life than owning the big house, the fancy car, and the trophy wife. "

586,Maciej Musialek,"What can I say? This book was one of the most poetically written books I have had a chance of reading in a long time. In a world where books are overloaded with sexuality, this piece of gem reminds me of what little things are sometimes observable in human behaviour that do in fact truly matter.In comparison to the movie the book follows the poetic narrative throughout and while you can't see the vibrant colours that the movie tried to convey the atmosphere is definitely there and there are a few interesting things that the movie authors shouldn't have omitted in my humble opinion. I would definitely recommend this book."
587,Sarika,"I have to say I was very surprised by this book. Everything about it was so unexpected; the length (I honestly thought it'd be around the length of the Count of Monte Cristo), plot, the point of view F. Scott Fitzgerald chose to tell this story from everything. I'm not really a big fan of the classics save a few and when I heard about this book I thought for sure I wouldn't like it. I originally started reading it because it was assigned for school but once i started I really couldn't put it down.Despite its length, this book successfully makes the reader feel every emotion known to man at some point or another with a tear jerking and unexpected (at least to me, who knew nothing about this book until about 4 months ago) ending.I definitely recommend this to everyone. Even peopel who don't like the classics, like me."
588,William Handel,"It would strike me as more than a little flippant to write a lengthy review on everyone’s favorite 9th grade book. I doubt I have anything original or useful to say. Just: I’m not sure why I never read this in school, I’m glad that I finally got around to it, and I enjoyed it for what I suspect are the standard reasons. The novel is certainly an exhibition of solid writing, overt symbolism, and appropriate societal critique. It seems especially relevant now, with the resurgence of the debate over the stickiness of income inequality and social status through the publication of books like Capital in the Twenty-First Century and The Son Also Rises. I thought chapters 1-8 were good, but not great. That final chapter though. Five stars. If for nothing else, for Gatsby and the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. "
589,Vladmir Souza,"There are several aspects of this book that cannot be taken for granted such as the comparison between the kinds of wealth (the one that comes with social status and can even make you get away with murder stark contrasts with the one, newly acquired, that leaves it’s owner vulnerable), but what really caught my attention was the power and touching image of the “great” Gatsby staring at the green light at Daisy’s dock across the Sound.At first I was surprised by the fact that Gatsby spent almost five years waiting for fate to bring his dream from across the Sound until he finally realized that he had to man up and go for what he wanted.Once Gatsby went the distance, and turned into a man of himself (ironically unlike Mr. Wilson), he could runaway with Daisy (which, for me, was the reason why he made his fortune). But it wasn’t that easy, he would have to make the decision of never again be able to “romp like the mind of god”. And for five years he postponed it. For five years he cherished his dream, spent whole nights staring at the green light across the Sound, being as close to her as the moon is to the stars.What I finally came to realize is that what held him back for so long wasn’t neither fear of being rejected nor all the problems he would have to face for getting involved with a married woman but in fact his love for his dream per se. He was intrinsically attached to the ideal he had created in his own mind.Although the fatalistic bottom line that Fitzgerald presents, what will always come to my mind when I remember this book it the power that dreams have. Especially the ability they have of taking us forward, in the direction of their fulfillment, while carrying us back ceaselessly into the past."
590,Crystal Beran,"Like so many people, I read this book for the first time when I was far too young to wrap my experience around it. It was the spring of my 16th year, when life was filled with school and sober parties at Mike's house. Everything was ahead of me and so there was no way to connect to the life of a man for whom so much was behind.There is a particular quality to turning 30, as I'm sure there is to each of the transitions in life; a quality which is incomprehensible to those who have not yet passed through it. I know what it is to stand on the edge of adult life, to see what I have accomplished thus far and to shake my head, knowing that wasn't what I meant to do at all.This is the crisis Gatsby faces as he struggles against the current of time. He can't go back but he knows he can't go forward from where he is. It is a crisis that I have the pleasure of being immersed in right now. I've been to the endless party and it wasn't what I'd hoped either.The Great Gatsby is a book best served to those above the age of 28. I remember enjoying it in high school, I truly do, but I remember, quite clearly, not getting it at all. This is a beautiful text, worthy of a re-read if the last time you visited it you were still in your teens.Oh, and I want to be kissed like this:""He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete."" -117"
591,Katrina,"I was so reluctant to read this book that I actually planned to skip the book club meeting at which they had planned to discuss it. But, it was available on Audible and Jake Gyllenhaal was the narrator. It was inexpensive so I decided to give it a try. I was, almost immediately, completely absorbed. The language was so rich and the story so engrossing. I thought Nick, the narrator, was a little self-serving, but he told a good story about some of the most selfish people I have met in literature. Tom and Daisy are beyond irritating with their selfish behavior and Gatsby is heartbreaking, his belief in love. This isn't the book that I had dreaded from high school. "
592,Yamini,"
This is a re-read for me as well as a second review of this novel.
At times, classics are always so talked about but never have proper synopsis so here’s a short idea of what Great Gatsby is all about. Nick, our narrator, presents the reader with the story in a second-POV of a rich and great man named Gatsby, who becomes Nick’s neighbor and friend. Gatsby throws lavish parties in his mansion and people from all over the city come to them, but barely anyone knows who Gatsby really is.The story revolves around Gatsby’s life and legacy. He asks of a favor from Nick, to invite his cousin Daisy to his house so that they could meet. Nick doesn’t realize at first the extent of which Gatsby has known Daisy before she married Tom, her rich husband with a mistress of his own. Nick narrates the life of Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, and his mistress through his view, the love, betrayal, seduction, and passion gripping the characters with misery and torment.This classic was first introduced to me in high school for my Honors British/American literature class so although this was a required school read, once I read this book it easily became one of my favorite classics of all time, above all the other classics among Pride and Prejudice, Frankenstein, or The Hobbit.The simplicity of the writing in this novel absolutely blows me away. Literally at times, I think. Reading this I think of it as just another book I’m reading but after I’m done, I just sit back and feel the rush of emotions from all the events that occurred in the book. Everything about Gatsby, from the moment we meet him, is tragic. His life, his hopes, his ambitions. He gives me the saddest feelings and although he’s isn’t the most ideal guy, he is still better than any of the other characters I met.As old flames blossom once more between Gatsby and Daisy, I always feel excited about how happier Gatsby comes across. It’s as if he really has turned the wheels back into the past and achieved what he always wanted. And every time I know what’s going to happen in the end, I still can’t help but feel that just maybe, maybe Daisy could’ve been changed if Gatsby had just had enough time. This doesn’t make her the ideal choice in my eyes, but it makes me sad how meaningless Gatsby and his life becomes by the end.It’s the typical tale of the rich and the poor that shall never meet. And the greatest fear a man can have, to live in a room full of people but feel like the loneliest sap on the face of the earth and even in your death, grieving over the emptiness that you feel in your soul. The saddest part is, this cycle continues on…"
593,Angelica Crane,"The Great Gatsby is one of those rare books that achieves far more than just being a good book inside the vast category of its intended genre. Technically a romantic story, it tells so much more than of the love between two people. It tells of a society in which the people are incredibly selfish and care about nothing but their own problems as well as a story about the love affair between two hopeful people, and it tells this story through the eyes of someone who has never belonged to this society and never will. It tells and reveals so much about the excess and the follies of American life in American history without being a book that reflects on American history. It has mystery to a certain degree, love, death, and many other themes of life. This book is more than it lets on at first glance and is one of the greatest books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. If you have never read it, I suggest picking up a copy at your local library and finding a comfortable seat because you will not put it down."
594,George,"I read ""The Great Gatsby"" years ago. I'm encouraged to read it again, because of the thoughtful description of what this novel's characters meant to the Iranian students that were taught by Azar Nafisi, as described in her memoir ""Reading Lolita in Tehran.""I STARTED READING ""Gatsby"" today May 17. I've read Chapter 1. It brings back good memories. When I'm finished, I plan to reread the section in ""Reading Lolita in Tehran"" that discusses ""Gatsby.""This is a great novel. It’s about the loss of a dream, Gatsby’s dream in particular. If empathy is at the heart of the novel, then this novel succeeded brilliantly for me. I felt great empathy for Gatsby, especially when Nick Carraway, the narrator, says of him that “He had come a long way … and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him … ” I wondered, when I read this, which of my dreams were already behind me. So, “[Gatsby:] teaches you to value your dreams but to be wary of them also.” [quote from Reading Lolita…:] Gatsby is a romantic and tragic dreamer. He comes back to Long Island to capture the heart of the woman who has come to represent his ideal. The irony is that Daisy, although charming and beautiful, is unworthy of the vision of perfection that he thinks her to be. She is shallow, insincere, hollow, empty, and careless. The destruction of his dream is what eventually leads to his death. Although, Gatsby’s dream is ruined by the unworthiness of its of its object, his power to transform his dreams into reality is what makes him “great.” I have a friend (Grant) who reads ""The Great Gatsby"" at least once every two years. After reading it for the second time, I can understand why."
595,Kevin,"Read this book in high school and neither possessed nor was presented with anything remotely resembling the contextual understanding and literary understanding to appreciate it. Only when I taught it in high school years later did I come to realize its greatness and deserved place as one of the top contenders as the Great American Novel.Such a carefully plotted and themed book, with all its oppositions of character, location, and motivation--such an insightful representation of the Jazz Age, and such a rich mine of descriptive gems. Not just the lyrical conclusion, the fantastic portrayal of Tom Buchanan getting depressed by a book or Meyer Wolfsheim fixing the World Series, but even Gatsby's car. Fitzgerald had no need to describe it so beautifully, other than sheer love of writing: ""I’d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hat-boxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of wind-shields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory, we started to town.""Makes me laugh in wistful admiration."
596,Rayan Fakhoury,Reading this again really shows the greatness of Fitzgerald. It will probably still be my favourite book even if I read it 70 times. 
597,Antosha Chekov,"Эта книга не столько о судьбах героев, сколько - о людских душах. История о мечтах. О порядочности. О нравственности. Драматический роман с очень сложными персонажами, о потерянных иллюзиях и одиночестве... Всю ценность этого произведения можно понять лишь дочитав до конца. Ненавязчивость повествования первой части событий - медленно, но верно, формирует образы героев, задействованных в романе. Фицджеральд настолько хорошо владеет пером, что читатель даже не подозревает, насколько искусно автор манипулирует настроением читателя, формируя представление о дальнейшем развитии романа и в то же время, дезориентируя его. Лёгкость, но красочность изложения прекрасно завуалирована колоритностью описания окружающего мира, как вымышленного, так и действительного. именно описание этого воссозданного в ""великом"" мозгу Джея Гетсби - является основной идеей романа. Человек, стремившийся побороть самый главный, на его взгляд, порок своей жизни, в результате выбрал себе уже не жизнь, а существование в мире прекрасных грёз и безграничных возможностей.Образ покинутого всеми человека, обличение самых пагубных сторон человеческого характера - прекрасно удались автору. Вескость доводов, приведённых писателем в конце романа утонули отнюдь не в ""смутных отголосках музыки и смехе из соседнего сада"", а в печальном перестуке дождя, завершивших оду о великом Гэтсби, человеке, свято верившем, что прошлое можно вернуть - стоит лишь дотянуться до зелёного огонька, ""света неимоверного будущего счастья""... В этом человеке было поистине нечто великолепное, какая-то повышенная чувствительность ко всем посулам жизни. Он обладал редкостным даром надежды, который его и погубил... Мне, очень понравилась эта цитата: ""...Только рухнувшая мечта ещё билась, оттягивая время, цепляясь за то, чего уже нельзя было удержать..."" По-моему, сильно.. трогательно..проникновенно.. прекрасно до дрожи.. до щемящей боли в сердце!"

599,Belle2," This book is a rare find. It's not often that I like a book, usually I feel there's not enough balance or it's too fast or slow. This was not perfect, but It was really great (hahaha). I think Fitzgerald really dodged a bullet and made his book amazing by making the main character not in the main relationship. It was a neighbor of Gatsby who seemed like a relate-able man. He wasn't wildly rich, had neutral position and made us relate to him the most. He was in a relationship with another woman, but it wasn't scandalous and didn't take too much focus from the real romance. Best part, their relationship, unlike Gatsby and Daisy's, is realistic. Also, the ending was pretty nice. SPOILERS A BIT I don't like to see happy endings all the time because they don't affect me as much. I prefer to have an ending that makes sense but would suck if it happened to me. This whole romance between Gatsby and Daisy will have a fallout, will have consequences. A good writer (like Fitzgerald) knows that consequences are the key to a good story line. A character can't simply get what they want with no repercussion, and it's how they deal with the consequences that make them who they are."
600,Rick,"I reread the Great Gatsby because my Kindle broke,for no good reason and I needed a book to read at the gym . With so many books I rarely reread anything but perhaps it makes more sense to go back to great stuff then churn through lesser works. The Great Gatsby is at the very top of list of favorite and great books. Last year I saw the Elevator Repair company's production of the novel in its entirety. The plot of the novel is deeply engrained in my memory but it nevertheless remains a great,timeless story. Reading it now one notices how impeccably plotted the novel is, Fitzgerald does not miss a beat. The major characters remain memorable. The set pieces in the book are miraculous. I was particularly struck by the terse elegance of the prose when Tom Buchanan breaks Myrtle's nose. Jordan Baker is a memorable and surprisingly modern character and the narration of Nick Caraway is the spine and brain of the novel.If you have never read this book you really should; if you read it before give it another look you will be glad you did."
601,Jane,"Believe it or not, the book came first, not the film ! I read The Great Gatsby a long, long time ago and loved it. Prompted by going to see the glorious Luhrmann version that’s showing everywhere, I’ve just re- read it. As so often is the case, the film doesn’t hold a candle to the book. It could never capture its breathtaking, almost poetic language. I had to keep stopping along the way to admire sentences ! Fitzgerald manages to weave a brilliant story around the shadowy Jay Gatsby. who says little of interest in the whole novel, but holds the best of parties. There’s something exotic and enigmatic about him. Why is he such a liar ? Where did he make his money ? Why, when he was complicit in such a terrible crime, do we forgive him ? Gatsby’s living a dream that all comes tumbling down and barely anyone attends his funeral. The fragility of it all is captured beautifully and economically. Second time round, I’ve appreciated the book even more."
602,Red,"I've reread this book I don't know how many times, and I still love it. One of my all time favorites. I feel like I notice something different every time I read it; it just gets better. I also feel like every time I read it, I like Nick a little less. The characters are just so real and complex that I tend to have mixed emotions about all of them the way I do with people in every day life. This book is incredible."
603,Joseph Flores,"I really liked this book. I really liked how the author portrayed the point of view of a man who lived in a really small house next to a giant mansion owned by a very nice rich man. I also liked the scene at the end when he died, the way the author described it made me reread it just to be in that moment multiple times. This book made me notice how arrogant rich people are and how giving and nice other rich people are. Such as the huge difference between Gatsby and Tom. The only thing I did not like about the book was the fact that Gatsby's Obsession with Daisy was an over attempt to impress a married woman, which was flattering to her but in the end, she didn't even show up to his funeral which was sad. Gatsby's death was her fault, he tried to take the blame assuming nothing would happen to him but he was wrong, he was being too nice. The story took place sometime in the twenties, the main character, Nick tried to get rich while working in the field of bonds. He moves to Long island across the lake from his cousin Daisy. He goes to visit her one day to see how they are. when he gets home that evening he sees his neighbor standing in the dark reaching for a green light at the edge of Daisy's mansion. Gatsby was a very wealthy man who went from rags to riches just to impress Daisy which actually worked for a while until she met Tom. Jay Gatsby only wants to become Nick's close friend in order to get closer to Daisy. The whole time Daisy has problems with her husband Tom and secretly loves Gatsby back, but she never leaves him because she enjoys being rich. She is unable to deny her love for Tom as well as Gatsby. In the middle on the way back from New York city with Gatsby, Tom, Daisy and Nick, Tom decides to switch cars with Gatsby. Daisy drives Gatsby's car. The whole time she was really stressed and she couldn't keep her eyes on the road, but when she came along into the valley of ashes she hit someone. It turned out to be Tom's friends wife, Myrtle who Tom was also secretly in love with- Nick knew this. When Jay found out he decided to take the blame for Daisy. Tom told Myrtles mourning husband who killed her and later in the story he gets his revenge by killing Gatsby when he didn't do anything, Jay never ends up getting what he truly wants (Daisy) and dies sad because she wouldn't leave Tom for him.Over all I think the movie was better, all seriousness aside I think any movie with DiCaprio in it is bound to be a hit. But the book went more into detail like every other book that had a movie. When I was reading this book I could barely put it down, it was that good, that's why I gave it a well deserved five out of five. There was so much detail put into such a small amount of pages that I couldn't not give it such a good score."
604,Meera Sachdeva,"I thought that the Great Gatsby was a great reading experience. I really like Fitzgerald's ideals of how the poor are always forced to struggle through life while the rich get it all easy as even nearly a century later, this idea still holds true. I also noticed how a lot of the time, the rich man's happiness was based on the poor man's downfall, as with Tom and Myrtle where we see Myrtle as the lady desperate to become part of Tom's world. This introduces the idea of the American Dream and how in reality it is fake and doesn't really work. This Dream bases it's ideals on the fact that anyone, form anywhere can find the opportunity for success in America, and we do we see how this works with Gatsby, in the way the he manages to go from a soldier to a man living in an obscenely luxurious house. However, this merely proves the fact that the dream does not exist as firstly Gatsby has gotten to where he is through crime and not through hard work or patience. Secondly, he is still not part of Daisy's class, he lives in West Egg not in East Egg in a rented and not owned house and even with all his efforts does not manage to capture the girl of his dreams. I especially liked how throughout the novel Fitzgerald constantly came back to this fact with his frequent references to the Gatsby's color yellow compared to Tom's gold."
605,Bruce,"I’d not read this novel for more than a decade, I think, but I just finished Tender is the Night and decided to read a bit more Fitzgerald. And how glad I am that I did. I’ve always enjoyed Gatsby, although I’d not in the past found it scintillating. But this time was different. First, I was more aware than ever of Fitzgerald’s droll use of humor. In this book filled with yearning, with the unbearable tension of desire, with the pull and often searing drama of human interaction, Fitzgerald is unafraid to deflate the characters and the rhythm of narrative with exquisitely delightful descriptions and comments that cannot but bring a smile to the reader’s face. Second, I was reminded afresh of Fitzgerald’s mastery of the wonders of language and description. Alas, a single example must suffice:“The quiet lights of the houses were humming out of the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees – he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder. “His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.”And finally, the deeper underlying issues of this text have become clearer to me over time. On the one hand, there are clear characteristics of realism here: exploration of the process of disillusionment, powerfully attractive to 20th century readers in our zeal for deflation, for the cutting off at the knees of any kind of hero, any figure who seems somehow bigger than life – witness, for example, the current populist political vindictiveness against any “elite”; the contrast that Fitzgerald explores between desire and possession, the clear message that wanting is more meaningful and satisfying than having, “having” always containing an element of disappointment, evanescence, or dissatisfaction; the concept and role of money as something inherently of little value, ultimately sought as a medium of fantasy or desire fulfillment; and the façade of riches as something covering a myriad of deeper values, or even an absence of any firm foundation of stable values. And perhaps most interesting to me is the awareness that language itself is the ""money"" of both our reality and our fantasy, the medium of our consciousness.One the other hand, Fitzgerald has clearly portrayed a fundamental democratic premise on which America was founded, the foundational myth of self-invention, of individual will-power as the critical ingredient for success, in essence the American Dream that has lured immigrants throughout the history of this nation. Even when the Dream comes up wonting time after time, it never ceases to appeal and entice, never fails to be the grail luring people onward. As a people we have an extraordinary gift for hope. The dreams that pull us forward have been born in and out of our pasts, and they never lose their power. As Fitzgerald concludes his moving and powerful narrative: “Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter – tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther…And one fine morning – “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”"
606,Deirdre Benavides,"This book has a certain charm to it that always pulls me as I read. The curiousness of the characters, their self-centeredness, the way their stories are each entwined through blood and romance and sex.I think the reason a lot of people don't particularly care for this story is because they are expecting a devout passionate romance, when it's really a rather odd and discouraging character balance. A painfully selfish woman loved by a deluded man who does not know himself very well, a puppy dog cousin eager to observe, a sharp husband. There are so many great lessons to be learned while observing the characters' interactions in this book - gossip, deceit, jealousy, loss, aloofness. Each character is distinctly flawed, some in more obvious ways than others, but it is interesting to pull them apart as you read.The scene in this novel that always strikes me is when Gatsby pleads (almost scathingly) with Daisy to tell Tom that she never loved him. I believe each of us have felt this jealous aching at some point or another in time. To long, so desperately, for someone to choose us over another. Her response, though painful, is what is often true. We build lives with everyone around us. Showing furthermore that even in decadence, there is emptiness, a resounding theme in this novel.I'm rambling now, but yes, I love this book."
607,Tracey Madeley,"Fitzgerald’s narrator is Nick Carraway who starts the book with a quote from his father to always remember that people have not had the same advantages as him and as a consequence he always reserves judgement when he meets people. Nick is from a wealthy family and went to school with Tom Buchanan, but he still feels like an outsider as he has to work for a living. He looks to go into the bond market and rents an inexpensive house in the grounds of Gatsby’s mansion.Tom and Daisy Buchanan are from a privileged class of bright young things. When we first meet Daisy she is lounging in a room with all the curtains open doing nothing. This fanciful idea of the curtain billowing, the ladies reclined with their skirts caught in the wind, as if being carried away in a balloon, fits perfectly with Daisy’s personality. “I’m paralyzed with happiness.” are the first words we hear her speak and reinforces the idea of doing nothing. Physically he gives the reader the description of, “Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it..” The excitement in her voice was “a singing compulsion, a whispered ‘Listen,’ a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since..” This flamboyant, effervescent character is both carefree and careless. The way she changes subject mid conversation to ‘you must see the baby’ suggests a lack of attention and a distressed mental state. She also suggests it is better for women to be a pretty fool, a social comment on the way women of her class are seen in Fitzgerald’s world.Tom equally indulges in the pleasures of life, not just his horse riding and cars, but keeping a mistress in the poor district between his mansion and the city. He suffers a crisis when Daisy admits to loving Gatsby and he finds out his mistress is being taken away by her husband. Suddenly everything he has is slipping through his fingers, he is losing control.Gatsby himself is a mystery. In the beginning we are told that no one is ever invited to Gatsby’s place they just turn up. This makes the invitation to the narrator equally strange. Then when Nick meets Gatsby he has to mysteriously disappear to answer a phone call. This is the first clue that Gatsby’s business is not strictly legitimate. He has made and maintains his fortune on prohibition. Yet everything he has and does is to impress Daisy, to be and belong in her world. He has a man in the city send him shirts, so he knows what to wear, the nouveau rich fitting in. The idea of him taking the blame for the car accident, when she was driving, is perfectly in keeping with his character.Why is he called great? I think Fitzgerald was creating the ultimate American icon. The self made man who never gives up no matter what. As one reviewer suggests, Fitzgerald is creating the American Dream before the term was even used. Gatsby also has this insatiable positive attitude which never gives up hope that there is something on the horizon, just out of reach, all you have to do is keep striving. Encapsulated in the famous closing lines, “Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter – tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further...” Again this pre-figures the American Dream that if you work hard enough you will succeed and those who fail, didn’t strive enough. It’s a recipe for tragedy, mental illness and loss."
608,Jayash,"The Great Gatsby starts with artistic profundity right on the first page! Before even getting introduced to Jay Gatsby, your mind will get engrossed with Nick Carraway's narrative fraught with sets of powerful philosophical ideas from the very inception. That ""reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope"" exemplifies one such self-reflective statement that fosters your interest to visit the world that Fitzgerald creates in this symbolic novel. And ""there are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired"" in this artificial world ""redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery"" characterized by young and superficial Daisy ""gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor"". A satire on the moral and spiritual barrenness of the modern U.S. lifestyle post World War I (which Fitzgerald refers to as ""delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War""), the novel is essentially an extra-ordinary love story with a veneer of the American dream.The moment you read ""I 'm Gatsby. I thought you knew, old sport. I'm afraid I'm not a very good host"" excites your mind because you've been waiting to meet Gatsby! After all, who is Gatsby? What's the story behind his aura of refined taste and respectability? Does he have any ulterior motives? The peculiar manner in which Fitzgerald presents Nick as a first-person ('I') narrator to build the character of Gatsby is one of the most striking features of the entire novel. And different states of emotions that Gatsby goes through, be it his unfamiliar look of embarrassment while shaking hands with Tom Buchanan in front of Nick or his unreasoning joy consumed with wonder at Daisy's presence, exhibit a complete picture of his heart in a ""constant, turbulent riot"". After all, ""no amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart"". Plus, the significance of social gatherings (be it parties, or even funerals) in highlighting the moral values and behavioral changes among the principal characters depicts the rapidly changing post-war American society: rampantly corrupt and inherently artificial. Don't give it another thought, old sport. It's a masterpiece I wish I read in high school. One of my all time favorites! Highly recommended!!"
609,Devin Vanderpool,"I read this classic in ninth grade for the first time, but was recently able to read it again due to an untimely sick day (as if those are ever timely). I understand why many of the classics are required reading for public schools in high school. But with some books, I feel like I missed a lot when I read them, this being one of those books. I had forgotten what lovely prose Fitzgerald used throughout this book. His descriptions are unlike any other writer, which is obviously what sets him apart. This is a story that is so relevant for our current culture. The American Dream can become the American Nightmare. So many people still chase dreams of wealth and fame and money, and Fitzgerald knew then that the pursuit of this would not bring happiness. Fitzgerald also deserves acclaim for this book for its original point of view. Not many writers have dared use a narrator in the first person that is not the protagonist of the story. For this particular story, it was the very best choice and I marvel at how he came to that conclusion for himself. This is a book I would advise everyone to read or reread. I put off watching the new The Great Gatsby movie until rereading, so I'm interested to see how it will line up with the story. Another great classic that deserves its acclaim."
610,Sedy .,Buenísimo. Genialoso. Simplemente awesome. Me ha encantado.
611,Quo,"I first read F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece for a course & remember dismissing it as just an odd sort of fable about some seemingly spoiled rich folks, with whom I had little or nothing in common. When I reread the novel many years later, I recall thinking that I had somehow stumbled upon a revised version of the book. Just how Fitzgerald had come to do an extreme revision posthumously seemed rather baffling because I reckoned that his novel had changed dramatically, while of course I had not. This is not the only time I have faced this sort of mysterious confrontation with a book I thought that I knew but it still seems the most stark, even after some years later reading the novel a 3rd time.  The Great Gatsby  is a novel about being & becoming, a story about a particular transformation, the sort that is perhaps common enough in any country but especially so in a land where many emigrated from countless distant points around the world to begin anew, to reinvent themselves & to achieve the stuff of dreams, things perceived to be unavailable in the place where they were born. Whether it is deemed a ""true classic"" may depend on your frame of reference but it is quite definitely a ""great American novel"" because it has long been said that in America it has mattered less where one is from than what one becomes after crossing the threshold at Ellis Island or a similar port of entry and this novel conveys at least some of that idea. Of course,  The Great Gatsby  is set during a particular time & place but just as James Gatz becomes Jay Gatsby, Ralph Lifshitz (via the Bronx & Baruch College) has more recently become Ralph Lauren & Martha Kostyra (by way of Jersey City & Barnard College) became Martha Stewart (via marriage), both being transformed into quintessential WASP-ish American icons. Curiously, Ralph Lauren contributed clothing design to the 1974 version of ""Gatsby"" with Robert Redford (son of a former milkman) standing in for the transfigured James Gatz. Yes, much of Gatsby's ethos involves the attainment of great wealth, the wondrous Long Island mansion & other gilded possessions but he was also guided by a more substantial, youthful ideal aimed at improving himself via guidelines that included: Rise from bed at 6:00; Exercise & wall-scaling 6:15-6:30 A.M.; Study electricity, etc. 7:15-8:15; Work 8:30-4:30 P.M.; Baseball & sports 4:30-5; Practice Elocution, poise & how to attain it 5:00-6:00; Study needed inventions 7:00-9:00 + some ""General Resolves"" not to waste time, not to smoke or chew, to be better to parents, to save money and to read one ""improving book or magazine"" per week. Such a commitment to personal progress was at the heart of Gatsby's character, even if his dream was ultimately corrupted and his fall from grace a hard one. For, ""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther...and one fine morning---"" At least for me, Fitzgerald's novel is a kind morality tale, if not a minor parable of sorts & Gatsby's obsessional love of Daisy Buchanan seems more than anything a case of Gatsby having fallen into a trance-like state, desiring to recreate a dream, rather than to actually bond with Daisy, ""the radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot out five years of unwavering devotion."" However you choose to view his dream or his demise, in the end Gatsby remains ""true"" to his dream & rather gallantly takes the fall for Daisy, whose flaws he can not even begin to envision, at least for me a kind of knight in tarnished armor, with no one but Nick Carraway to mourn him at the cemetery. "
612,David Kowalski,Just re-read this with new eyes after almost thirty years. Yep. It's as bad as it sounds. A remarkable piece of writing with as dark and beautiful a message as anything I've ever read. Time to go through the rest of Fitzgerald's work. I'll report back in another thirty...
613,Meagan Wilhoite,This is my favorite book I have ever read! It has been a favorite of mine since high school. Can't wait for the movie.
614,Emma,"The novel takes place in the summer of 1922 and is narrated by Nick Carraway who takes a job in New York. He rents a small house on Long Island, next door to the mansion of Jay Gatsby, a mysterious millionaire who holds extravagant parties. Across the bay lives his attractive second cousin Daisy with her rich husband Tom Buchanan, who was at Yale with Nick. It is revealed that Gatby is an ex lover of Daisy's and he throws the lavish parties in the hope that she will attend. The characters in this book are less than admirable, with the exception of Nick, who is honest, tolerant and inclined to reserve judgement. He acts as the middle man between the Buchanans and Gatsby. He constantly finds himself in awkward situations as the characters openly air their dirty little secrets amongst each other. Gatsby was my favourite character he had an aura of mystery about him and at the end of the book I still felt as though I didn't know much about him. I enjoyed reading about his friendship with Nick.Tom Buchanan was a vile man who openly has an extra marital affair with Myrtle Wilson, I detested his character. Daisy Buchanan I found to be shallow and insufferable.I really enjoyed this book it was packed with drama and was well paced. Although it is only 180 pages it took me longer to read it as it isn't written in 'modern language' [obviously] but nevertheless I still really enjoyed it.5 out of 5 stars."
615,Daria,"I muse wonderingly upon what I should rant on in this review. I technically finished said novel much too early - the rest of the class has probably forgotten its existence over mid-winter break - so I still have yet to be enlightened and make deep connections, analyze the importance of the so-called American Dream in this novel, etc etc etc. But putting its deep questions of human nature and society aside, I just want to say that this is some extraordinary writing. Exemplary, in fact. Meritorious. Superlative. Transcendent. Preeminent. The characters could live and die and love and hate a thousand times over, and I wouldn't care, so long as I can have Fitzgerald's metaphors and personification. But, no, I do not do the man justice; his story is captivating enough, his characters all too real - Daisy is marvelously detestable, while it is too easy to emphathize with Nick, it is too simple to patronize Tom Buchanan and Myrtle Wilson, and as for Gatsby... Well, I don't know what I think of this great Gatsby; on the whole, I guess I can agree with Nick. I dissaprove of him whilst being thoroughly enthralled by him, but I dislike the man, and yet have an unfounded affection for the hero. He is, quite simply, the one and only Gatsby; there will never be an individual quite like him in all of literature. Compared to the writing itself, the story is nothing special. You don't need to - you don't want to - look past Fitzgerald's language. Wow, just wow. (I may add on to this review later on, if something my English class comes up with will bolster further review-ability.) "
616,Cristina Lee,"Mi sento in empatia con te, Gatsby, adesso più che mai.Nella società di oggi poi, le tue feste e i volti familiari ma estranei sono uguale routine.Bello e straziante, un eroe, un sogno solo. Tutto il resto oscurato.L'amore, la disperazione, poi la rivincita, poi la caduta.Fantastica rilettura!"
617,Emmi,Wow! He (Zelda? He and Zelda?) can really write. 
618,Colona Public Library,"A short read, which doesn't make it any less of a master piece. A story set in 1920's. It's about a mysterious man, Gatsby, Who throws a parties every night that he never attends. His neighbor becomes good friends with and gets to know Gatsby. This book has amazing themes but the best has to be dissatisfaction, which is a driving force of why Gatsby was so successful among other things. I have read this book a few times and each time is has been though provoking to me. You can check out this book at the Colona Public Library. ~Ashley"
619,Pippin,"ENGLISH:This is one of my favourite american classics. Fitzgerald takes you to the twenties and gets you into a realistic New York scenario. If you're very fond of the Jazz Age, this is the book for you. Using Nick Carraway as the narrator, the author tells you a complex story about this mysterious man named Gatsby and the other characters who get involved in his life. As the pages go by, you'll find yourself inside of the Long Island mansions enjoying the extravagant parties and dancing Charleston.The plot is really intriguing and as you get to know each one of them, you'll realize that they're not what they seemed to be at the beginning, specially Jay Gatsby. So, I'd totally recommend reading this masterpiece.ESPAÑOL:Este es uno de mis clásicos americanos favoritos. Fitzgerald te lleva a los años veinte y te sumerge en un escenario real de Nueva York. Si sos aficionado de la era del Jazz, este es tu libro. Usando a Nick Carraway como narrador, el autor te cuenta una compleja historia sobre este misterioso hombre llamado Gatsby y los demás personajes que se involucran en su vida. A medida que las páginas pasan, te encontrarás dentro de las mansiones de Long Island disfrutando de las extravagantes fiestas y bailando Charleston.La trama es realmente intrigante y a medida que vas conociendo a cada uno de ellos te darás cuenta que no son eso que parecían ser al principio, especialmente Jay Gatsby.Así que, recomiendo absolutamente leer esta obra maestra."
620,Jenny Demonic,"""The Great Gatsby"" is a wild frolic through the memory of Nick Carraway and his meeting with Jay Gatsby over a summer. The writing is not epic, nor will it change the face of the world, but like Hemingway, Fitzgerald presents novels that don't require a degree in Russian literature to appreciate. The characters are selfish and flawed and utterly human. Daisy is worth pity, until you remember that the LAST guy who felt that way ended up dead. Tom Buchanan is a racist misogynist, Jordan Baker is an opportunist and a liar, and these are all people we have known in our own personal lives. ""The Great Gatsby"" is classic in that it is a simple novel full of humanity. "
621,Amanda,"I think it is a shame that I have only read this for the first time now and I am 23 years old. Almost everyone I know is shocked to hear that I have not read The Great Gatsby, each of them having read it in high school. With the new film now in theatres, I knew I had to read the book before I saw the film. Now I understand why people were so upset that I haven't read this yet.The Great Gatsby was a quick read (I finished it in about two days) and yet told a fascinating story. I loved seeing Jay Gatsby through the eyes of his neighbor--a young man who first knew nothing of Gatsby but slowly counted himself among his friends. Gatsby's love for Daisy was the driving force of the story for me. I admit (as I usually do in my reviews) that I am a hopeless romantic and the story of Gatsby and Daisy was so tragic. I loved the image in my mind of Gatsby standing on the grounds of his mansion and the only thing in the world that mattered to him was the green light across the water, blinking at the end of her pier. Everything he did, he did to move closer to her. He was desperate and in love. And those two emotions rarely mix well together.I thought that the story was written beautifully. F. Scott is a master storyteller and a true poet. I can see why The Great Gatsby is considered to be one of the greatest books to come out of the 20th Century and it is clear why it has lasted for almost 100 years, never losing an audience.Bravo, old sport."
622,Allison O'connor,"This ""old sport"" book will have you jamming to the music of 1922. I enjoyed reading a story that was based in 1922. The Great Gatsby is a story told by Nick Carraway. In this book Nick tells the story of Jay Gatsby. Gatsby was in love with Daisy. Sadly, Daisy had married another man. Gatsby was extremely rich. He had awesome parties every weekend. The way Gatsby's parties are described in the book are so breath taking. Gatsby made all his money and wanted to be successful just so he could get Daisy back. In the end, the reader gets a big surprise! I liked reading every single detail, including the party scene. There was only one part i didn't like. I didn't like when Myrtle got hit by a car and died. I hated the part when I found out that it was actually Daisy who was driving and Gatsby covered for her. I didn't like the ending. However, I would absolutely recommend this book. I would basically recommend it to everyone. I absolutely loved this ""old sport"" book."
623,Katya,"""Великий Гэтсби"" стал для меня визитной карточкой Ф.С. Фицджеральда. Очень рада, что начала свое знакомство с автором именно с этой книги!Язык романа подобен утреннему морозному узору на стекле – сверкающий, тонкий, изящный. Каждый элемент прекрасен и ни один не повторяется. Страшно нарушить такую красоту своим неосторожным дыханием. И ты стоишь, замерев от восторга, всматриваясь в хитросплетение узора, не стараясь постичь гений создателя, а просто наслаждаясь им.Замечательный роман, несмотря на то, что грустный и с печальным драматическим концом. Роман о человеке, который жил в роскоши, но не сошёл с ума от материальных ценностей, сохранил себя и остался человеком. Наши вечные ценности - любовь, дружба, верность...Не смотря на то, что в наш технический век мечтать о принце на белом коне может только последний романтик, сегодня, как и вчера, позавчера и даже поза-позавчера, мало кто задумывается о том, насколько счастливы принцы и принцессы, которых молва и папарацци причисляют к сливкам общества. Действительно ли обладание несметными богатствами, виллами, яхтами, дворцами и машинами может сделать человека счастливым?Золотая молодежь 20-х годов в Америке мало чем отличается от своих современных ""аналогов"". Обманутые надежды, разбитые сердца, супружеские измены, страсть, которая исходит на нет в считанные секунды... и искренняя, чистая, жертвенная любовь, пронесенная сквозь войну и то, что спустя полвека назовут ""периодом становления капитала"".Вечно одинокий Гэтсби. Дэзи и Том, которые, даже изменяя друг другу, не готовы рискнуть благополучием ради осуществления любовных планов. Ник и Джордан, страсть которых тухнет так же быстро, как и разгорается. А вокруг - поблескивающие яркими бусами и окутанные дымом сигар - пустышки. Люди, живущие без смысла, и без смысла уходящие из жизни. И на их фоне смерть Гэтсби выглядит еще более случайной и несправедливой.Очаровательное произведение, заставляющее лишний раз противопоставить вечные ценности материальным.Фицджеральд говорит: «Мой роман о том, как растрачиваются иллюзии, которые придают миру такую красочность, что, испытывая эту магию, человек становится безразличен к понятию об истинном и ложном».""Гэтсби верил в зеленый огонек, свет неимоверного будущего счастья, которое отодвигается с каждым годом. Пусть оно ускользнуло сегодня, не беда — завтра мы побежим еще быстрее, еще дальше станем протягивать руки... И в одно прекрасное утро...Так мы и пытаемся плыть вперед, борясь с течением, а оно все сносит и сносит наши суденышки обратно в прошлое."""
624,Bryana Grimsley," This novel was a wonderful piece of literature. It takes you into the world of the upper-class life in the 1920's. The characters in the story are one of a kind. They each represent something different. My absolute favorite part is when they describe Daisy's voice. I feel as if her voice is hiding her secret, but she wants you to know what it is. Nick, that narrator, is the glue of the whole group. He appears to be innocent and ends up experiencing a different way of life at such a fast pace. Gatsby,the main character, is such a diverse person. F. Scott Fitzgerald captured the essence of the 1920's. With how he describes the cars and how the towns are blostering and the jazz music that is swimming through the air.Each Character supports a different theme in the story. Tom and Daisy are both the epitome of adultery, while both Nick and Gatsby are the definition of dishonesty. They each play a role in the corruption of the upper-class during the 1920's. They represent the way wealth consumes the soul and makes you do tings you do not want to and shouldn't. Gatsby sought out money just to be with Daisy at the end, but ended up getting killed because of her. Wealth is corruption and corruption kills.The morality of society is constantly questioned through out the pages of this novel. The women were are so much more free in the story and just throwing themselves allover the place. Daisy for instance just goes off with Gatsby even though she is married, while Tom does the same with Myrtle. The fact that both Gatsby and Myrtle are both killed off is symbolism for the fact that dishonesty and the corruption must end. The infidelity within the story stops for all we know once they die. It is very significant that they end up dying being the fact that they are both the ones breaking up the Buchanan family.This is a wonderful book and largely recommend it if it you love a story that takes on a journey through a realistic situation."
625,Dean,"The Great Gatsby was an outstanding read, I recommend for readers who enjoy dissecting a text. This read was impressive in its ability to teach. In the novel during a conversation Gatsby has with Carraway, Nick asserts that we cannot repeat the past, this is when Gatsby assures him that one can. This was a matter of arrogance interfereing with true reality. The character Gatsby taught me to remember to be humble, where arrogance can easily lead us in the wrong direction. Gatsby's character taught me to not put all of your eggs in one basket. As Gatsby is madly in love with Daisy we see him act according to what would make her happy, what would bring him closer to her, and over all associate himself with her. After all is said and done, and even when Daisy professes her love for Gatsby, she chooses Tom. Finally I was truly inspired by Nick Carraway. During the unravelings and drama of the novel we see Carraway become quite close with Gatsby. After three months of knowing each other and spending time together they become outrageously close. I was inspired by Nick Carraway's passion and possible love for Gatsby as it transferred into a shortlived but wholehearted friendship. "
626,Stephen Kozeniewski,"The greatest novel in the English language, what else is there to say? (Well, pending my completion of Ulysses, but that isn't looking good, and sorry Moby Dick, but you're not even in the running.)"
627,سپیده جدیری,"It is a great book, like its name ""Great Gatsby"". I read it in persian language, translating from English by Karim Emami, late Iranian translator who was one of the best in his career. Great Gatsby is a beautiful love story influences everyone, I think."
628,Cynthia,"A perfect afternoon is to read The Great Gatsby aloud with students, then let the rhythms of Fitzgerald flow through me as I walk in the waves of Jericho, allowing the imagery of nature to culminate into writing my own novels. Being immersed in Fitzgerald's patterns of language inevitably unlocks the creative and passionate word play in all of us."
629,GaiaP,"No, non è al successo che punta Mr. Gatsby: per Fitzgerald e per il protagonista del suo romanzo, trovarsi sulla cresta dell’onda e cavalcarla, venendo ammirati da tutti, è solo l’inizio; dopo però, bisogna saper cadere. Bisogna fallire – e fallire alla grande. Con quale geniale tenacia Gatsby persegue la propria rovina, corteggia il disastro – come se solo in quella caduta libera e senza freni il destino potesse trovare il suo sublime compimento, sprigionando una luce e una vita che né la gloria né tutta la ricchezza del mondo potrebbero mai contenere. Gatsby crolla – e con lui naufraga tutto il romanzo, anche se gli altri personaggi finiscono bene o male per farla franca; s’inabissa in una sbornia tanto più abbruttente e devastante quanto più è vissuta da sobrio. E’ una tragedia, la sua – ed è una tragedia l’American dream preso in blocco, si direbbe – ma noi la guardiamo attraverso il vetro smerigliato che ci para davanti un narratore che, sin dalla prima pagina, solennemente dichiara che sospenderà il giudizio sulla vicenda che sta per raccontarci. Non c’è una morale, quindi, ad onta della sottile tensione etica che avvolge l’intera storia; e così, chiudiamo questo agile (e pregnantissimo) libello chiedendoci se il protagonista sia un santo sognatore, un poeta, un visionario, oppure un farabutto della peggior specie, un bugiardo patentato, un criminale… E sì, probabilmente è entrambe le cose ed il tocco lievissimo di Fitzgerald lascia il suo eroe/anti-eroe lì, in bilico fra forze opposte, indeciso fra la più assoluta e mediocre banalità e le altitudini del sublime...https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get...

630,Foroogh,"مدت ها بود که کتابی در این اندازه دلنشین و مجذوب کننده نخونده بودم. هر جمله آنقدر زیبا نوشته شده که ارزش چندبار خوندن و در ذهن مرور کردن رو داره، به همین سبب فارغ از داستان من از خوندن تمام فصول کتاب کمال لذت رو بردم. بالاخره وقتی کتابی لقب ""دومین رمان بزرگ قرن بیستم"" رو یدک می کشه باید هم جادویی و مسحور کننده باشه."
631,La Mala  ✌ ,"Es imposible para mi leer este libro sin evocar ese sentimiento tanguero de la nostalgia y la inocencia perdida. Del amor herido y los ""sueños de juventud"". Y tanto Gatsby como Daisy están atravesados por ese amor a la ensoñación y a la idealización del pasado perdido. El libro entero parece salido de las voces del tango, de: ""Si la hubiera llegado a entenderya tendría en mi rancho el amor!Yo la vi florecer, pero un día,¡mandinga la huella que me la llevó!Flor de Lino se fuey el hoy que el campo está en flor¡ah malhaya! me falta su amor.""Y: ""Promesas vanas de un amorque se escaparon con el viento.Después...¿qué importa el después?Toda mi vida es el ayerque me detiene en el pasado,eterna y vieja juventudque me ha dejado acobardadocomo un pájaro sin luz.""Y también: ""Y ahora que estoy frente a tiparecemos, ya ves, dos extraños...Lección que por fin aprendí:¡cómo cambian las cosas los años!Angustia de saber muertas yala ilusión y la fe...Perdón si me ves lagrimear...¡Los recuerdos me han hecho mal!No hay que malinterpretar a este libro pensándolo como una historia de amor en realidad. Creo que habla mas de una sociedad en decadencia y, en medio de eso, un antihéroe que trata de buscar algo a que aferrarse entre tanta desilusión. Sin embargo, como no se puede hablar de Gatsby sin hablar de Daisy, a veces me suena un poco vano el odio general contra un personaje que no hace mas que pasar por todas las decepciones que el mismísimo antihéroe: un matrimonio fallido con un hombre infiel, una vida aburrida y un hombre olvidado en el tiempo que siente cosas por ella que ella nunca sintió por el; y en el medio, la enorme decepción de conocer que la vida no es mas que vida.  En fin, casi un bovarismo lo de Fitzgeald, no les parece? "
632,XAИИA,"I'm currently writing an essay on the destructive nature of desire across prose, poetry and drama and this was the text my teacher told was a must I should use. The book is one of the greatest love stories there is, but Fitzgerald I have found never intended it to be that way. He wrote a story of destruction which it very much is too. The story is told by Nick who lives in a small cottage type setting in the grounds of Gatsbys manor and the story follows Gatsby and his desire to be reunited with Daisy, who in the meantime has married Tom. The relationships are complex despite the story being quite simple. The book it's self is very well written and my only upset is how short it is, easily read in one sitting if you had a few hours. Well worth a read and upset that I have read this book before!"
633,Beatrice Drury,"In an attempt to decide what I would write in a review I read a number of Goodreads reviews. I was amused by many of the comments. So many were obsessed by Nick's apparent homosexuality. Many were complaining about having to read this in high school. I didn't have to read it in school. I have never seen any of the various movies. I went in to this completely fresh. I read it because it is listed on almost every best of book lists.I firmly believe that Nick's sexuality has no bearing on the story. He held a fascination for Gatsby I think because in many ways he envied his ability to rise above his past. Nick was less rich than those he was around and was in many ways on the outskirts of the lives around him. Lucky for him. They were a completely vacuous bunch, cared for no one but themselves and despite their wealth not worth a penny.It is really a sad little novel. No one really wins, except maybe Nick when he moves back to the Midwest. If this is what the Roaring 20's was like I'm glad I am too young to have experienced it. I do suspect that there will always be people like this though. I can think of a few in the news now."
634,Kimchi,"I have to say this is one of the few ""classic literary masterpieces"" that I actually adore.Fitzgerald's writing is intricate and vivid and the whole idea and sentiment behind the story is such a fantastic comment on the vapidity of a certain era of upper-class society or even further just a vapid kind of people in general. When I first got an idea of what the Great Gatsby was about, I was extremely uninterested as I thought it was just going to be about whiny, shallow, rich people. But Fitzgerald takes it above and beyond that and as a whole aptly communicates his distaste of that kind of vapid culture of people. I think this quote from the book helps sum it up:""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy - they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made...I shook hands with him, it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child.""Some other quotes straight from the book that I really like:""Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,"" he told me, ""just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had"". ""I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life."" ""Thirty - the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning briefcase of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside me, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age.""I just really love this book, it's such wonderful prose. "
635,Anne Robinson," In the height of the time of the American Dream, the mysterious Jay Gatsby lives extravagantly but only truly desires the heart of Miss Daisy Buchanan.  There is something so romantic about the idea of Gatsby, with his extravagant parties, endless connections, and private personal life. This book perfectly encapsulates the times of the Roaring Twenties and the American Dream, including the shortcomings of the dream itself. Definitely my favorite book of that era, I first read the Great Gatsby in 10th grade for enjoyment, and had the opportunity to reread it in Honors English for a deeper analysis. I loved how the almost unnoticeable motifs perfectly support the themes of the novel, and how fulfilled I felt once I was able to see all of the layers to the classic story."
636,Ariel,"I find it fascinated how I can simultaneously not really like any of the characters and still love the book and story. You get to understand them and why they do what they do. That along with the beautiful writing and description of the world made me fall in love with it. Even though I didn't really like the characters, some how I cared for them and that made the story even more heart breaking in the best way possible!"
637,Barbara MrsTeapot B,"Solo questa storia poteva essere scritta per Jay Gatsby, e l'ho amata.http://mrs-teapot.blogspot.it/2013/04..."
638,Abbey,"Fitzgerald is one of my go-to authors whenever I need a quiet space for myself. I love being transported back into his 1920s wonderland of debutantes and big houses, money troubles and moral ambiguities. Everybody pretty much knows the plot (such as it is) of Gatsby - pared down to essentials: ""poor boy loves, then loses rich girl; poor boy becomes rich; now-rich boy worships rich girl but things get messy"". The movie was splendid, gorgeous to look at albeit slow-moving, and some of the acting was splendid - I'm of two minds about Mia Farrow's performance, sometimes I think she intends being that vapid and null (it would fit the character), and other times I think she was only stoned... Sam Waterston gives a great performance, Robert Redford seems to mainly be eye candy, and the supporting performances are first-rate. One of my all-time favorite stories, whether in print, on screen, or in audio. Update 2013: haven't seen new movie yet but looks gorgeous; remains to be seen what they've done with plot though..."
639,India Stoker,"Acabo de terminar esta magnífica novela, me ha parecido maravillosa y preveo que me esperan varios días de resaca literaria, por que a ver que leo yo después de ésto? Cualquier cosa que coja no le va a llegar ni a la suela de la zapatilla."
640,Alberto,"""...Tuvo que sentir que había perdido el calor de su antiguo mundo, y que había pagado un precio muy alto por vivir demasiado tiempo con un único sueño [...] Debió de ver un mundo nuevo, un mundo material, aunque no real, donde fantasma desdichados, que respiraban sueños en lugar de aire, iban sin rumbo de aquí para allá...""Es de esas historias, que una vez que comienzas a leerlas, a vivirlas, puedes seguir y seguir, y seguir, y seguir, y seguir..."
641,Thenewblue,"My favourite book of all time so far, an absolute work of art.Many people say to me that they don't like Fitzgerald as a writer - to this I almost always say ""You don't have to like his novels to know he is a true genius."" and The Great Gatsby proves it.The entire book has an almost synaesthetic quality about it - particularly in the descriptions of the people and the parties. Fitzgerald describes characters so well, including their effect on the general atmosphere, their smallest mannerisms, their reactions, their personalities, their upbringing and so on SO WELL that they could almost be in the room with you - you can feel their presence there as you read through the story. The imagery is second to none, and you truly feel each word as it is read. The plot, although seemingly mundane and generic on paper, could not be further away from that. The littler twists and turns, suspense, will-they won't-they moments and the progression of the characters relationships are wonderful to read and keep the audience gripped throughout.Some people argue that the ending of the book was obvious right from the very beginning - and although I agree in part, I will have to say that I honestly do not think it matters. Somehow nothing is taken away from the dramatic ending, and it still stuns the reader.The subtle way in which Fitzgerald writes is fantastic - he describes the smallest insignificant details forever, but when it comes to the main, plot-twisting events in the story, the reader almost misses them. The impact this gives is amazing - that first thought of ""... Wait, what?"", followed by (after a short reread of the paragraph) that second wave of shock is something I have not experienced in any other book - Fitzgerald almost makes the reader work for the plot.My only small criticism is the way in which Fitzgerald writes with almost no emotion, although this is down to personal opinion and style of the author, it is in no way a criticism of the book. I just feel that maybe the aftermath of a lot of the events would have been more poignant had Fitzgerald put a little bit of emotion into his narration. However, perhaps that was the clinical effect that Fitzgerald wished to have, as it shows that Nick is a true bystander - never getting involved either physically, mentally or emotionally - and the perfect narrator for the book.Five stars, and I will never give it anything less."
642,Ryland Dinneen,"Wow...just...wow.The Great Gatsby is one of those books that you are always told to read - it's literally everywhere. You know it's considered to be ingenious and you know it's a modern classic and you know it's worshipped by literature fans everywhere and you know you know you know you know, but for some strange reason you never actually get to reading it. There is that little fear that it will bore you to tears, that you'll start it and never finish it - that little fear inside everyone that the book will focus so much on the point it tries to make that it will simply lack any emotional attachment and couldn't draw you in if you nailed your head to it's pages. Rest your heads, because The Great Gatsby is the opposite of this.Immediately, we are introduced to the character of Nick Carraway (who narrates the story). We grow an immediate connection to him, for me due to the fact that he seems to be an outsider in the society he lives in. He buys a house of medium sizes right next to towering mansions, and from the get-go we can relate to him (that is unless you bathe in money and couldn't understand what living a normal life is if it slapped you in the face and tore out your testicles). But, surprisingly, he isn't hugely important to our tale. He is simply a visitor - an observer to the life of his neighbour, Jay Gatsby, who obviously rolls around in $100 bills for shits and giggles.After the introduction to Carraway, we meet Daisy & Tom Buchanan. They live a yippitee-dandy lifestyle in which (spoiler alert) Daisy is only married to Tom because he is one rich son of a bitch. And worse yet, Tom enjoys hanging out with his mistresses and verbally abusing Daisy (some may argue otherwise). If not verbal abuse, than he treats her like garbage. As a person who is not able to analyze literature very deeply, it is obvious we are given our first treatment of the American Dream present in this oh-so-joyous society that is 1920's Manhattan. Money > emotion. That took a lot of thought, didn't it?And soon after (don't piss yourself in joy), we meet Jay Gatsby. Gatsby just so happens to love Daisy, and as we find out, the only reason he lives where he does is so that he could be closer to her, even though their love is forbidden due to her admittedly unhappy marriage, though she protests otherwise. Daisy is dishonest to both Gatsby and Tom, telling Gatsby she never loved Tom (which is debunked in an angry conversation later on) yet never revealing to Tom that she has any feelings towards Gatsby. I could say that Daisy didn't love Gatsby, and that she used him for her own entertainment, but I will allow you to interpret that for yourself. And so we have these complicated issues that surround us in the book's short runtime. Remember when I talked about money being more important than everything, more or less emotions? Well, I can say that my favourite part of the book only revolves around one short phone call that for me translates the novel's message in a very effective manner. (Another spoiler alert ahead).The day after Gatsby dies (read up on how, I won't explain it all), Nick Carraway plans the funeral and has all of Gatsby's close friends informed of the date, to which most promise to attend. Every body is giving their condolences, and all are genuinely sad. Yet one of Gatsby's close friends calls Nick later that day, and Nick asks if he is attending the funeral (assuming the funeral is the reason for the phone call). This friend says unfortunately he can't because he has a tea party to attend with important people (which sets Nick Carraway on edge immediately). And after an irritated conversation between the two, the friend casually informs Carraway that the reason he called was because he left a pair of shoes at Gatsby's house and would like to know if Gatsby knows where they might be, as they are very important. Nick hangs up immediately. Maybe it sounds not so bad as I describe it, but I can assure you it really does punch you in the face with meaning when it does come. The point is, The Great Gatsby is an important book with important messages that should be studied and understood, but it is also complex and emotional, a book that is both enjoyable and thoughtful. I would strongly recommend this book to anybody and everybody."
643,Seeley James,"This book, though dated, was a great book for writers. The concept and story are not earth shattering, what makes it a classic is the writing. He breaks some rules, bends others, and defines most. Being male, I'm not qualified to comment on the romantic ideals, but the dialogue and the descriptive passages set the 20th Century standard. Check my blog post where I deconstruct some of Fitzgerald's methods.Peace,  Seeley "
644,Rachel VB,"If you have not yet read the Great Gatsby, I can tell you many a reason why you should pick it up as soon as a slot in your schedule will allow:1) Great Gatsby is set in post-war, pre-Depression 1920s East Coast America. Picture the era of decadent parties...and the fashion and attitudes of the time. 2)The American dream of prosperity. Or rather, the universal dream. Aspirations of the time are after all not exclusive to folks in the 1920s and nor to Americans alone. You will relate.3) The drama that ensues. Decadent parties, very extravagantly wealthy people, questions as to how they go wealthy in the first place, intrigue, love triangles, jealousy, lovers reacquainted after 5 years. Oh yes. Drama does ensue, and yes, you will be hooked.4) It is not overly time consuming. At just over a 100 pages, it's no big feat. 5) You will not be left out of pocket getting your hands on a copy. At just over 2 euros on the Book Depository and at your door in a couple of days (I ordered it on a Tuesday and received it on the following Friday!)you'll be digging into i in no time.6 To read it before the film this December. Need I even link to the awesome bomb of a trailer?Dig in."
645,angela,"I missed out on reading a lot of classics when I was in high school. For some this was required reading, but not at my school. I feel I have to admit, the first thing I ever knew about this story was due to Baz Luhrmann's movie Gatsby. I know books are always seen as better than the movie and I heard the same thing about this book after I was raving about the movie to friends. So I read the book as an adult, after having seen- and loved- the movie. I have to say, I loved the book! And I thought the movie did a great job at sticking to the story. I can't deny that I was picturing Luhrmann's vision while reading, as that had been my first impression. Anyway, it was a very short read and the prose were beautiful. I think this is one case in which the movie stands up to the book. It certainly has Luhrmann's trademark style (modern music, fast pace) but I also like that. "
646,Brandon Colligan," ""The Great Gatsby"" by F Scott. Fitzgerald is a story of life and love during a time of a thriving American culture. The main characters find themselves in a lustful and unforgiving society that eventually leads to the heartbreak and misfortune of others. The plot revolves around a love story between Gatsby and Daisy in which Daisy is already married.  The character and narrator of the story, is a man named Nick who comes to New York in the rush of the stock exchange in the 1920's. He lives in a small cottage next to the ginormous mansion of Jay Gatsby who throws luxurious parties just to lour his love Daisy to them. Daisy lives directly a crossed the harbor from Gatsby but is married to a man named Tom. Tom is a wealthy man who inherited it by plantations and slave trade which is also known as ""Old Money"". The time period takes place in the 1920's, which Fitzgerald describes as the ""Most Costly Orgy of All Time"". It shows of how the American culture has changed and has a new sort of greed and technological advances. As the story progress', it shows the evils hidden in the beauty of this time.  Fitzgerald's theme is to show the audience how greed and selfishness during this time destroyed good people, such as Gatsby in the story. F. Scott Fitzgerald writes with passion when describing the scene of goods and bad of the times. This time period had an obvious impact on him as he was only in his twenties at the time. He also seems to have a sense of hopeless romanticism.  I would recommend this book to a mature audience. The story can become complex and must be interpreted to get the entire detail of the story. There are also many details that help construct the love story that makes up the most of the story. "

648,Jazmin Quinonez,"“Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages you’ve had.” These words of the narrator’s father introduce us into the story that is The Great Gatsby. Written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, this book is a novel. The story is set in the summer of 1922, and the fictional town named West Egg on Long Island. The main focus is on Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan. The 10 main characters of the book consists of Nick Carraway, Jay Gatsby, Daisy Buchanan, Tom Buchanan, Myrtle Wilson, Jordan Baker, Meyer Wolfsheim, George B Wilson and Mr. Gatz. Nick Carraway is the narrator and also Daisy’s cousin. Daisy and Gatsby fell in love in Louisville when they were very young and all the military men were said to be in love with Daisy. Gatsby left to the war and Daisy decided to marry Tom Buchanan who is Nick’s best friend since their college days. A day before her marriage, Gatsby sent his love at home a letter and she drank herself to numbness. Nevertheless, she married Tom the next day. Tom has cheated on Daisy throughout their marriage and has a mistress living in New York named Myrtle Wilson. Him and her are both in married relationships and are unhappy but have done nothing about it to change that besides be unfaithful to their partners. Meyer Wolfsheim is the man who fixed the 1919 World Series. Jordan Baker is a well respected famous female tennis player. Nick feels he is in love with her. Gatsby says he moved to West Egg so he can be closer to the love of his life, Daisy Buchanan. He tells Jordan about the love he has for Daisy who soon tells Nick during a date. Gatsby wanted for Nick to set up a meeting and have tea with Daisy to reunite. He didn’t do it himself because he was afraid he may be rejected by Daisy. When they finally meet up, it seems to be awkward at first until Nick leaves them two be for a while, when he returns it seems as though they never lost contact all those years. A tragedy of events happens very quickly in the story. One day Jordan, Tom and Nick were driving when they soon find out that Tom’s mistress, Myrtle Wilson has been killed by Gatsby’s car. Gatsby took all the fault, although Daisy was the one driving the car. Tom tells George B. Wilson, Myrtle’s husband, who hit Myrtle and was the cause of her death. George shoots Gatsby while he was enjoying himself in his pool and kills himself after. 	I believe the intended audience for The Great Gatsby is for all the people who are interested in romance novels of the earlier times during the 20th century. This book took a drastic turn in events very fast and resulted in a couple of deaths. Too many for my liking. The Great Gatsby is a well written book with sad but interesting events and a great story line, I enjoyed this novel!"
649,Anders Frisk,"The Great Gatsby is an entertaining read and a good indication of the mood of America in the 20s. Nick is a sensible character trying to find his way in lif but there are some serious flaws/issues with Tom, Jordan, Daisy and even Gatsby himself. It is a story that touches on one of life’s lessons, peoples strong wish to grasp an opportunity that may have passed them that in hindsight could have turned out differently. Poor Gatsby has a plan in his head in how his life would become perfect if he could rewind time and kick start his relationship with Daisy. The book is full of wonderful examples and individual scenes that have stood the test of time. It delivers a strong dash of reality to Gatsby. The Great Gatsby ends up not being particularly great for any of the main characters."
650,Amy Rae,"True fact: I'd never read The Great Gatsby before I decided to tackle it as the first book in my private Bowie book club. (Having discovered that I had read only 0.5 of David Bowie's 100 favourite books, I, like numerous others, decided to start reading through his list.) My high school's language arts department was incredibly hit-or-miss, and unfortunately, I got a lot of the misses. We watched works of great literature rather than reading them on numerous occasions--among others, A Tale of Two Cities, Ethan Frome, Wuthering Heights, and you guessed it, The Great Gatsby. And in the case of The Great Gatsby, I slept through the first class period in which we watched it, then skipped the next two, because I wasn't exactly the world's most responsible student in eleventh grade. (No thanks to some of my more lackluster English teachers, I might add.)Which is to say that reading Gatsby at twenty-eight was a long-overdue experience, one I thoroughly enjoyed. It's a bleak, melancholy book in many ways, and Fitzgerald is interested in many of the same sorts of unnamable sorrows as I am; I found myself saying ""I know exactly what he means"" repeatedly. Sometimes what he (and I) meant was cloaked in metaphor, because that's the only way to get it across.But being the latest person to read this book probably doesn't make for a particularly interesting review--it's making it hard to write, to be honest, because surely everyone's already said everything I possibly could. So I'll just say that I can see why Bowie might have loved this one. The characters are well-drawn, with a sly eye towards satire in places, and the excesses Fitzgerald describes line up well with those Bowie alternately luxuriated in and decried through his artistic career. And I think the only reason Bowie never described ""yellow cocktail music"" in his songs is because Fitzgerald got there first."
651,"Read, Run, Ramble","I read The Great Gatsby for the first time while I was in high school. I remember enjoying the book, but that is about all I remember. As I read through it this time, I was amazed that I didn't remember more of the story - there are some really big events and surprises in this story!Fitzgerald is one amazing writer - I enjoyed the scenery he produced. Readers will feel immersed into the partying lifestyle Fitzgerald created. I found myself visualizing in great clarity the dress, the hairstyles, the colors, the speech, the shenanigans...everything in this book comes alive.Gatsby begins as an enigma and while readers get lots of details and answers about his life, he remains some what enigmatic. Other characters are a little more transparent as well as less likable. Nick, the story's narrator, tells his own story as well as Gatsby's in a clear voice. I liked Nick - he was affluent yet real and not snobby or ""holier than thou"". Readers will watch as Nick transforms from a curious neighbor to a loyal, devoted friend.For a classic, The Great Gatsby is surprisingly easy to read with a good flow and a mysterious, intriguing story line."
652,Cassidy Lowe,"""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.""What a great way to close a story that might leave one wanting more details. On the other hand, there are just enough details to keep the story flowing, mystery building, and romance budding. Sometimes less really IS more.Jay Gatsby is such an intriguing man one can't help but fall in love with him yet be completely skeptical and on guard of his true motives. Daisy is named after a delicate flower which suits her character's personality. Frail and pretty, able to compliment others in the bouquet without being very interesting standing alone. In the end she did not deserve the Gatsby's undying affection and devotion. i may be being too hard on her considering he started the relationship off on false premise. Then we have Tom. A man's man who is off living his own adulterous life while he thinks his devoted wife is waiting around on him to come home and entertain her. The story is told from Nick Caraway's perspective as he gets drawn into the triangle of the three. This is brilliant because this means his is the unbiased opinion.What a wonderful book. I can fully appreciate it being on so many ""top ten classics"" book lists. The characters are developed nicely; there are elements of romance, mystery, and suspense. I did not want to stop reading it and I did not want it to end! This is a book that I can see myself reading again in my lifetime as it is very short and I am sure I would pick up new perspective with each new reading. I highly recommend to anyone who hasn't read this to do so immediately. "
653,Frank Sanello,"A major classic and a major tragedy...The Fitzgerald CurseMost literary scholars agree that ""The Great Gatsby"" is THE greatest American novel of the 20th century, but there's a tragic footnote to the novel's enduring acclaim.The critical and commercial success of ""The Great Gatsby"" haunted its author. F. Scott Fitzgerald, who spent the rest of his life trying to duplicate his early achievement. His failure to do so may account for the famous quote attributed to the novelist: ""There are no second acts in American life.""Ironically, Fitzgerald did enjoy a successful ""second act,"" but he either didn't realize it, or financial considerations made him feel like a failure. The minority opinion of scholars is that Fitzgerald's later novel, ""Tender is the Night,"" is superior to ""The Great Gatsby,"" but Fitzgerald didn't accept that verdict because unlike his earlier classic, ""Tender is the Night"" was not a commercial or critical success.That's one of the reasons Fitzgerald destroyed his health and self-respect by moving to Hollywood, where he became a well-paid but unsatisfied screenwriter. Other great writers who needed money also relocated to Hollywood, but they took the studios' money and ran...back home where they could write for themselves, not write vehicles for stars like Joan Crawford. (There's an apocryphal quote attributed to Fitzgerald, who wrote a screenplay for a film that starred Crawford. Fitzgerald said, ""Never write a stage direction like 'pretend you're telling a lie' because Joan Crawford will act like Benedict Arnold selling West Point to the British."" Love that quote.)Unlike his cynical peers, Fitzgerald took his second career as a screenwriter seriously and wasted his enormous talent trying to write The Great American Screenplay. He failed, and his sense of failure undoubtedly exacerbated his alcoholism, which caused his premature death from a heart attack. To be fair, it should be noted that he died sober, working on his unfinished novel, ""The Last Tycoon,"" which some critics believe would have become his masterpiece, surpassing ""The Great Gatsby,"" had the author lived to finish the novel, a roman a clef about MGM's production chief, Irving Thalberg, the title's last tycoon.When Orson Welles died, many obituaries quoted Fitzgerald's claim about no second acts in America because Welles, like Fitzgerald, never duplicated the quality of his first film, ""Citizen Kane."" Also like Fitzgerald, Welles spent the rest of his life and career pursuing the second act that eluded Fitzgerald as well.After Fitzgerald's death, one of his closest friends, Dorothy Parker, allegedly mumbled during the burial service, ""Poor son of a b****."" Parker's comment would have made an appropriate inscription on his tomb stone.And now, if I may indulge in a bit of shameless self-promotion, the books I've written are posted on Goodreads.com at http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/....Frank SanelloFSanello@aol.com"
654,Ben,"Is the Great Gatsby about the emptiness of a social scene where everybody talks, but nobody listens? Is it about Gatsby's love for a Daisy Bucahanan that no longer lives, but exists only in his memory? Is it about the Roarin' 20's, about the upper class, about the lives of war veterans? Is it about moving East, about growing up, about choosing new family better than the one fate handed you?The great thing about the Great Gatsby is that it's about all of these things, but Fitzgerald only speaks on each in moderation. It is quintessentially American to be a little bit of this and a little bit of that, mixed all together into something new and different. It's a testament to Fitzgerald's skill that he adroitly addresses all these topics without overstaying his welcome on any.I'm only a moderate fan of Fitzgerald's writing style, but I'm a huge fan of his exploration of the human (and American) condition. Admittedly, I may be biased: I've wanted to redefine my James Gatz self into a Jay Gatsby type, I've suffered through infatuation with women greater in my mind than in reality, and I've found myself -- so many times -- alone in a crowd.The Great Gatsby is a worthy bookshelf keeper precisely because it is so fundamentally American that it's worth cracking again and again."
655,Scott Taylor,"After somehow skipping out on reading this during high school, I finally got around to it. The plot is a bit thin, but the prose is surprisingly wonderful. Fitzgerald's writing surpasses with aplomb what would otherwise be a very mundane novel through lovely turns of phrase and descriptive passages.Otherwise, the plot and characters are a bit mired in sleaze. We don't see any heroes here. Just people living the good life until it comes crashing down on them. I suppose this could be a negative commentary on being wealthy or the pursuit of the American Dream. But the human frailty present in the characters could be present in both the richest person in the world and the poorest, in equal measure. All it takes to bake that particular cake is a healthy overdose of self-interest.But its not so much the characters or the plot or the commentary that gives Gatsby its staying power. It is the amalgam of all of these aspects, the directness of ideas, the use of language, and the boldness of the author in being razor-focused on what he wanted to do and say here through his narrator, Nick. Nick is the guy above it all, who sees all that transpires without getting pulled into it. He is the gateway into this world for you, the reader. Its a narrative ""trick"" perhaps, but it works.Reading ""The Great Gatsby"" was like spending an afternoon splashing around in a shallow lake that has occasional deep spots that tickle your toes with cool profundity. And I will do that any day of the week, anytime.Thanks for reading. "
656,Sai ,"4.67*deep sigh*...that was...something, indeed. They don't make books like that anymore...ah, well. Change is inevitable...And the generations grow more...inauthentic...as a whole, that is...and in comparison to the newer/older/previous generations...Technology has its merits and de...nothing to or can be done about it...mmmph...Absently thinking about it later, and realized was so real, this story--was thinking Carroway got nothing out of this whole sojourn to the East, except this book, of course, all tidied up in it as a chapter of his life not actually part of--as if Nick was an actual person, having actually lived through and experienced this summer in reality, as if I was sad for him...this never happened before, for me, so I was pretty surprised, to say the least.Another thing this book is a first for: I felt as Nick felt about everything while reading, except for a couple of instances where Nick's feelings were not as I was feeling, per se, cuz as I was thinking Nick's thoughts, and they were pretty laid back?--if you can apply that--no, more accepting, and clear-sighted; so when those instances occurred I'd be a little taken aback, just a tad, then fall back in Nick's flow of thought. There was basically no reader's superiority , and this was pretty extraordinary. Another first.O.oHuh. Now that I look at the two firsts, I guess they're co-dependent...interesting.As it is, a pleasure for a read. :)"
657,Fiona Moran,"One of my favorite books of all time. Every time I read I fall more in love with the way Fitzgerald writes and describes the world around him. The Great Gatsby is a perfect combination of love, lust, and lost. This book will forever been near and dear to me. ""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
658,Bea,"By far my favorite book I read in school. Love the mystery of it, the intrigue, the voice. Obsessed with the era and style. Plus I have a super crush on Nick...and Gatsby of course. I need to re-read it!It's amazing what 5 years of living can do. After re-reading Gatsby for the first time since high school, my love for F. Scott only increased. I definitely ""got"" the book much more and appreciated its beauty (SO MANY PRETTY WORDS!!!) I can understand now why it is the great American book - a story of the American dream, working your way up from nothing and succeeding in wealth, and the tragic realization that success cannot buy happiness or love. This book is amazingly just as relevant today, if not more so - the themes of materialism and wealth and the search for happiness. I think that's the mark of a true classic, a piece of literature which remains relevant throughout time. Other things I noticed that I hadn't before:-After reading the Love Letters of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda (which I would recommend everyone read!), I could clearly see similarities between Daisy and Zelda and even Gatsby and Zelda. Like Fitzgerald's relationship with Zelda, Daisy and Gatsby's was tragic, infuriating and beautiful.-I am pretty certain Nick is gay, which I never realized before. Please refer to the end of chapter 2. Plus Nick's line, ""Thirty- the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know...""- I FINALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL THIS GREEN LIGHT NONSENSE IS ABOUT! Plus LOTS of symbolism regarding the color yellow. Please refer to John Green's video below, which talks about ithttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9Au9...-The final page of The Great Gatsby is probably the most beautifully written combination of words I've ever read! ""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter - tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther...And one fine morning - So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."" END SCENE. BEAUTIFUL!Anyway, enough of my going on and on. This book most definitely is and forever will be a classic and will hold a special place in my heart. "
659,Ahmed Wahab,"One word, fantastic! When I initially read the book, I thought it would be an average read, I only read it because its a known book, and I wanted to see why myself. Once I got really into the book, which was about three pages in, I couldn't stop! I'm the type of guy that doesn't read very often, however when I'm into a book, I get really into it. I have a pdf version of the book saved to my desktop and I have a copy, this is because I liked reading the book wherever I go. Fitzgerald used many techniques to convey his abstract ideas. I believe that the way in which the characters were portrayed had to be by far the most appealing element to me. I was really intrigued by the way every character had something hidden to them. Especially Gatsby. Do I recommend this book? Of course I do! If you like books, you will love The Great Gatsby. Not an easy read, but definitely very worth it, time flies when you are having fun, which basically means that time will fly when you are reading The Great Gatsby. Thank you all, please add me for more reviews! "

661,Brad,"To all of the 11th-graders of the world, I can answer that eternal question: Just how great was Gatsby?The answer: pretty great. "
662,Courtney Stephens,"Having not read this in high school, I made it my goal to finish it in college after watching the newest movie this fall semester. For those of you have not read this should absolutely do so. It is one of my favorites and I'm kind of disappointed it wasn't taught to me in my high school. I think that not only is the story awesome and has a lot to say about the 20's, but it is written so artfully and the way that Nick describes things in his diaries and how he idolizes Gatsby is what makes it so amazing.Summary: It is the summer of 1922 and Nick Carraway writes in his diary about how he is spending his days in West Egg, a wealthy town full of people living lavish lifestyles. Nick himself lives in a particularly smaller home right next a mansion owned by Gatsby. He talks about the huge parties Gatsby throws at night that never seem to end. In East Egg, Nick is invited to have dinner at his cousin Daisy's place and her husband Tom Buchanan's, who attended Yale with Nick. He is introduced to Daisy's friend Jordan Baker, a professional golfer, who tells him how Tom is cheating on Daisy when the two leave the room. One day while riding through the city with Tom, Nick discovers how dirty the town is and refers to it as the valley of ashes. They stop at George Wilson's garage where Tom goes to visit George's wife, and his lover, Myrtle. Nick discovers the alternative life Tom lives with Myrtle where they drink excessively and party. While at home one day Nick receives an invitation to attend Gatsby's party. When he walks through his yard to make an appearance he asks guests where he could find the host Gatsby to thank him for the invite. Everyone admits that they've never met the guy but that they've heard stories about being a spy and killing a man once. He eventually meets the great Jay Gatsby and learns that they both served in the same division during the war. He also runs into Jordan Baker who also speaks to Gatsby. After time goes on Jordan and Nick begin seeing each other after much effort from Daisy and Tom to match them together. At some point Jordan reveals to Nick that during her conversation with Gatsby at the party she learned that he and Daisy used to be together before he left for war. He admits that he is still in love with her and ask Jordan to convince Nick to reunite Daisy and Jay. So Nick arranges a tea party where the two are reunited and instantly sparks fly all over again. She visits Gatsby's mansion and Nick tags along learning all the details his new friend has put into his home. It is several weeks later and Nick hasn't heard anything from either. Daisy and Gatsby had been seeing each other for some time. One day Nick, Jay, Daisy, Tom and Jordan are all having lunch and it is apparent to Tom that his wife and Gatsby have something going on. Daisy suggests going into the city and asked Gatsby if he would like to ride. Tom wishes to go to the city as well and takes Gatsby yellow car. He stops at George Wilson's shop to get gas where he discovers George has learned about his wife cheating. On the ride back to town, Tom, Jordan and Nick discover Myrtle has been struck by a car and has died. The car was Gatsby's, which Daisy and Jay had traded out with Tom in the city. Daisy was driving when Myrtle was hit. Later when Daisy returns home her and Tom make up and she decides not to return to Gatsby. The next day when Nick leaves for work he tells Gatsby not to worry about the Buchanans anymore and to move on. When he returns from work he finds Gatsby floating in his pool dead. He had been shot by George Wilson who believed Gatsby was having the affair with Myrtle and had hit her with his car. 1) The color green is apparent through the book, but why in particularly is it the color of the light at the end of the Buchanan's dock?2) What do the eyes on the billboard represent for the people in the city?3) Why doesn't Daisy act as a mother to her daughter? "
663,Thea ,"What I love most about this book (aside from the beautiful writing of course) is the characters. Although some were insufferable, I appreciated who they were as people. And again, the writing was on point. "
664,TAMMY L. BYRNE,"People should remember this is a period piece, written about the jazz age of the 20's before the stock market crash. It's about the rich and young who's playground and excess is paid for by their parent fortunes. Gatsby from a poor upbringing made money (to rival the old rich) the best way he could. Wanting to recapture the love of Daisy this is the only way he could. She was money from the day she was born. But even in the ending and the love she had for Gatsby could not take her away from what she had only ever know-money and the life of security and all that it. Brings. Gatsby purity of intent and all his love could never break the shell in which she had been born . To think this in any way parallels a reality show or that he is a modern day drug dealer is sad because this is a truly a love story. The only fault of Gatsby is being naive to think that love he had for Daisy could win over money."
665,Bram,"I was talking to a friend the other day about this book, and we both agreed that it was overrated, especially since it is sometimes/often claimed to be the greatest American novel (or at least of the last century). After reading This Side of Paradise out of a yearning for college nostalgia, I decided to give Gatsby another go. And it quickly became evident that my recent supercilious comments on its quality were based only on vague recollections of high school English and my own tendency toward conversational ostentation. This work is not overrated. Not at all. The aspect I found particularly fascinating is the use of deception--all of the characters deceive (both themselves and others) with reckless abandon throughout the novel, which Nick is somewhat over-ready to relay to the reader. And even after he claims that ""everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known"", his own reliability as a narrator is eventually called into question by his (ex)flame, Jordan (as if his overly-innocent passivity throughout the novel wasn't enough of a tip-off). No doubt about it--this is a masterfully-concocted tale in which Fitzgerald displays an almost preternatural economy of storytelling. "
666,Bridget,"The Great GatsbyF. Scott Fitzgerald180 pagesI don't feel I have the credibility to really write a review of the novel, therefore I would like to use the opportunity of this 100th post to discuss what is said to be the greatest American novel of all time: The Great Gatsby. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and beauty in the world. - page 68 New York, 1922. The Jazz Age is in full swing, and with World War I at a close, the American people are restless, alive with post-war excitement and opportunity. Nick Carraway has just moved to Long Island looking to get started in the ""bond business"", and winds up buying a home next door to the grand and mysterious Jay Gatsby. After being invited to one of his neighbor's lavish parties, Nick soon learns of Gatsby's secrets, and the love he is desperately trying to find again. The following are some of my favorite passages from the book, and my understanding of them. Each of the selections refer to a prominent theme of the novel or a character that Fitzgerald so genuinely created. But I can still read the gray names, and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted Gatsby's hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him. -page 61 In this chapter of the the novel, Nick lists all of the people who attended Gatsby's parties that summer. To me, this was one of the most interesting sections. All of these people, businessmen, actors and actresses, politicians, and housewives, some invited and some not, came to sprawl out in his lawn furniture, drink his liquor, and dance to his music - but did him the favor of knowing nothing about him. Some visitors had never even met the fabled Mr. Gatsby, some failed to believe he even existed. At least a dozen men, some of them a little better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond. ""Back out,"" he suggested after a moment. ""Put her in reverse."" ""But the wheel's off!"" ""No harm in trying."" he said. -page 55In this scene, a drunk driver has driven his new car into a ditch after pulling out of Gatsby's driveway. He fails to understand that it is impossible to drive the car now that the wheel has fallen off, and is determined to get his hands back on the wheel. This hidden metaphor represents the true American spirit in the eyes of Fitzgerald. He believes in the American will to keep going after times of trouble. Whether that has been after losing a job, overcoming an illness, or wrecking a car, the American dream has always been to go on. ""If it wasn't for the mist we could see your home across the bay,"" said Gatsby. ""You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock."" -page 92Here Gatsby explains to Daisy that her house is directly across from his, only a vast expanse of water separating them from one another. This ""green light"" not only stands for his goal to win back Daisy's heart, but for the elaborate future he had planned out for himself as a young child. Gatsby's dreams will always be there, like the green light, which will shine bright until it is turned off. The problem with Gatsby's planned-out future is that no matter how hard he tries to swim across the bay to reach it, he never will, as the buoy of fate will prevent him from ever reaching the opposite shore. This is the Valley of Ashes - a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens...The eyes of Doctor T.J Eckleburg are blue and gigantic - their retinas one-yard high. They look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of spectacles which pass over a non-existent nose...his eyes, dimmed a little by paintless days under sun and rain, brood over the solemn dumping ground. -page 23All of the major events of this story take place under the watchful gaze of Doctor T.J Eckleburg. Several views can be taken on what he is meant to symbolize, but I narrowed down my opinions to just two. 1) Eckleburg has no fingers, or arms, only eyes, and I take that to mean that people do too much watching and not enough doing. We tend to sit back and stare at the corruption, the wrong, the criminal - and never often enough use our hands to make a change. 2) The eyes of Eckleburg represent God in a way that makes us believe that He sees everything we do, but lets us discover for ourselves the best possible way to fix our mistakes."
667,Megan (Read. Write. Ramble.),"A while ago I found some old books that used to belong to my mom in her parents' house. Among them was her copy of The Great Gatsby and with the movie coming out, I decided that I needed to finish it before I saw the movie in order to be able to decide how accurate it was. First of all, I love Gatsby. Even though like the rest of the characters he had moments where I just wanted to shake him, for the majority of the time I just felt for him. I mean, the poor guy has spent the last five years looking for Daisy because he can't get over how in love with her he is. Plus, I really just want to go to one of his parties. Partying with Jay Gatsby sounds totally awesome. As far as the rest of the characters go, I absolutely hated Tom Buchanan. He came across as a rich snob who was completely obsessed with himself and being in control. This was probably the intention behind the way F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote his character, but he still bothered me more than the others. His wife Daisy was irritating most of the time, but I still felt bad for her a few times. She seemed to be constantly smothered by her husband. The rest of the characters I was a bit indifferent towards. Nick didn't have much of a personality himself because he was narrating everyone else's lives, but it was pretty funny how he was the perpetual third wheel. Overall though, the characters all served their purpose in the story well and there was good development throughout the story too.The descriptions in this book, while sometimes a bit difficult to follow, were beautifully written and created a clear picture of the setting in my mind. The symbolism was also a definite strong point with the green light and the eyes on the billboard. The Great Gatsby was another classic book that I really liked and I would definitely recommend it, especially if you love the 1920's. Finally, a quick word about the movie. On Friday, Rachel and I went to see it with a group of our friends. There were about nine of us taking up an entire corner of the theater and fangirling the entire time. The movie was really accurate to the book and all of the famous quotes were left in there. They were also able to make some creative decisions like inserting a few one liners that actually gave Nick some personality or using modern music that made the movie interesting. I loved getting to see all of the settings brought to life and in some cases it actually cleared up the descriptions in the book for me. While there were a few minor things that I didn't like, I thought the movie was really good for the most part and I would definitely call it a success. As for whether or not Leonardo DiCaprio made a good Gatsby, my friends and I all agreed that he made a GREAT Gatsby. :P Plus, Rachel actually said she liked him in a movie, so he must have done something right! If you liked the book, I'd definitely recommend seeing the movie. It definitely did the book justice. More reviews can be found at www.readwriteramble.blogspot.com"
668,Gavin Smith,"It's easy to see why so many people identify this as their favourite book. The plot gets straight to the point and never gets caught meandering through the back-stories of the various characters lives. The prose is elegant and sharp, with many passages that I read over two or three times just to enjoy them again. The larger themes remain timeless. Indeed, very little would need changed to make The Great Gatsby live and breath in our current one-percent owned reality. Gatsby is chewed up chasing an impossible dream while the people who inherited his dream (and surely Tom Buchanan more or less inherits Daisy) cruise on regardless. I also felt that there were some interesting mirrors to the work of James Joyce here. While Joyce shows Irish characters that wallow or are mired in Ireland's turbulent history, Fitzgerald writes about Americans that seek to accelerate away from their own pasts, forever chasing a party, a fortune, or a floating green light. What makes Gatsby so interesting is that he both wants to escape and recapture his past. (view spoiler)[ His name change and subsequent lack of history lead to the gossip at his parties focusing solely on where he came from. His pursuit of idealised youthful obsession paves the path to Tom Buchanan's door, where Tom uses Gatsby's own past to tear down his dream. (hide spoiler)]There's so much in this wonderfully small package. Read it for the sense of another place and time, read it to analyse your own place and time or just read it for the great quotes, but, seriously, read it!"
669,John Cheney,"This is F. Scott Fitzgerald's Great American Novel—a work in which he not only captures the zeitgeist of the Roarin' Twenties and its flapper culture, but weaves the story with his masterful command of prose. The prose, in fact, is the real showpiece here, for while the story is a compelling American tragedy, it is fairly simple.When mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby purchases a mansion in the fictional Long Island neighborhood of West Egg, he strikes up a friendship with his neighbor, modest bond salesman Nick Carraway. Over a series of parties and meetings, Carraway learns Gatsby has designs on Carraway's cousin, Daisy Buchanan. Gatsby and Daisy had been lovers before he was shipped off to Europe in World War I, and though Daisy has since married millionaire Tom Buchanan, Gatsby is not ready to let her go. It is the conflict between 'old money' Tom and 'new money' Gatsby for Daisy's affections that forms much of the themes of the novel, with the tragic and disastrous results creating a scathing indictment of the über-rich. The other resounding note of the novel is how Gatsby, a largely self-made man (even with some shady sponsors) who has the world in the palm of his hand, risks losing it all because of his one obsession with Daisy. In the words of a disillusioned Nick Carraway, “his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him.” "

671,Vasileios,"http://www.dreamersandco.com/2013/02/...Ο μεγάλος Γκάτσμπυ είναι ένα από τα βιβλία που ήθελα να διαβάσω εδώ και καιρό αν και το είχα αμελήσει. Για να πω την αλήθεια ήταν δύο οι λόγοι που με έκαναν να το διαβάσω τελευταία: η επερχόμενη ομότιτλη ταινία που θα κυκλοφορήσει αρκετά σύντομα (αν και υπήρχε και μία που κυκλοφόρησε την δεκαετία του '70), καθώς και η τέλεια συλλεκτική έκδοση των Penguin Classics σε σχέδια της Coralie Bickford-Smith... Στην Ελλάδα, αυτή τη περίοδο πρόσεξα δύο εκδόσεις του Γκάτσμπυ, αυτή των εκδόσεων Πατάκη και αυτή των εκδόσεων Άγρα. Αυτή που με κέρδισε αμέσως ήταν η δεύτερη. Η τέλεια ποιότητα χαρτιού, εκτύπωσης αλλά και μία πραγματικά καλή μετάφραση που είναι γνώριμο στοιχείο των Εκδόσεων Άγρα. Τι μου άφησε η ανάγνωσή του; Θεωρώ πως είναι από τα πιο ωραία βιβλία που διάβασα τα τελευταία χρόνια, όχι για το ιδιαίτερο θέμα του αλλά για την καταπληκτική προσέγγισή του από τον F. Scott Fitzgerald. Καταρχάς, με το που αρχίζεις την ανάγνωσή του σε περιμένει μια φράση που σε κάνει να ξεκινάς με τους καλύτερους οιωνούς και διάθεση. Ιδού: Όταν ήμουν μικρός και πιο ευάλωτος, ο πατέρας μου μου έδωσε μια συμβουλή που έκτοτε τη γυρίζω συνεχώς στο μυαλό μου.«Όποτε είσαι έτοιμος να κατακρίνεις κάποιον, να θυμάσαι οτι δεν είχαν όλοι τα δικά σου πλεονεκτήματα».Ένα από τα στοιχεία που με κέρδισε αμέσως ήταν οτι διάβαζα ένα βιβλίο με κύριο πρόσωπό του τον Γκάτσμπυ χωρίς να είναι αυτός η κεντρική φωνή του βιβλίου. Ο αφηγητής μας, Νικ μετακομίζει στη Νέα Υόρκη και θα γίνει ο γείτονας του Γκάτσμπυ αλλά και η αιτία για να συνδεθεί με την Νταίζυ. Ο Γκάτσμπυ είναι πάμπλουτος, μένει στο West Egg της Νέας Υόρκης σε ένα τεράστιο σπίτι όπου κάθε Σάββατο βράδυ γίνεται πανικός από τον κόσμο που έρχεται να απολαύσει τα θαυμαστά πάρτι του. Όμως, κανείς δεν ξέρει από που έρχεται, ούτε πως κατέχει μια τόσο μεγάλη περιουσία. Πολλοί από αυτούς δεν τον γνωρίζουν καν προσωπικά. Ο Νικ μας λέει για τον Γκάτσμπυ πως το οτι εργάστηκε κάποια στιγμή για έναν εκατομμυριούχο τον έκανε να αφιερώσει όλη του τη ζωή έχοντας ως κίνητρο την απόκτηση πλούτου. Εκ των υστέρων μαθαίνουμε πως η περιουσία του αποκτήθηκε από παράνομες πράξεις κάτι που αν και περίεργο δεν στερεί σε τίποτα τη γνώμη που έχουμε για τον χαρακτήρα του Γκάτσμπυ: Ένα ονειροπόλο πνεύμα που έκανε τα πάντα για να καταφέρει να έχει την κοινωνική θέση που θα έφερνε τη Νταίζυ κοντά του και μια προσωπικότητα με μεγάλη ανάγκη να μετατρέψει τα όνειρά του σε πραγματικότητα. Αυτό οφείλεται στην φοβερή γραφή του F. Scott Fitzgerald. H Νταίζυ από την άλλη, αν και είχε αγαπήσει τον Γκάτσμπυ και του είχε υποσχεθεί πως θα τον περιμένει για να παντρευτούν, με τη πρώτη ευκαιρία που κάποιος Τομ τη ζητάει σε γάμο δέχεται αμέσως. Ο Τομ, πάμπλουτος και αυτός με αρκετά στοιχεία υπεροψίας και αγένεια δεν θα μπορέσει να κατευνάσει τη ζήλια του για τη Νταίζυ και τον Γκάτσμπυ, δημιουργώντας αρκετές σκηνές.Την ανεκπλήρωτη και πληγωμένη αγάπη μεταξύ Γκάτσμπυ και Νταίζυς πραγματεύεται το βιβλίο μαζί και με άλλα θέματα που στην ουσία σκιαγραφούν τη δεκαετία του '20 στην Αμερική με κύριο θέμα το Αμερικανικό Όνειρο. Αυτό ξεκίνησε ως η ολοκλήρωση μέσω της αναζήτηση της ευτυχίας και μετατράπηκε ακριβώς από την ίδια την ανάγκη του κόσμου μετά τους πολέμους ως αναζήτηση του χρήματος αλλά και της υλικής επιτυχίας, κάτι που κυνηγούσε και ο Γκάτσμπυ. Μία απο τις πιο δυνατές στιγμές του βιβλίου είναι αυτή που ο Γκάτσμπυ λέει στον κηπουρό του να περιμένει λίγο ακόμη για να αδειάσει την πισίνα του, δεν την είχε χρησιμοποιήσει ποτέ. Μέχρι εδώ σας λέω, δεν θέλω να αναφέρω κάτι άλλο. Τέλος, ο Νικ μιλώντας με τον πατέρα του Γκάτσμπυ, Χένρι του εξηγεί πόσο περήφανος είναι για τον γιο του, ενώ του δείχνει και ένα βιβλίο που είχε όταν ήταν μικρός και είχε γράψει ένα ειδικό πρόγραμμα που «έπρεπε» να ακολουθεί, ένα πρόγραμμα αυτοβελτίωσης που θα τον οδηγούσε μια μέρα σε αυτό που είχε ονειρευτεί. Ο Μεγάλος Γκάτσμπυ είναι ένα από τα πιο κλασικά βιβλία του 20ού αιώνα και σίγουρα δεν θα αρκεστώ σε μία μόνο ανάγνωσή του. "

674,Alexa Bonvie,The Great Gatsby was one of the top ten greatest books that I have read! I loved the detail and the thought that was put into this book. I think that this is the type of book that I could read over and find a new meaning to every time I would read it. I am completely in love with this book!!
675,Tania Lukinyuk,"One wise man told me that if you don't come back to the books you've read, you are reading the same book over and over. It took me time to take this in and voila! - this is the first book I re-read in my life, after 20 years of break. It was inspired by the newly released Gatsby remake which I actually did not see. Fitzgerald is true magician who created a story which is so authentically American with poor always losing to rich, and so inherently French with fatal raptures ruining lives of people. The characters are rich, vivid, so three-dimensional that at times I felt that I could touch them. The only character which strikes me as blank and instrumental is Gatsby himself. It almost feels that it is totally unimportant who he is - what matters is the feeling, the emotion, the passion which fills the story. Emotion over individual. Loved it."
676,Rowstark,"""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.""¿Sabéis de esos libros que te cambia la vida? Pues eso me ha pasado cuando he leído ""The great Gatsby"".Si pudiera darle diez estrellas, se lo daría. Se ha convertido en uno de mis libros favoritos, sin duda alguna. No sabía NADA de la historia y me alegra no haberme informado antes de leermelo... ¿La única pega? Se me ha hecho corto. "

678,Stacey Avis,"I was suppose to read this in high school but faked my way through it. What I did hear and discuss in class I liked. Now that I finally read it, I enjoyed it.

I'm glad I finally read it.Reading challenge- book I was suppose to read in high school but didnt"
679,Heather,"""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made..."" I have loved this book since I first read it twenty-odd years ago. I have also loved the Robert Redford and Mia Farrow movie version of the book. As I read the book again, I was struck at how well-cast the movie was and how it evoked the same thoughts I had while reading--such as the thoughtless, narcissistic attitude Tom and Daisy had towards others. I was also struck by Gatsby's determination to have something that was already gone and irretrievable. You can't go home again. For instance, he was shocked when he actually saw Daisy's daughter. For him, the little girl couldn't possibly exist. ""He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that is was already behind him."""
680,Keith A.," The Great Gatsby is an American classic and a must read for any book lover. F. Scott Fitzgerald, like many authors, based much of his work on his life, and The Great Gatsby is no exception. Gatsby as a character, including his history, parallel Fitzgerald's throughout the course of the book, and the reader can feel the emotion that Fitzgerald displays through Gatsby. Similarly, Nick Carraway, both the narrator and one of the main characters of the book, picks apart and examines each aspect of Gatsby. Carraway considers feelings, motivations, and ideas about Gatsby, and because Gatsby is based on Fitzgerald's own life, Nick's views are indirectly conclusions Fitzgerald has made about himself. Nick puts it best when he says, both as a character and a representation of the author, ""I was within and without."" This subtle peek into Fitzgerald's mind, seamlessly woven together with universal themes of the American Dream, what is truly valuable in life, and the importance of moving on, combine to generate a deeply profound experience for the reader. This is one of a rare few books that can make a person consider or realize, ""Am I like these characters?"" and thus change how one views the world. In a society which has the same lax morals and flowing wealth as Jazz Age America, the message within The Great Gatsby holds value for the current generation. It warns of the problems with holding on to the past or valuing money above all else, and teaches that the ""American Dream"", while achievable, may not be all it's cracked up to be. Yes, as long as there are people left on this earth, The Great Gatsby will hold a wealth of eye-opening knowledge for those wise enough to seek it."
681,Haileychellis,"Usually staying away from old classic novels, I find myself more into action packed, page turning fiction. This month, one of the books I decided to pick up was The Great Gatsby By: F.Scott Fitzgerald. I had seen the Great Gatsby in my recommended list on GoodReads, but was a bit skeptical of if it was a book that I would find myself really getting into. Because it was pretty short (also reading The Heart is a Lonely Hunter for class), I decided to give it a chance. I was immediately captivated by Fitzgerald’s writing style and craft. His sentences and metaphors flowed nicely, but still made you stop and think about what he was still trying to say. I also really admire his techniques of character development in such a short book. Each character had a certain amount of mystery and complexity that was interesting to follow as each one changed throughout the book. In The Great Gatsby, set in the summer 1922, we follow a group of high society characters living in Long Island. The story is narrated from the point of view of Nick Carraway, a man born into the wealth and good fortune of his family’s past. He moves to Long Island for a job in New York, and ends up seeking out his cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom.  Nick ends up living in a small eyesore of a home compared to the mansion next door which belongs to no other than Jay Gatsby. One night at Gatsby’s wild party, Nick is introduced to Mr. Gatsby by Jordan Baker, a harsh, independant woman. Nick and Jordan become close friends along with Nick also developing a friendship with Jay.  Later on in the book, we learn from Jordan that Daisy and Gatsby used to be in love before he went off to war. Gatsby uses Nick as a way for them to reunite and fall back in love. As the plan is executed, Nick learns more about where Gatsby’s past and where he came from- a low class, uneducated family. Tom, Daisy, Jordan, and even Nick all were born into the wealth and high end lifestyle of Long Island, never experiencing what Gatsby had to do to get to where he is now. Gatsby had created a whole second life for himself in order to impress and charm Daisy. Even in each of their fortune and fame, money couldn’t purchase each of their separate yearnings. This raises the question of can money really buy happiness. As a child all Gatsby knew was his life of poverty, and dreaming of the high class lifestyle of people around him. Even though Gatsby built his entire life in order to impress Daisy with things such as the mansion and car, the materialistic items only hold so much, and he again loses her to Tom. This quote is from Nick at the very end of the book, talking about how Gatsby lost his happiness in North Dakota when he left to build his wealth.“He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night. Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but thats no matter -tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther….And one fine morning--” (Fitzgerald, 193)I think that this lesson stayed with me the most because it is still a very classic and relatable topic in today’s society. I not only find others, but also find myself commonly forgetting this in day to day life. We get caught up in the, “If I only had this, I would be happy”, mindset. There are stories of people who live off of nothing but are still perfectly happy and proud of their life and accomplishments. I do think that reading this book has opened up my mind further by putting it in the perspective of someone who does “have it all” but is still unhappy. I realized that money can do a lot, but it can’t solve everything. Once you stumble across one of these problems that money can’t solve, you become stuck and nothing else matters. I would absolutely give this book 5 out of 5 stars."
682,Lily Slifer,"I give ""The Great Gatsby"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald 5 out of 5 stars.""The Great Gatsby"" is an amazing love story full of mystery, wonder and excitement. This is a classic, fiction novel that anyone who reads it would enjoy. It tells the story of young extravagant people in the 1920s who are affected by greed, sadness and adventurous events. The reader discovers a new world that contains characters that are free spirits and do not have a care of what the future holds for them, which Fitzgerald teaches could be a very bad thing due to its ending. F. Scott Fitzgerald's narrative style of writing is very effective in this novel due to it's chronological order when telling the story. Chronological order keeps the reader on edge and looking for more to the story. While reading this novel, there were parts that I really began to enjoy. I enjoyed the power that Gatsby possessed from his enormous amounts of money, though it was collected from illegal actions. As well as this power, I also enjoyed reading about the lifestyle of the setting of this novel. The way people socialized and interacted in the 1920s is very different from the way that people socialize and interact today. F. Scott Fitzgerald created a novel that not only displayed a certain adventurous love between two people but gave the reader a look into a mysterious world of young socialization in the 20s full of lies, gambling and gossip. I thought that the point of view in this novel was very interesting as well. There were few things that I did not like about this novel. These things included the sadness that was portrayed in the book because it made it kind of depressing and the fact that it had a tragic ending.I would recommend this novel to anyone looking for a good read, anyone who loves reading about the 1920s and/or anyone who enjoys tragic love stories. ""The Great Gatsby"" has a great plot, and again I give it 5 out of 5 stars. I would definitely read it again."
683,midnightfaerie,"This bombastic roaring novel goes from eliciting Bronx Cheers to being the Cat's Meow. A faithful embodiment of what the twenties were like, the book thrusts us into the thick of things with no buildup whatsoever other than the most beautiful of slanged prose. ""The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men."" I've never known an author to use such different styles of adjectives, from classical to modern vernacular, and have it come off as anything less than choppy. But Fitzgerald pulls it off, over and over again. His writing astounds me and leaves me breathless with new experiences, and for that, I thank him. The story is told from Nick Carraway's point of view, both a participant in the story and also someone who fades easily into the background to observe. It seems from a surface look at his writing, that he despises these people he associates with, and finds their habits and actions distasteful, yet he can't seem to get away from them. He is fascinated and repelled at the same time. ""There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired."" Living next to Jay Gatsby, he is pulled into the life of the rich socialites. At first he thinks it's because of mere whim but then finds out it's because Gatsby wants an afternoon tea arranged with one Daisy Buchanan, Nick's cousin, a married woman, and the girl whom Gatsby was once in love with. Nick arranges it against his better judgment and from there, the story never seems to slow down. Whether fast-paced in action, or fascinating conjecture of life's little moments, this book had me hooked from beginning to end. ""Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age."" Fitzgerald has a unique and different style of writing that doesn't come close to anything I've ever read before. He also has an uncanny way of making you not only be able to imagine the 1920's, but feel it, taste it, smell it, and, in this case, sweat it. All of it adding to the list of reasons we should consider him a classical writer. There are many underlying themes here, not the least of which are love, hate, revenge, guilt, self-worth, and infidelity. The Great Gatsby has definitely withstood the test of time, selling more books with each passing year, and along with the magic factor, he also has a huge following. For all these reasons and more, I consider this book a classic. ""It vanished in the trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.""One last thing I'd like to mention is that I'm really looking forward to the movie coming out in May. And it was in no small part of my decision for reading this book on my list. I also have to say, Leonardo Dicaprio never impressed me much in Titanic, my first movie of him. But then I saw Who's Eating Gilbert Grape, and Gangs of New York, and Catch me If you Can, and Blood Diamond. And even though I never particularly enjoyed watching him, I was greatly impressed with his talent, and grew to enjoy watching him, so that when I heard he was going to play Gatsby, I was satisfied that he would do the character justice. Dicaprio, combined with Toby Maguire, was enough to make me blissfully anticipate the coming of this film. I do believe, ever since Spider-man, the critics don't give Maguire enough credit as an actor. But I will never forget him in The Cider House Rules and especially The Ice Storm. Those alone give him credit as an actor. So, I happily look forward to watching this movie, especially after having just added this book to my favorites.  ClassicsDefined.com"
684,Walter,"In the spirit of full disclosure, this is my favorite work of fiction (and indeed book) of all time, so my ""objectivity"" could be an open question. This being said, I am even more impressed with it after this last re-read, a decade or so since the previous one. Fitzgerald's storytelling and social commentary are still incredibly prescient more than eighty years after Gatsby's debut.Ostensibly, this is the story of Jay Gatsby, a hopeless romantic and self-made man with an obsession with the woman he lost, the fair Daisy Buchanan. Yet it's also the story of Nick Carraway and his coming of age/loss of innocence as a result of coming east. And it's a tableau of the early Jazz Age, a time of extremes that presages the current day.Simply put, the character development is strong, the imagery memorable - who can't picture Gatsby on the dock gazingly longingly at the green light at the end of Daisy's dock or see the eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckelburg watching over the road in the Valley of Ashes? - and the moral clear. Along the way, we are treated to the reality that the protagonists are horribly flawed - and only marginally less so than the antagonists herein - and the time in which they live seems largely devoid of a morality that would save them all (or, at least, the part of the world in which they live is).The funny thing to me is that, over time, my appreciation for Gatsby and its meaning has evolved. When I first encountered it many years ago in high school, I was drawn to the characters - revolting as so many of them were and are - and to the incredible depiction of a unique time in history (or so I thought at the time). Now, I'm more impressed with and moved by the piercing social commentary that is just as illuminating so many years later. Also, the imagery of the book - the green dock light, the optometrist's sign, the Valley of Ashes - lingers and haunts more now. Perhaps one way to describe how the book's effect on me has changed is that initially it was an interesting story to me, an opportunity to experience a world at once a unique moment in time and long gone; now the imagery resonates in a way that I can picture that world and ""see"" it and the lessons that it teaches even now. More important than the characters is the trove of lessons that their lives teaches, wisdom that transcends time and is reflected in and instructive to all ages, including the present day.For this universal insight, I recommend Gatsby highly. Those looking for unique and compellingly drawn characters will be rewarded. Those seeking a morality tale for the ages will find it here. Those wanting to go back in time to understand the present day will be insightfully informed. Those who are willing to be positively affected in real life by a work of make-believe will certainly experience this, too. In sum, anyone willing to have their perspective on life changed and elevated will receive this gift from Fitzgerald's masterpiece."
685,Idalia,"Above perfect average writing intricately deep with every line, The Great Gatsby doesn't disappoint. In fact, you learn alot about yourself that you didn't know before reading it. If it wasn't because I had to read this for school, I would have never in my wildest dreams given this book a chance. I came to discover, why it's a classic and why it's still a popular book today. It's the complex, fascinating writing about chasing a single dream to reach the America Dream and love, that still keeps people picking up the book today.Nick, a simple guy who reserves himself from judgment, tells the story about Jay Gatsby. Gatsby is a penniless soldier who falls in love with Daisy a rich chick with class and money. Gatsby falls madly in love for Daisy and her class, so he pursues her, her love, and the American Dream. She's too glorious for Gatsby to resist. In the effort to attain her love, Gatsby builds his life with money, fame, recognition, fortune, and luxury to win her heart.This love story is unlike any other, Gatsby would do anything in his power to get Daisy to love him. As readers, we learn how far is too far? Can loving too much be dangerous? Can money buy love? What happens when you live for so long with a single dream? Plus, the most melancholic beautiful thing - the aftermath and consequence to living with a single dream for so long like Gatsby.From the beginning the book holds strong depth that takes you to other dimensions to discover the emptiness in people soul's even though they're surrounded by luxury. There's a fast-moving, thought-provoking beautiful flow of symbolism, metaphors, similes, you name it. It's packed with so much truth- like how in the end dreams are like roses and the sun. Roses have thorns and fade away eventually, while the sun burns you (symbolism used in the book). To sum up, it's an important timeless classic that is brilliantly woven. That will teach you about love, dreams, lies, justice, social differences, hate, money and what it can (and cannot) buy..., while enjoying the twists and turns and surprising ending. Give this one a chance!"
686,Aanchal Jairath,"the book is amazing , and it transforms us to time long passed . it shows us love , friendship , greatness and influences of money. It shows New York , it shows the twenties , and it shows the greatness of Gatsby ."
687,Joy Gerbode,"This is really a good read ... but I'm not exactly sure why. It's actually a little bit depressing, as the story goes ... but the writing is wonderful. There are some beautiful phrases and paragraphs. The story is a basic story of certain people, but even more, it is a story of America just after WWI, and the American Dream. Altogether a fairly easy read, but a very deep subject matter. Known as ""the Great American Novel"", I love author John Green's assessment that it is so named, not so much because of its greatness or of its novel-ness, but because of its American ness. Thoroughly enjoyed this book.Second read ... was even better. I had some understanding of the symbols and stereotypes, and the themes and messages this time, and I enjoyed the story line a bit more. Love the final lines ... ""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.""Third read ... enjoyed it yet again. Although it is a book filled with some of the worst sides of humanity, still the lessons (i.e. ""God is always watching"" ... ""you can't run from your past"" etc.) are all beautifully exposed in the pages of this seamy story."
688,Jennifer Varela,"The Great Gatsby is by far my favorite book of all time. My favorite thing about this book is that the author doesn’t give us that cliche happy ending and instead gives us an unexpected plot twist that breaks the readers heart. Every single character is easily identified thanks to their differences and Nick Carraway, the narrator, speaks in a way that shows exactly what he was going through during every event. I will never get over this book due to it’s immense creativity and power. It blows my mind the way Gatsby was completely in love with Daisy. He devoted his whole life just to find her and be with her again but destiny had other plans for both of them. I read this book my junior year of high school in my English class and I couldn’t help but read ahead and finish before everyone else because it was so difficult to put down. This is the best book of all time, hands down. "
689,Gail,"You know when you reread a book you read years ago, and on the one hand it's exactly as you remember it, but on the other hand, you see so much more in it than you saw before, because your experience of the world and understanding of people and language and literature is so much more developed now?I read The Great Gatsby at age 15 for school, and loved it then, in a fascinated, excited way - it was the very first book we had to read for A Level English, my first time examining a novel in depth, and so there was all the thrill of adventure about it! I even still have the essays I wrote about it - good essays, that got me A grades and were used as coursework, but also quite naive in my understanding of the world. Now, reading it again, nearly 25 years later, I was expecting to see all kinds of things that I'd forgotten, but in fact the plot, the characters, the words, were pretty much as I remembered them. But my interpretation, my understanding, was different. There is so much more in it - so many more layers - than I'd realised at the time. Characters that seemed bizarre and unreal at 15 now seem familiar to me - I know people like this. I know what Fitzgerald is talking about. And the sensory descriptions, the symbolism, the many things that are not said outright, but are suggested subtly. I feel I need to read it again, at least one more time, to fully get a sense of these things. Interesting undercurrents regarding race, sexuality, gender. And the theme of honesty - different types of honesty and dishonest, the question of what is honesty, and is Nick really the honest chap he sees himself as? I miss studying literature - I would love to explore these questions in essays, but realistically, I would never randomly do so. I'd have to be studying a course!"
690,Annie,"The roaring twenties are in full swing in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s, The Great Gatsby. The novel is told through the point of view of Nick Carraway, a young man who came to New York to become a bonds man. The reader easily trusts in Nick’s opinions of other characters because Nick does not fall into enchanting wealth he is surrounded by and because in the second paragraph of the book he is thinking about the advice his father gave him, “Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.” 	Nick moves into an eighty dollar a month cardboard box in West Egg, a prestigious neighborhood, but not as prestigious as to the old money families living in East Egg. Gatsby is Nick’s mysterious and gaudily wealth neighbor. Nick comes home one night after having dinner with his cousin Daisy and her husband Tom and sees Gatsby from across his lawn, “he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, as far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far way.” What was the green light? Was Gatsby reaching toward the houses in East Egg and all the money and status that came with or was it something more? This question is looming throughout the novel. 	How Gatsby accumulated all his wealth is a mystery throughout the novel. Gatsby grew up out west in a non-wealthy family and served in the wars over seas. He befriended an extremely wealthy man, Don Cody, and ever since then decided that he wanted and needed to be wealthy. 	Gatsby and Daisy had a young romantic love. Gatsby was unfortunately shipped off to war and he was not good enough to be with Daisy. Daisy went off and married Tom, a wealthy and handsome man, in an extravagant marriage while Gatsby went an amassed a fortune for himself. Gatsby and Daisy are later reunited with help from Nick and the love comes rushing back, but Daisy is still married to Tom and Gatsby cannot change the fact that he was not born into a wealthy family. Nick is meanwhile hanging back and observing all of the lies, hypocrisy and mania that is happening between people with too much time and money. 	The American Dream is ringing throughout the Great Gatsby. Gatsby was able to bring himself up from the poor family he was born into and make a name for himself. This is fully representative of the American Dream. Gatsby had a dream and he went for. Gatsby threw the most magnificent parties in West Egg and everyone knew his name in the upper east, but no one knew where his money came from and most people assumed he was a bootlegger or was involved in some other criminal activity. 	The Great Gatsby is an excellent book and every American in one point in their lifetime should read it. It fully represents the American way of life and how we always want what we cannot have and we need more of everything especially money. Everyone can learn something from Gatsby’s desperate attempt to become rich and win over Daisy. Money cannot buy everything and that point is clearly proven throughout this novel. 	The Great Gatsby reveals the heart of the American culture in the twenties. Life was filled with booze, parties and money and this is all shown in the Great Gatsby. Gatsby threw fabulous parties and drove expensive cars, but for what? What was he trying to accomplish by flaunting all of his wealth? This and more is all eventually revealed in The Great Gatsby. "
691,Merna ,"I’m not surprised that the great Gatsby is considered to be one of the greatest American novels. 
“He smiled understandingly – much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced – or seemed to face – the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.” 
I’m going to commence the review with none other than the central figure of the story: Gatsby.(I really need to watch the movie!) It’s vastly intriguing by how Fitzgerald displayed Gatsby. Especially, with how each chapter more of Gatsby’s background is revealed, until he becomes something entirely different to what we first perceived of him to actually be in the first three chapters. I occasionally was unable to decide if I liked Gatsby, or just thought he was simply naïve, nevertheless he was a spot-on developed character. Now, you would almost think that the story would be narrated by Gatsby. Yet, the author most likely wanted Gatsby to be seen by the eyes of an average person in the roaring twenties, or basically Nick can be seen as Fitzgerald's own voice in the book. He also wanted the mystery behind Gatsby to keep readers pondering on who he really was, of course. The actual narrator of the story is Nick who moves next door to a millionaire who throws extravagant parties every day. Nick finds himself drawn to the past and the daily life of Gatsby. Nick is presented as more of a secondary character during the course of the novel, he describes and comments on events, rather than ruling the action. He was one of the very few likable characters. I despised a lot of the others, but I suppose you were ought to. Gatsby’s tragic pursuit of his dream is what makes this one of the greatest American novels. You would have to read the book in order to discover what his dream is. Now, if you’re currently engrossed as I was on finding out more about Gatsby, then I do suggest you got out and get a copy."
692,Natalia,"Finally I wrote the review of this book as spoken and said since it was published. It's one of the most famous works of Scott Fitzgerald and, from what I've been able to observe, one of the closest.Certainly talk of The Great Gatsby is something that leads to debates and discussions, because everyone analyzes it and understand it in their own way, it's like Fitzgerald would have done it on purpose so that for generations ask us about the characters. And it's difficult to make an accurate analysis to start because is a first person narrator, the voice of Nick Carraway, talking about his neighbor, Jay Gatsby, a mysterious man with an enormous wealth that gives huge parties and eccentric inviting unknown people, no apparent reason other than to waste their wealth. Until Nick meets Gatsby and soon realizes that everything is for a woman, Nick's cousin, Daisy Buchanan, the greates love of Gatsby and married with Tom Buchanan, with a marriage and seemingly happy woman being a character in the much sought high society with a charm that falls everyone, but with a husband who doesn't hesitate to deceive. All characters in any moment are to assemble an inevitable climax that give you more than a turn. But mostly, this story is a satire on the upper classes the same Fitzgerald loved even while gave lots of headaches. It's a book where the two main characters are two sides of the author, the young idealist in search of success and the man who has everything, but at the same time has nothing and dream of a past that unfortunately no longer exists.Just as we might say that the character of Daisy is a possible presentation of his wife Zelda Fitzgerald, for her frivolous and almost bipolar attitude, plus her little character at various times. We can easily hate her for how she played with the feelings of Gatsby, but I think that would in part give the taste of the author. Just as we can easily hate Tom Buchanan so selfish and arrogant that is, as a villain classic novel where there is always a good and a bad. But Fitzgerald's writing has shown me that is not so well placed. You see, Daisy are a woman, who as she says ""has seen and done it all"", so it has become cynical about it. It's not the same young woman who knew Gatsby, which she loved him and waited for him, because love at distances rarely manage to overcome all obstacles, in my opinion. No one forced her to marry Tom, is a woman who needed something and somehow found him when she met him, plus he had all the qualities that parents approve of Daisy, I was young and very wealthy. I think Daisy would never have thought that as soon cheat. The reunion with Gatsby is like a window that opens, letting in fresh air, which becomes her first love, the young man who loved each other and wanted her, but which didn't expect him to forget everything demanded, because forgetting a fundamental part of life, such as marriage and a young daughter, is not something that is easily forgotten. In this way, I give a plus instead of Daisy Gatsby. But still, I think she's a woman who made bad decisions and didn't want her reputation to commit but leave unscathed from her slip and return to her comfortable life as it has always done, because for her, everything is a game . There's a part of you where she's still a little girl.Gatsby's character is one of the toughest I've had to deal with. He's a very intelligent and ambitious man who at thirty accomplished everything I ever wanted, luxury and wealth. He took the opportunity and took advantage as he skillfully presented, but a two-faced character. The face he shows to everyone, gentlemanly man with incredible manners, excellent crib, pleasing to all, sociable and fun host with huge parties and face the void with an impossible dream man whose true profession was be smuggler. Sometimes I feel sorry that wasted all the time waiting for Daisy when he could get ahead and settle with another woman who wanted, but psychologically speaking, both are two characters damaged, with a tendency to obsession, he obsessed with Daisy and repeat the past like the present didn't exist, and Daisy with a the tendency to pretend that nothing bad happened in her life and a patched smile like a doll on display. Gatsby is the dark side that was Scott Fitzgerald when his marriage was getting worse.In a way, it has always struck me detail about women who write Fitzgerald. Generally all are perfectly beautiful, well-born and socially acceptable, but with a little evil at heart. As if all women were bad and nothing is safe from this. Perhaps, as a romantic and seductive writer, the author didn't exactly good luck to meet women who were not of a frivolous atmosphere and stayed with the impression that all women in the world like Daisy Buchanan, Jordan Baker, Myrtle Wilson, Isabelle Borgé, Rosalind Connage or Nicole Diver, and many more. But if it were not so, I would not have given us the greatest works known by many and adapted several, very good ending or not having, The Great Gatsby is a mockery of the American dream, representing it or disguising it with life, the rise and fall of Gatsby, superficial and irresponsible Daisy Buchanan and vulnerable Nick Carraway, a character as he said early, avoided making judgments about others, but contradicting his words, it's something I did over and over again ever the novel progressed. The only fault I could find is their selfishness for his humility and his beliefs. The high morality can play against sometimes.My only advice here is to try to read it to understand its mode."
693,max,"I like this book more each time I re-read it. It is unquestionably a masterpiece that rivals many of the great American novels that preceded it. Fitzgerald's prose is exquisitely gorgeous. Richly figurative, occasionally synaesthetic language at times reminiscent of Keats adorns many a page. There are passages of such lyric intensity they read almost as if they were lifted from the choral odes of Greek tragedy.One of Fitzgerald's great gifts as a prose writer is his artful employment of such routine poetic devices as personification, metonomy, and numerous others. His use of these -- so effortless and natural -- is far more well developed in Gatsby than in the two novels he published before Gatsby: This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and Damned. For example, the narrator speaks of his home, a small cottage, having as an advantage ""the consoling proximity of millionaires."" This serves as an excellent example of a style that is found throughout the novel. With a single adjective he personifies an abstract noun, but the same adjective is in effect transferred from and just as well suited to the concrete noun ""millionaires."" Another, far more famous example is Daisy Buchanan having a voice with ""the sound of money."" This is a a very striking metonomy, where ""money"" = ""people who have money."" FSF was apparently quite fond of Keats and there are many instances of the great poet's influence in the style that is found throughout Gatsby, often to very humorous effect.The book operates on so many levels I hardly no where to begin. It deftly combines various genres, including tragedy, comedy, satire, romance, and more, including Platonism and the search for the holy grail. It is also a roman a clef, though not in an overt way such as Kerouac's On The Road.The bemused, detached, ironic and utterly unreliable narrator sucks you in from sentence no. 1. We only see Gatsby through Nick's eyes, and Nick is a conflicted character. He tells us who he is and what he believes, but he is either lying to us or simply the victim of his own smug illusions. Nick worships Gatsby just as Gatsby worships Daisy.This is an easy book to dislike, or at least seriously misinterpret. It is much more complicated than what appears at first blush. Daisy Fey -- great name -- is a siren, a temptress, a princess trapped inside a golden castle. So Gatsby goes on a heroic quest and builds a castle of his own to lure her there. But it is a spectral, vacant monstrosity, haunted by his own failed dreams. He is a romantic hero straight out of a European 19th century novel, the man from the provinces seeking to make his way in a world that offers fame, money, status and love, not without greed, corruption, and violence. Gatsby is quintessentially American in that he comes from nowhere with nothing and completely reinvents himself with a new image in a different location, albeit one to which he is very much a stranger. This is a story that is played out day after day after dreary day in America. It is also one that FSF captured with a stroke or artistic genius in this novel.In the wake of the massive financial meltdown of October 2008 and the rampant greed that has come to define our society, can there be any more relevant book to 21st century Americans than The Great Gatsby? Talk about a man ahead of his time: Fitzgerald exposes in this remarkable work the great myth of the American Dream: its tantalizing allure, its pathological fixation on power, social status, wealth and unbridled acquisition, its fundamental emptiness and grotesque unreality."
694,Hawraa Naqi,"The language was extremely beautiful, and the story was good too, i read it in my leisure time, it was not for school yet i found myself high lighting some sentences, and memorizing some lines."
695,Jackie,"First I like to say that this is my first time reading this classic. I think I am one of the few people that never had to read this book in high school. I am glad I read this book now versus being younger and reading it. I know that I would not have gotten the meaning of this book back then. I loved The Great Gatsby. I am not going to go into the plot or what really happens. I will say that everyone needs to read this book once in their life. Or if you really liked it like I did, twice. This book is filled extravagance, infidelity, jazz, large parties, lots of whiskey drinking, murder, love, tribulation, and prosperity. I have to quote one of my favorite passages from The Great Gatsby, “That’s my Middle West-not the wheat or the parties or the lost Swede towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family’s name. I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all-Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly inadaptable to Eastern life”.I am looking forward to seeing the movie now and can see Leonardo DiCaprio playing Gatsby. "
696,Angela Joseph,"I do not how in the world,did I miss such a wonderful book.It is a beautiful tragedy successful in engaging its reader even though most of its characters are obnoxious snobs. The debauchery and corruption pervasive during the roaring twenties are very well captured in the novel.Tom Buchanan comes across as a typical racist supremacist who is worried that if they did not act upon it, there would come a time where there would be white marrying the black. He also reflects the bigotry of a misogynist man of a highly patriarchal society who had a series of mistresses but could not stand by ,in his own words, he cannot sit back and see a nobody from nowhere make love to is wife while as the reader I snickered and thought that that's exactly he was doing to Wilson's wife. As for Daisy, she manages to betray the man who loved her blindly and with devotion which drove him to achieve everything he did. And Gatsby, was he really great? My verdict is that he was.He truly was. A man of such devotion and commitment to the love of his life, continued pursuing his incorruptible dream of winning her back. The only accusation I would make upon him would be that he allowed his blind love towards Daisy to overwhelm his own judgement. This line from the book puts it across eloquently.""Gatsby turned out all right in the end,it was what prayed on Gatsby ,what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams""....It is a beautiful book, a story of love, the American dream, and a lesson that even Great people (Gatsby here) end up failing as a result of chasing a unworthy dream.(winning Daisy back)"
697,Cristina Martinez Cerezo,"¡¡Buenas!!Debo decir, que salvo por Gatsby, Jordan y Nick, los demás los he odiado.La ambientación en esa época me ha enamorado. Sinceramente, parecía que estuviera allí mismo.La historia refleja, cómo los ricos pueden tener muchos dinero, pero estar vacíos dentro.La historia de amor entre Batsby y Daisy...bueno, en mi opinión, el que está verdaderamente enamorado es Gatsby, Daisy es solo una niña pija, que lo que tiene de tonta y guapa la convierte en mala. Y Tom...nunca creí que me vería leyendo un libro en el que un personaje así aparecería.De todas formas, la trama, la narrativa del escritor, y la ""grandeza"" de Gatsby hacen que se salve de una forma que nadie sabrá hasta que no se lo lea.¿Puedo hablar de Gatsby?¿Puedo? Muy bien, hablaré de él. Su historia, su encanto, su inteligencia y su extraordinaria personalidad no solo salva la lectura de los demás personajes, sino que hace que te enamores del él y quieras saber más. Estoy deseando ver la nueva adaptación en la que aparece Leonardo DiCaprio, que, en mi opinión, físicamente me lo he imaginado igual, y el aspecto de los demás personajes también. Estoy segura de que será una buena adaptación.¡¡Byeeeee!!“So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”Reseña del blog:http://thesoulofbookscmc.blogspot.com..."
698,Martin,"This is definitely a book that is meant to be re-read.I loved this novel because for all it's depiction of decadence and debauchery, it's very much real and raw and honest. The characters feel themselves part of a fantasy world but when confronted with their reality and the obvious finality of it all, their masks fall apart, because they've forgotten how to function in honesty, real life doesn't apply to them in most situations, so why should death, suffering and despair apply to them. They live a dream and some of them awaken, but mostly they convince themselves to keep on dreaming and that's the saddest part of it all: most people would do the same, when faced with a chance at truth, they will choose the fantasy. And that's why this is a tragedy.Much a novel of it's time, it's fantastic in it's depiction of humanity (in it's darkest, most superficial form), the writing is evocative, simple and beautifully poignant at the same time.It's just obvious why it's considered the great american novel, it feels like western civilizations' polarizations turned to ink."
699,Emily Evans," I found myself wanting to read this book because I had seen the movie and absolutely loved everything about it. I'm glad I did because I ended up loving the book just as much as I did the movie. I don't regret watching the movie first because as I read the book I was able to attach faces to names and it made it a lot more enjoyable. Something that I ended up finding really interesting is the romance between Nick and Jordan, which is something that the movie didn't depict. I liked how they were so different and came from to very different places, Nick just beginning his work on Wallstreet and Jordan being a famous golfer. It added a nice touch of what was almost a romance besides the twisted love story of Gatsby, and Daisy and Daisy and Tom. At the beginning of the book I liked Daisy, as most would, but by the end I realized I didn't like her at all. To me, it seemed like she was more a problem than Gatsby was. A lot could have been resolved, maybe, if she would have just stayed faithful to Tom Buchanan. Throughout this book there were so many great symbols. The one that probably interested me the most was the billboard of the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg. As I was reading the book, I noticed that a lot of the time when the eyes were mentioned, so was Myrtle. For example the first time that they were mentioned it was said ""The locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind. Over the ash heaps the giants eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away."" Also, when Myrtle was killed by Daisy, the eyes were mentioned once again. Overall, I would definitely read this book again. Sometimes this book is deemed as boring just because some people are required to read it in high school, but anyone that has read it can vouch that it is not."
700,Rebecca Timberlake,"I read this book for the first time in the eleventh grade. Yes, I was that kid that actually read the books assigned in English class. I would plow through any book the teacher gave us, eager to write an essay and debate it for a test. It's who I was all throughout school. But The Great Gatsby was more than that. So much more.I remember it was assigned over a weekend. Maybe a long weekend? Anyway, by Monday I had finished it while all of my classmates were still looking for spark notes on chapter one. I seldom say this, but I devoured this book. I read the first sentence, and was hooked. I really can't emphasis it enough- this story hit me, took me in, and never let me go. For that reason, I've never been able to really express why I love it. I still can't, if I'm being honest. But I at least wanted to put some thoughts down on it. I re-read it every year, sometimes for classes, but mostly for fun. I always get something new from it. I think it helps to focus on a different character each read, or maybe a different theme. But honestly, you could read it without a particular focus and still get so much from it. Even knowing the end so well, I still find myself moved when I finish it. It stays with me hours later; it keeps me from reading other books for a while. I love Jordan and Gatsby, I love the hypocrisy of Nick, I love the shallowness of Daisy. I can't speak for this being one of the best novels of it's time. I can't say that it's certainly the Great American Novel everyone claims it is. But I can say that to me, this book is significant. These characters are so heavily flawed, they care so much about all the wrong things, and the second they try to go after something they might really want, they're reminded that they are supposed to be shallow and greedy. It's something that definitely still occurs today. I could sit here all night and most of tomorrow analyzing all the characters in a million different ways, but I won't. I do think that that is one of the many reasons this story endures; why so many love it. It's a story that can be read in so many ways, depending on who is reading it and when they read it. I could just gush and gush and gush about The Great Gatsby and NEVER hit on half of the reasons it means the world to me. But I just wanted to try- I wanted to say something for it. Maybe one day I'll be able to say everything I need to about it, but for now, this will have to do. "
701,Eli Frankel,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a story about New York in the booming twenties. Fitzgerald describes a man named Nick, and his efforts to become rich living in Long Island. Nick's neighbor is a rather peculiar and mysterious man named Gatsby, whose riches are seemingly infinite. Nick becomes one of Gatsby's friends, and enjoys his parties with flowing liquor. As Nick becomes closer to Gatsby he learns of Gatsby's love for Nick's Sister in law named Daisy. Gatsby gets Nick to set him up with Daisy, but all does not go as planned. Daisy's Husband finds out that Daisy saw Gatsby and gets mad at Gatsby. In the meantime Daisy's husband, Tom, is also cheating on Daisy. After a trip to the City Gatsby accidentally runs over the woman Tom is seeing, and the woman's husband comes to kill Gatsby. After Gatsby is killed, Daisy and Tom move to Chicago, and Nick is left alone in New York.Fitzgerald's classic masterpiece has long been worshipped by readers, and after reading The Great Gatsby I understand this worshipping. I would recommend this book to anyone who has the ability to fully understand the hidden themes and messages of this book. The book is captivating, and forces the reader to think about the book, and the symbolism used by Fitzgerald. I enjoyed the book immensely, and would like to read more of Fitzgerald's novels, as I like his complex style of writing."
702,Isabel,"The Great Gatsby is an amazing American novel, about a man named Nick Carraway that is introduced to the breathtaking new world of West Egg. I absolutely loved the book, because it is full of suspicion, and mystery, that is Gatsby. I love how the book was written, and how all of the characters are linked through marriage, family, or neighbors. As a result of that it makes the story feel genuine. That's what made the book ""come to life"" in my mind. One of the perks was that it was a quick read, but in the end I was left wanting to read more. My favorite part of the book was the last paragraph;, it is my favorite quote:""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recess before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter----to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning------- So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.""(180)I love this quote so much because it always leaves me wondering, and it always amazes me in how beautiful it is. F. Scott fitzgerald's writing style is beautiful, and really meaningful. Because of this book it makes me want to read more of his work."
703,Leslie,"Read more at Biblia Abiblia!This is less likely going to be a review and more of a discussion of my thoughts on this book. It’s a classic, a ninety year old one at that, and as such, I don’t feel like it is my place to judge this book’s worth. Like, I’d probably be willing to sell my soul to write words so lyrically, so beautifully, as F. Scott Fitzgerald does in this book. (Of course, This Side of Paradise gives me hope that one day, I too may be able to write beautifully.)First off, the words. Almost as much as I like good stories, I really love good sentences. Words that flow and melt on your tongue like chocolate, words that you can turn over in your mind over and over and over. Words in which you can lay back and luxuriate, not unlike freshly cleaned sheets.At least, that’s what I got from the book. Really pretty words. But there was substance to back it up.This story works on so many levels, and with so many interpretations. My own interpretation is likely not very original, but nevertheless here is what I got from this book:It’s a story about America.That’s pretty general, isn’t it?"
704,Grace Farris,"Grace FarrisB1 English 232 Critically acclaimed author, F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote many great novels in his time, one of them being The Great Gatsby. Written during the jazz age, this novel was meant to bring to light the increased materialism of America. After World War I people had money and new luxuries became affordable. The purpose was not only to entertain the readers with compelling characters and poetic writing, but to also inform the public that owing lots of unimportant things does not make someone wealthy. Fitzgerald conveyed this message by using entertaining personalities and a view on the American dream that was unheard of before. The theme of this book is the evolution of society. Elaborate parties, expensive cars, new fashion styles, and way too much alcohol. With the new era beginning, the old moral values are replaced with scandalous ideas. None of this is said by characters directly, but shown in the attitudes they hold towards certain events. Nick is unfamiliar with the ways of the city night life when he first moves to Long Island and after attending one of Gatsby’s huge parties he gets an up close look at how empty all the upper class, rich folks really are. Gatsby always seems to be unsatisfied with all that he owns because it holds little value to him without his love, Daisy. He holds Daisy to a standard of perfection that she does not possess and when Gatsby finally comprehends this, he becomes outraged. He blames society and the money Tom, Daisy’s husband, can provide for her.  The Great Gatsby is done in a first person narrative; through the eyes of Nick Carraway, he watches his two friends fall back in love after being separated for years. He witnesses all the struggles and hears about the fights that come with their relationship. I connected with Nick whenever he talked about how he felt like he was intruding on a secret affair as Daisy and Gatsby snuck around. “‘You’re acting like a little boy,’ I broke out impatiently. ‘Not only that, but you’re rude. Daisy’s sitting in there all alone’” (Fitzgerald 80). In this quote Nick is pushing Gatsby to talk to Daisy when he becomes scared she will not remember him after so many years apart. I loved everything about this book. The delightful characters and thought-provoking ideas are far from ordinary writing. The roaring twenties is such an interesting time period to read about. It brings an element of modernity with it that, even though this book is a classic people of this century can relate to it. The book confronts problems with love and materialism in a unique way, that I think everyone should read this book. "
705,Olivia S,"In The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald the message is that you can not repeat the past. Nicholas Carraway, who narrates the story, lives at the West Egg of Long Island, New York in the Jazz Age. His neighbor happens to be the multi-millionaire, Jay Gatsby. Gatsby is known for the parties that he holds in his mansion, yet he is very mysterious. Many people that go (they aren't necessarily invited) to his parties never even see his face. Nobody knows his back story, but Nick wants to find out. Gatsby is also in love with the gorgeous Daisy Buchanan, who is Nick's cousin. Daisy is now married and isn't aware that Gatsby is alive, do to him being in the army when they knew each other. When this is called to Gatsby's attention, he contacts Nick immediately in hopes Nick will help the two reunite and rekindle their love. I tremendously enjoyed reading this book. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses so much symbolism that it's honestly baffling. He uses many a symbols. In one scene Nick sees Jay Gatsby staring at a green light. Nick narrates, ""...he stretched his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward-and distinguished nothing except a single green light...""(20-21). This light is at the end of Daisy's dock. This light represents the hope that Gatsby has for reuniting with Daisy. So far, that is the only connection he has with her. He prays that in the future they will meet again. Fitzgerald also uses motifs. The weather happens to always match the mood of the story. The afternoon that Gatsby and Daisy are too reunite, it is pouring rain. This portrays the stiffness and awkwardness of the situation at the beginning of their reunion. However, as soon as the two start to rekindle their love, the sun is just starting to come out. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone. This book is the definition of a page turner and it was so delightful to read such an amazing piece of literature. I would rate this book a 10 out of 10. "
706,Giselle Estrada,"Out of all the novels I’ve read, I’m glad to say I found one that was entirely worth the read and purchase. F. Scott Fitzgerald’s third book, The Great Gatsby, was a wonderfully composed piece of literature that I’ll surely remember years from now. I’m not exaggerating when I say that this is one of the greatest novels I’ve ever come to read. F. Scott Fitzgerald’s form of writing is truly something else, unique in the best way possible. I don’t think anyone would consider this literary piece a waste of time. It takes place in West Egg, Long Island in the 1920s (sometime after 1922 to be precise). The story itself is told by Jay Gatsby’s neighbor Nick Carraway who is a graduate from Yale. The two grew closer than I’ve found neighbors to be and soon enough found themselves tangled in a web of complications with Tom and Daisy Buchanan, a.k.a. Nick Carraway’s cousin. The story is mainly about Gatsby, who turns out to be kind of a fraud, and his on-going love for Daisy. The amount of history and connections between Gatsby and Daisy is surely enough to get you emotionally attached to the book. Enjoy love through Gatsby’s perspective. From the first of Gatsby’s parties, which you practically felt that you were in due to Fitzgerald’s amazing descriptions, to the scorching day where tragedy occurs in the city, this book is filled with plentiful amounts of surprises. Gatsby meeting up with Daisy was odd and uncomfortable with Nick in the room. Daisy running over and instantly killing Myrtle was definitely unexpected. The blame that Gatsby takes for love is one of the most shocking of all, but only because it led to his death. You’ll be so engrossed in this book that you’ll be anticipating every single one and it won’t even compare to your expectations. This book contains everything you can’t find in the movies and surely enough, you won’t be able to put this book down no matter how hard you find yourself trying. 		In all honesty, I would recommend this book to anyone who hasn’t read it because they’re missing out on something incredible. This book is like a drug to me, it’s addicting and at the end of it all, you can only wish for more. It’s well written, the characters are vibrant and practically alive. The way they speak is thoroughly described to the point where you could almost hear it in your head. Without seeing the movie, I feel as if I’m in it. F. Scott Fitzgerald didn’t miss a single detail and in my opinion, that’s something a novel would be nothing without. There’s no general audience for this novel because I never find myself picking out these kind of books but I certainly enjoyed it. So if you like a little romance in your story, never ending complications that’d you’d find in soap operas, or neither of those things, I still think this book suits you. "
707,Jay,"The book was beautiful. It was wonderfully descriptive and pieced together like poetry. It really represents the jazz age and leaves you disillusioned with it on a whole. All the characters had flaws and were broken and beautiful in their own way. I found myself feeling sad in the end. Especially for Gatsby. It shows how much people really didn't care for him. They didn't know him. They only knew his money. It shows how people and dreams change. How life is never really as you think it will be. It really represents that whole time period in America. It's tragically beautiful. And sadder then how most people look at it. The scandal and fights. I found myself loving Jay Gatsby and then having my heart broken not because he died, but because no one cared except Nick. No one wen to his funeral and he was barely remember.On the character Daisy:I feel i have a more different opinion on her. I have heard a lot of people criticize Daisy for being a dumb character; “a bauble of a woman” I think one review called her when the movie came out this summer. And I’ve always felt confused when people say that, because I never thought Daisy was stupid. Vain, selfish, and indecisive, yes, but never stupid, and a lot of my reasoning for that belief came from this line . “I hope she’ll be a fool,” she says, because she is NOT a fool. Daisy sees the world for what it is (which is something Gatsby could never do, by the way) and that’s why everything is so hard for her. She understands what are actually the themes of the novel: that sometimes your dreams die and that those things you value are actually not valuable. That’s what she learned after Gatsby left and she entered a loveless marriage with a horrible man, which is a difficult thing to experience even if you are an idiot. But she never wants anyone to have to experience those things the way she’s experienced them, or to learn what she believed was the horrible truth of 1920s America; she’d much rather pretend that everything was okay, so that’s exactly what she does. She just pretends. Daisy is a lot of things, but a fool is not one of them.I also feel like all the characters have a deeper part to them that you can look into especially Gatsby. I even loved the strange, unromantic, and sad relationship between Nick and Mrs. Baker.Finally a hilarious comic about the great gatsby that i think really shows what it's about.http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php..."
708,Nikola,"Having decided to flip through its pages a second time, I feel like I'm able to read it better -- meaning that it's not just a story now, but a message as well. The story itself just breaks my heart, and I don't know why I subjected myself to more heartbreak at the hands of a perfectly crafted book for a second time, but I did and now I'm here to share my review.Daisy Buchanan, to me, reminds me of a butterfly fluttering from flower to flower with now grasp at the consequences of leaving one of the flowers behind to never get its nectar again. (The flowers representing the men in her life.) Due to her money, I feel like she gets bored and must find something to liven up her life again with no care of who she injures or affects negatively. She's very fleeting and fickle, and I don't think she ever was worthy of deserving Gatsby.With that being said, to me, the book is about the fickleness of life and the people in it. It's about finding friends that will stand by you til the very end and a warning to those who haven't found them yet. Daisy represents those who you shouldn't keep close, and Nick represents those you should. Even Tom Buchanan was fickle in having a mistress to fulfill his boredom, who he forgot about with the drop of a hat. Everyone in the book was using everyone else for something -- the party goers at Gatsby's for fun, Daisy marrying Tom for a sense of stability and wealth, Tom having an affair with Myrtle, even Wolfsheim using Gatsby as a business partner for money -- despite saying ""I made Gatsby"", he didn't even bother going to his funeral.It's really a tragic but breathtaking story with excellent narrative and imagery. The words uses were positively gorgeous, and I could stare at the paragraphs for hours just taking in the wonderfully phrased words.I now see why The Great Gatsby is a classic, and I really wish Fitzgerald had lived long enough to see his dream of it being influential come true. "
709,Jan,"Of course a masgnificent book. I think this was the 3d time I've read it - but for all I remembered, it might well have been the first. So now I hope the plot will stay fixed in my mind, the language lyrical and ominous, all at the same time. Nick Carraway moving among the characters effortlessly, his suspension of judgment making him a chameleon, allowing the shifting forms each character assumes to move fluidly through to the end of the book. The things that had stayed with me from my previous readings were the vapidity of Daisy and the tragedy of Gatsby, the apparent timelessness of the American yearning for wealth beyond imagining, and its illusory value."
710,Andrew Barger," F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald**Spoiler Alert**This is the second time I have read The Great Gatsby and it will likely not be the last. The first was for the extreme pleasure that the novel yields and this most recent time was to study how Fitzgerald did it. As a writer I am constantly peeking behind the literary curtain of others writers to see how they did it; how they pulled off the fictional magic trick. In this instance it was to see how Fitzgerald levitated Daisy through this Jazz Age classic novel.To me, Daisy is the most interesting character in TGG and the most damning. She is infinitely complex and impossible to nail down just like the varied guests that float in and out of Gatsby's parties. Daisy drifts through rooms and people's lives as she does life. It's not a stretch to realize that Fitzgerald based her on his wife Zelda who he called ""the first American flapper."" Both Daisy and Zelda were from Southern states: Kentucky and Alabama, respectively. They were unrestrained and had a thirst for living a wealthy lifestyle. For Gatsby, he was driven to bootlegging in an effort to quench this insatiable desire by Daisy. Fitzgerald took to writing novels, which after a number of years of writing them myself I can tell you of their many similarities. The difference between writing novels and bootlegging is that one can get you thrown in jail, cause you to drink heavily, and make you become associated with criminals. The other is bootlegging.It's easy to imagine Zelda and F. Scott flying down some New York back road in their coupe, off to partying another Jazz Age night away. Easy indeed. Fitzgerald can, after all, write a party scene like no one else in the literature. He had lots of practice in his life. In TGG the party scenes never stop, each one is bigger than the last; each gala trying to outdo the other. Still, Fitzgerald wrote even better ones in his short story collection Flappers and Philosophers that is not to be missed.TGG is unsurpassed in capturing the Jazz Age, one of the most wild and reckless (and fun!) periods in American history. It could only have been captured in the way that it was in TGG by a great artist who had lived it in spades. In my view Gatsby is one of the most sympathetic characters in literature. Why is he vilified? He was just a guy, like millions before and after him, trying to impress his girl. He wanted her unconditional love and never got it. Ultimately she got him killed. Daisy. The one who was guilty of vehicular homicide and love suicide. Daisy. The one Fitzgerald magically levitated like the Zelda of his own life. "
711,Bailey Hopkins,"I thought this was one of the best books I have read in a while. Firzgerald is a true artist and the Great Gatsby was his canvas. The novel was good all the way from describing Gatsby extravagant parties that was simply a part of the roaring 20's lifestyle, showing the complicated relationship between Gatsby, Daisy, and Tom, or even just giving us the universals message of how we can't go back to the past no matter how hard we try—yet we kkep trying to grasp that ""green light."" All-in-all I would highly recommend the novel. "
712,IsabellaTheBookaholic,Just... outstanding
713,Michael Bedford,"I just finished reading The Great Gatsby. I must admit a certain hipsteritis here. I read most of the novel when I was in high school but was driven away by the less than likeable cast of characters. Since I'd never finished reading this great American classic I decided, when the new movie was released, that I would quickly read it after Cait was finished with it. Clocking in at a very manageable 140 or so pages and only 76,000 words, according to the foreword, it didn't represent too great a time commitment, I chastised my teenage identity again.Reading the novel now I can understand why it's such a classic. Aside from the romantic obsession people have with the '20s - the fashion, the dancing, the lifestyle - the characterization of these snobbish loafers is expertly done. What turned me off of it then, of course, was just as noticeable this time around. Fitzgerald walked a thin wire in writing a novel with no obvious protagonist, and, with no obviously virtuous character to be found. So, instead of working as a narrative about interesting people who do interesting things, the novel is about awful/mediocre people who do awful/mediocre things. The draw of the novel is its unabashed ""telling it like it is"", people are jerks and no one really cares about anyone.So, in a certain way, this novel sets itself up as an antithesis to the romantic idea people have of '20s USA. Sure, it was a lot of fun for some folks but others didn't have it so well...also people were just as mean and selfish then as they are now. I think it's interesting that this novel has achieved the heights of popularity it has. Much like The Catcher in the Rye, The Great Gatsby simultaneously turns on and pokes fun at the misanthrope in all of us.I'd say if you watched any of the movies they made out of this novel, you owe it to yourself to read it. It's a quick one, and intriguing. Sure, the ending will be spoiled for you if you've seen them, but the succinct richness of Fitzgerald's writing likely can't be truly captured by any film director. If you've never seen any of the movies, read it anyway. Just be ready for a thematically-driven novel and not a character-driven one."
714,Anna Yao,"I learned a few important life lessons from reading the Great Gatsby. I learned that wealth cannot buy love, and that some things (or people) are better off living in our past. A moment may last a few seconds, but it will last in our memories for as long as we let it. In that time, the moment will be repeatedly refined and decorated by our minds. And if we ever relive the moment, it will fall short of the colossal expectations we have placed upon it with our imagination and leave behind nothing but mere disappointment.The Great Gatsby is a wonderful novel. Defs recommend!"
715,Johnplavelle,"I always loved the style of this book. The scenes have life to them. The winds and the heat and the objects in a room have movement and a deeper design to the people who are in them. I really got a stronger sense of how F.Scott related to the landed gentry and the filthy rich when I visited his boyhood home in St. Paul. A really nice neighborhood on rise over the city below, But it was upper middle class except for the rail tycoons mansion on the very edge of the ridge. He had to pass by that huge brown stone monstrosity daily, with all of the servants quarters and huge windows. On the same block he lived on, but a million miles away. Today we are troubled by a recession that was created from greed of wealthy individual, who have managed to remain wealthy in spite of the economy, while others have lost so much. There is a difference in the morality of people based upon their backgrounds and their status in life. F. Scott saw this from his earliest days in St. Paul. He left there for an ivy league education where he surely came face to face with it there. He was the mid-westerner living among the elite of the east."
716,Tamra,"I first read this book in 1997, as a High School junior. And I hated it. I didn't get it, I hated the colors, etc. There was just no good about this book.My brother re-read it as an adult and loved it, so he told me to read it. I deeply objected, but read it anyway, and shockingly I LOVED it! It's amazing! By page 10 I was hooked and I read the whole book in under 24 hours, including the lengthy preface and ending notes that my version contained.Fitzgerald can write, no doubt about it. He describes things and you SEE it, you are in the scene yourself. In the first chapter he describes curtains in a way that made me want to buy those curtains--it was lovely. IT WAS CURTAINS!! The man is good.Had some of the same issues with the plot line (why must I fall in love with Daisy only to find out, in the end, that she's a scum bag?), but it's a GENIUS plot line. At once beautiful and tragic, and capturing so much of the American spirit. I can identify myself lost somewhere in the plot line, somewhere in the incorruptible dreams that were corrupt the whole time.Still am not sure what all the colors mean, but I became okay with the green light. I liked the imagery and what he said it stood for. And that leaves me with a question:Would they have still hit and killed Myrtle if they'd been driving the BLUE car?"
717,Cooper Sakaguchi,"Cooper Sakaguchi 	The Great Gatsby is a book about a somewhat mysterious man who is so immensely in love with a girl that he would do anything for her; this eventually costs him. This man’s name is James Gatz, or as everyone else knows him, Jay Gatsby. The narrator is Gatsby’s close friend, Nick Carraway, and the book takes place in New York in the 1920s. F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel, The Great Gatsby, is full of mystery, secrets, romance, and suspense. 	Personally, I think The Great Gatsby is a very good book because it is interesting and fun to read, but also teaches many lessons indirectly throughout the book. The biggest lesson that I can think of in this book is to not let the feelings for a very special person overwhelm you, and cause you to do something wrong. Gatsby takes the blame for a girl he loves, Daisy, after she commits a very serious crime, and is murdered for it. Fitzgerald displays this through the quote, “He was clutching at some last hope and I couldn’t bear to shake him free,” (Fitzgerald 148). This hope was Daisy, and how he couldn’t leave her to cover himself up. Then, when Nick finds Gatsby, dead, he notices, “The gardener saw Wilson’s body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete,” (162). Fitzgerald uses the term holocaust because of the horrible mistake of manslaughter that occurred. This lesson shows people to be honest and not do something that you will regret. 	Also, I enjoyed how classy Jay Gatsby was. Gatsby grew up very poor and joined the military, where he learned his manners. Then he attended Oxford for 5 months, and met his inspiration on a journey, Dan Cody. To get Daisy’s attention, he tried all he could by, “So he made the most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously,” (149). He learned how to talk, how to dress, and how to be elegant from this millionaire, and Gatsby makes references about him all of the time. Then, Gatsby became rich through bond trading, and was able to put these traits to action. Gatsby was almost always dressed in a suit, which I could just picture as I read the book; an elegant man dressed in suits in New York City. 	One thing that I felt could have been better in the book was the description. With all of the extravagance on Mr. Jay Gatsby, it could have been a 500-paged book, but it was around 200 pages. The extraordinary parties and the mystery of Gatsby could have been more thoroughly explained as well. However, the book did use strong adjectives to describe certain events and they were explained well. 	The Great Gatsby was an overall very good book and I recommend it to people who like mystery and suspense. Though it does not contain as much description as some would like, it teaches many important lessons throughout, and is a fun fictional book. If I had to rate this book, I would rate it 9/10 stars. "
718,Matt Morgan,Now I see what all the fuss is about.
719,Kirby,"The last time I read this, I was 16 and recall thinking it was good. To anyone else who just read Gatsby in high school, I would highly suggest a re-read as a fully formed adult. Ah, the tragedy of the fervent but unfulfilled dream... it hits way closer to home when you're 30 than when you're a teenager, for sure. Hurts so good! Another great book about life disappointment to add to my favorites list!"
720,Jordan Gadapee,After reading Atlas Shrugged I had the urge to re-read The Great Gatsby. I'm finding that I appreciate the writing/writer more than I recall doing in high-school.
721,Joseph Mamoala,"The Great Gatsby was a Great Book. I had previously read it in middle school, and reading it again only allowed me to read further into the text and Fitzgerald's indications on an aspiring bootlegger in the early 20th century. One take I had from the book was that there are many different types of people. I understand that not everyone can be the same, and it is reasonable that people will acting different according to their background. From Tom being a big-headed polo player to Gatsby being a shifty dreamer because of the people he was raised by. Also, anything can be an illusion. Obviously, things can never truly return to the way they were, and people always change. Nothing can ever stay perfect. Gatsby tried to keep a golden impression on the outside, but really he was a liar and a fraud. There is a lot to learn from in this novel, so I will place Fitzgerald among the pantheon of literary geniuses."
722,Bryant Frazer,"Hey guys you should all read this book it's really good. Short but sweet, its language drenched in vernacular yet studded with glittering gems, The Great Gatsby is a book-length meditation on love, loss, yearning and regret.Fitzgerald draws these characters in broad strokes, offering just enough precision to define their general form before giving them over to the reader's imagination. And the narrative is simply but solidly constructed, its handful of carefully drawn passages pushing the story forward, pivoting at midpoint on the tantalizing resumption of a never-fulfilled love affair, and teasing out the mystery behind self-made man Jay Gatsby as it descends into tragedy. (Interestingly enough at this moment in pop culture, Gatsby's backstory has parallels with that of Mad Men's Dick Whitman and his more familiar stolen identity, Don Draper.)Those paragraphs and pages where the narrator's subjective voice takes over and Fitzgerald's prose turns its most evocative and poetic are splendid; as final passages in classic English-language literature go, I think I prefer Joyce's ""The Dead,"" if just barely.But what I really love about Gatsby is its systematic dismantling of nostalgia -- the malady underpinning so much of American culture, commerce and politics revealed finally as a fatal flaw of character."
723,Lisa Williams,Probably the fourth time I've read this and I still love it
724,Christie Archer,"1.I decided to read this because I need a classic and I thought that I would be really interested in this one for the pure fact the it had such great reviews. 2. My favourite character is Jay Gatsby because he believed that you could never give up on true love and you would do anything possible for the one you even though that meant sacrificing himself. I appreciated the detail of the extravagant parties he threw. I really liked how he changed everything that people saw in him so he could be near the one he loved.3.“The loneliest moment in someone’s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.” This quote is so touching and sometime when I'm feeling really i just think of it and it makes me feel just that much better about myself and the situation that I have most likely been thrown into. It just outlines perfectly that feeling you have when sadness takes over and you know what's happening but you can't do anything.4.This novel made me think more deeply about the way I see the world. Also that there is always hope even if you are in a situation that makes it hard or difficult to see the right path. It also made me think about the fact of just how willing we are as people to change ourselves to fit those we love and truly care about."
725,Whitney,"4/15: Yes. Still love this one. Still love teaching this one. One of my students this year said Fitzgerald is a poet, and she is right. This year we also focused more on the structure of the novel, and that adds so much to the understanding of purpose. So many kids were so disillusioned with Gatsby, and I loved that. Can't wait to teach it again next year. 5/12: Once again, I LOVE this book! Beautifully written. Powerful story. Great lessons on the decline and fall of morality related to the American Dream. Love. Love. Love. 5/13: Again. . .I can't get enough of this one. It is truly an American Literary Masterpiece. Fabulous read. Insightful. Thoughtful. Art. Love it!5/14: Loved it yet again! Such a great read. I also have so enjoyed teaching it to my students. I learn something new every single time I read it. Next to Mockingbird, this is one of my all time favorites. . .The suspense, cheating, lying, stealing, and affairs make it a 1920s soap opera with some class. "
726,Isabel Casillas," F.Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby illustrated the power of betrayal, love, lies, the rich and poor. ""Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, just remember that all the people in the world haven't had the advantages that you've had"" was my favorite quote that made me know right away that this was the book i wanted to read. The book has many themes. The lesson i would say about this book would probably be that you'll always get caught no matter what never get too comfortable with your actions. The story is told by a young man that was taught to know what was right and wrong. His name was nick that had came from fighting in the WW1 and moved down to west egg an island of the newly rich. Nick tells throughout the story how he finds out his mysterious neighbor named Jay Gatsby appeared to be. Nick discovers the symbol of love and lies that gatsby appeared to show during the movie. Gatsby was a man that was in deep love with nick's cousin daisy. Daisy and gatsby were in love but when gatsby went to war she got tired of waiting and married a rich man that gave her everything named Tom. Other than Gatsby being a liar about his life, Tom was also. Tom was creating on daisy with a woman named Myrtle Wilson which was married to George Wilson, but tom was selfish and didn't want Gatsby to have daisy. Which causes a huge disaster. But Nick in the other hand falls in love with Daisy friend named jordan baker. Nick tells us the whole truth about Gatsby and to picture every little scene in your head is just great. The fact that Fitzgerald put this story together is perfect because it does compare to real lives out there. The feelings, the thoughts, the love, the lies, the craziness, the accidents, everything! And i really liked it. Overall the story The Great Gatsby was ""great"". I would recommend my friends and family to read and watch the movie. "
727, Sikhandi (Teresa),It was a great book . I loved the writing and the characters although i thought it came to too much of a tragic end . I thought Gatsby didn't deserve to die .. 
728,Grace,"Excellent book. Excellently written. It gives you the true insight into what upper-class Americans living in NEW York were like. An accurate (in my opinion) choice of narrator. It’s short but the characters are developed well enough for you to understand why they carry out their actions. There are ‘villains’ in this story but it is left to you to make that decision. Written by a man (Fitzgerald) who craved the indulgencies of an upper-middle class life style he definitely is very self-aware, through the characters he creates about the types of personalities that were amongst this social class. Nevertheless lying beneath the surface is a story of love, hope, conspiracy and a type of deception known to many of us. Despite The Great Gatsby being a somewhat short novella, it contains everything needed for us to be able to understand and engage with every character. This is definitely one of my favourite books. It’s an excellent piece of writing which incorporates both elements of fiction and non-fiction."
729,RJ,"I am not sure how I escaped high school and college (as an English lit major no less) without reading this novel or any Fitzgerald, but alas I had not read it till now. Not going to lie the new Baz Lurhman movie prompted me to read it before I saw the film and I cannot believe that's what it took. This book was amazing. I fell in love with Fitzgerald's writing style and this story of the great Jay Gatsby. It's interesting that so much character could be contained in quite a short novel. But I think that is part of the wonder and endurance of the book. Nick Carraway is one of my favorite narrators of all time. He seems to be the only character grounded in at least some reality that I as a reader could relate. I was a little disappointed with the movie on this aspect because I felt like the preface of Nick being in a psychiatric ward damaged that part of his character. Other than that I did like the movie and appreciated the way they they handled Daisy's demeanor. I have already picked my next Fitzgerald novel and look forward to more of his stories! "
730,Ántonia,"The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a thrilling tale, that carries a lot of drama in a small package. It begins with Nick Caraway, the protagonist and follows him over the course of a summer in the Hamptons. Between reconnecting with his cousin, Daisy and her husband Tom, Nick's summer starts off with a bang. He soon learns that his neighbor, a Mr. Gatsby, is extraordinarily wealthy and throws lavish parties every weekend, though no one knows why and few have seen him. As Nick's relationship with Mr. Gatsby unfolds, he learns more about his past, a heart breaking romance, and how it involves Nick. He's soon sucked into the magnificent world of the Great Gatsby. This book is fantastic because it's precise and short making it fun and easy to read. Though the plot can be complicated at times, it's never boring and can easily be read over a weekend. I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't mind that the book is so short, leaving little explanation for somethings and at times cant go into as much detail as some would wish. "
731,Collin Morgan,"Embitterment	In the Great Gatsby by Francis Fitzgerald, Nick Carraway is presented as the narrator with a natural curiosity and a scrupulous eye. His nature is complicated by the notion that he is unbiased and reserves judgement as a result of his father’s guidance while he was growing up. A relatively prosperous individual, he strays on the edge of wealth and normalcy. Nick stands in stark contrast with the circle of people he associates with, them being wealthy and grandiose and proper, him being shrewd and polite, yet analytical. He changes, however, throughout the course of the novel, perhaps conveying a message about wealth and the way it is obtained. Nick became disenfranchised after experiencing an inside look of the rich lifestyle of the individuals with the so-called “old money”, and became bitter after understanding the irresponsible nature of those with wealth. 	The way money is earned is a persisting idea throughout the novel, and it demostrates a common idea. Those who inherit money have a tendency to be pompous, overbearing, dominating individuals. This is demonstrated through the character of Tom frequently. For example, the instance where Tom bullies a middle class mechanic named Wilson by leading him on with a business proposition he never intends to fulfill illustrates his desire to flaunt his wealth. He hangs a car deal over Wilson to portray his dominance, and the fact that he had been cheating with his wife furthers the dominant power play shown by Tom. His affluence plays a large role in his overbearing disposition, as well as the way he came into it. Tom inherited his wealth, and this is the root cause of much of his delusion of superiority. On the other hand is Gatsby, a made man whose wealth was acquired through business, after coming from nothing. Gatsby is similar to Tom in the sense that they are both materialistic, however Gatsby’s character is much more considerate, decent, and generous than Tom’s. Gatsby’s character, although questionable to some extent due to his illegal activities, comes off as easygoing and polite, and easy to get to know.Nick sees this in the way that they conduct themselves. Gatsby throws large, inviting parties, while Tom prefers to have exclusive sit downs and the like. Gatsby tends to be warm to most who he meets, Tom is standoffish. In these respects, inherited money or “old money” seems to dictate the lifestyle and character of those with it. Nick speaks with disdain for some of these phenomenons illustrating his diminishing amount of respect for those with the “old money” economic standing.	Nick experiences many moments when he realizes the false nature of those in the circle of his friends and acquaintances. For example, his cousin Daisy is often the subject of scrutiny, and for good reason. She seems to thrive on attention and loves the thrill and drama of being wealthy. That is why, after all, she married Tom. Nick sees through her facade multiple times, and it is even pointed out to him by Gatsby when he describes her voice’s source of importance when he says, “‘Her voice is full of money,” (pg 120). The egotistical aura that the wealthy hold is obvious to all, not just Nick. Even Jordan Baker, Nick’s love interest, is subject to his scorn. After the theatrics of a long summer day in a hotel, Nick narrates, “I’d had enough of all them for one day, and suddenly that included Jordan too,”(pg 142). The fact that he was fed up with Jordan as well as Tom and Daisy shows the severity of his revelation. He realized that they were shallow, over dramatic, and petty. The wealth he once had a respect for is shown to be detrimental to those who have it. The ultimate instance of his disgust with “old money” occurs when he sees Tom on the street after a traumatic affair with Gatsby that his circle of companions witnessed. Nick reflects, “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy-they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness...”(pg 179). He then equates Tom to a child, and ridicules him and Daisy for their cowardice in the way that they deal with the harm they have caused people. This is the climax of Nick’s awakening to the fact that this lifestyle is corrupting, uncompassionate, and ultimately debilitating both emotionally and psychologically. This is the final destination of his change throughout the novel, from a position of ambition in his career, to a bitter and unsatisfying end of his dreams of wealth.	Nick Carraway experienced an altering of the way he approached affluence. He learned that the lifestyle of the rich contains no room for basic human emotion, and grants an immunity to the feeling of remorse for wrongdoing. The events he bore witness to throughout the novel gave him a glimpse of what he did not wish to become. This led to him reflecting bitterly on how events unfolded, and left him wishing he had not experienced the tragedies that had befallen him and those surrounding him. The trauma he suffered as a result of the lack of empathy of Tom ultimately scarred him, but even so, he kept his fondness of Gatsby, a man who had changed his view of the world."
732,Elina Zalkalne,"HNNNNNNNNNGGHHHHH *slams head into the wall repeatedly*Not having read this a gazillion twenty two years and seven months ago is probably one of the greatest regrets I have. At least the film [and my friend - yes Rachel you - going on about it from the second the birds wake up until the dying breaths of the sun touch the horizon] convinced me to add this to my read instantly book shelf. Thank you Rachel.Now I just want to get a 20s hairstyle, restock my wardrobe with flapper dresses and pretty hats and scarves and shoes and learn how to shimmy.I'm so thankful this book edition had a wonderful introduction which brought to my attention linguistic and metaphorical things which would probably have slipped by my attention otherwise, but luckily enhanced the reading experience tenfold. It's unbelievable what an intricate, detailed, murder mystery adultery love triangle social issues political underpinnings counterfeit bonds finance friendship fashion partying, story can be written in a hundred pages. Go Fitzgerald. You rock Fitzgerald.And if despite me just laying bare the entire plot for you and you still don't like the premise, go and read a book in your own comfort zone. Like Twilight. Or My Little Pony. Otherwise, go read it at once if you haven't so far. Like seriously, what are you waiting around for?!?![I'm going to feel so protective about this book - just like TFIOS - that when after the film countless girls are going to start copying the 20s style of dress, hair and speech I'll just curl protectively around the book and hiss at then to go away because I WAS HERE FIRST SHOO]"
733,Kyla,"I must say that I am glad that I gave this book a second chance. I should have learned by now that any opinion I form about books while studying them in school should not be trusted. I had originally given this book 1 star based on my first impression of it when it was assigned in senior year ten years ago. Ten years later I have come to reread it and without an English teacher dissecting and tearing every page apart I have come to appreciate it for what it is on my own terms. When I first read this book I was frustrated with all its characters. I didn't enjoy their shallow existences and felt that I was reading over and over again useless empty conversations as everyone drifted to and from ""town"". Upon revisitation I realized that in high school I was as shallow as them by really only reading the book at face value. This time around I looked deeper (is that possible?) into the characters' lives and appreciated this book much much more. As years have gone by I connected with them more in terms of living with a piece of you in the past. The melancholy Gatsby registered more with me as an adult now than he did when I was a student. Let's chalk it up to more life has been lived since the first time I read this book. In a sad way I find Gatsby's character tragic. He has spent years of his life facing backwards, trying to create a world for himself based on something/someone he has been pining over and instead of living in the now, he spends his life living in the past all the while dreaming and romanticising over what could be if he acheives the unacheivable. The rest of the characters I find tragic in as much as their sole focus in life seems to be keeping up with appearances. Making sure they are seen with the in crowd at the in parties, but none of them have enough balls it seems to really have an original thought and stand out for themselves as individuals. In doing so they all follow one another around like shallow sheep. A notion that translates into real life no matter what the generation. Are we not all sheep (to an extent) that follow the in crowds/people/styles etc. What frustrated me before about this book I enjoyed this time around and finally get why this book is a classic. This review isn't really much of a review, it's just a disjointed blerb from me while trying to get thoughts organized about how I felt about reading it again. "
734,Zack Paganini,"I consider this to be the greatest book I've ever read. Fitzgerald puts forth this incredible American epic; a tragedy, a love story, a condemnation of materialism, and a stunning narration of 1920s America. Many people dislike this book, which is most often read in 10th grade, citing its being boring and being about the problems of rich people. To the first, I would say this book is often not taught correctly. Worksheets focusing on color symbolism miss the forest for the trees. What makes this book incredible is what it says, not the color Fitzgerald uses to say it. As for the second, I must say that people who hold this opinion are simply missing the point. The very thought that Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby in an attempt to make the readers see the suffering of Gatsby, and therefore rich people in general, and feel sorry for their plight is so ridiculous it makes me shudder. Gatsby is no hero, and he cannot be simplified by his tax bracket. Rather, he is a character as complex as what he represents; America as a whole. In portraying a generation that committed despicable acts in the Great War and now struggles with its identity, a generation with wealth that would soon prove to be only an illusion, Fitzgerald creates in Gatsby a character who has allied himself with questionable characters to gain a paper-thin wealth and popularity, which is shown to be a sad illusion at his empty funeral. Yet the condemnation of the generation and of Gatsby is not overly harsh... as a reader I still empathized with Gatsby, who did it all for love. And really, who can truly not find the imagery of a man standing on a dock, reaching his arms out towards a beacon of light which represents the goal he is so committed to, powerful? What cold-hearted person could be unmoved by such an act?This is truly the great American novel."
735,Kyle,"Let's be clear. I did not rate this book 5 stars for any arbitrary, crowd-feeding, idiotic reason. Also not to say that I'm a 'hipster'. I'm merely annoyed at the fact that people assume somebody likes a book for any reason other than the one they present. I am not some pseudo-intellectual who pretends to have some sort of profound insight into the metaphorical or euphemistic aspects of the book. I am merely asserting the reasons why I loved the book, and that's that.This book is seen as the Great American Classic, thrown into every US school curriculum for the sake of being what it is. Previously, I didn't retain any fondness for such typical, dull, 'classic' books. But I have found myself feeling increasingly different about this book, having not actually read it before, nor being made to read it as a part of a curriculum of any variety.In the least pretentious way possible, I found that this book to be more than just some age-old love story. It's more applicable to be called a life story. And not in the sense of a biography or anything similar, but a book that, over 90 years since it was written, still manages to make me question some of the things in my life. It truly deserves to be called a classic if, after so long, it still has the power to do that. To a 15 year old boy. Who practically does nothing with his life but go to school and work. This is different. I'm not looking at the easily identified symbolism such as the green light at the end of the pier, or weather-beaten billboards advertising optometrist services. I see this as one of the greatest juxtapositions of all time. In a lot of the classics, the telling in the novel is from the perspective of the main character. The Great Gatsby sees Nick Carraway the narrator, the next door neighbour to the elegant, wealthy and refined man named Gatsby, who throws exuberant parties. Through this, I think we find out more about Gatsby than we would have had the story been narrated by him. For surely such a reclusive man as Gatsby would keep his feelings close to his heart, and only through identifying his actions can we see the true Gatsby. We see the man who throws parties to gain the attention of the women he fell in love with when he had no money. We see his outsized existence as a mysterious, wealthy man that nobody ever really knew anything about (not completely that is). We find out about Gatsby's transition from what he was to who he is in the novel, his love for Daisy outlasting time, money, and her own marriage. All of this is achieved by the book not having a protagonist; but instead making the book all about Gatsby without bringing Gatsby in to tell his own story. To reserve the life and mystery that he is. That's how people see Gatsby; the mystery, the giant, successful entity that no one really knows. Fitzgerald kept that image alive in the reader as well, to reserve Gatsby as what everyone else believes him to be. Gatsby, if he were the protagonist, would never reveal all of this to us, and only through an objective, but close view of Gatsby, can we see who he truly is. Ultimately, not having Gatsby as the protagonist of the novel revealed a lot more about Gatsby's character than it would have otherwise, as well as maintain the celestial existence of Gatsby on the whole. The book is about Gatsby, not by Gatsby, and it's the perspective of Nick that allows us to see this.People scorn and advocate against this book's status as a classic for it's lifeless, dull, shallow characters and it's boring storyline. For example, what do we know from the bare basis? Gatsby is a liar and con artist, it's implied he's involved in some sort of criminal activity, runs scams and fixed the 1919 World Series. Daisy is a ditzy, flimsy girl with none of her own ambitions, who runs between the people she loves for the sake of nothing better to do with her relatively empty life. So what sentiment should we really find in a story about love between two such equally shallow and superficial characters? I believe that this was attempted and achieved deliberately by Fitzgerald to draw on the things that make the story important. This is a cautionary tale, an ideology that can't be identified until you read into Nick's comment that he is 'one of the few honest people that [he] has ever known'. The cruel, superficial aspects to all the characters in the entire novel is what makes it as important and as relatable as it is. Their dull, lifeless characterisation draws the message of the book to the forefront, as well as reflect realistic characteristics (people in real life are dull, boring, cruel, and superficial, I'm sure you know).In a book full of liars, cheaters and users, you come to expect the same from Gatsby. He is the biggest liar of them all, but Gatsby believes that he is set apart from the others due to his unrelenting love for Daisy. He is dreaming an impossible dream, but is afraid to venture into his life and attempt (in an admittedly roundabout manner) to get what he wants. He is holding onto a hypothetically better version of himself. In a life full of love, lust, wants, and desires, this is something that every single one of us readers has done and will continue to do. We hold onto our dreams in order to disregard the terribleness and emptiness of our own lives, big or small. This is highlighted through lots of the characters' lack of life and flatness. Real life humans are flat and not as well rounded as amazing characters, but still have all these inspirations. The terribleness of the Great Gatsby's characters over exaggerate this ordinariness, allowing readers to relate.And hence we come full circle: not only is this novel a juxtaposition of Nick's life in comparison to Gatsby's (and thus reveal more of Gatsby himself), but it's also a juxtaposition between Gatsby's life and the readers. Both Gatsby's and the readers' stories are glorified editions of a tragic cautionary tale of how things can end if we hold onto an imaginary world where everything is okay. But it also tells us that it's okay to do so. Imagine, dream, and hope for a different life as much as you want. Fitzgerald said it himself: 'Wanting too much will always prove more interesting than not wanting enough'. Yes, the green light at the end of the pier is a spectacular metaphor for this, but I find that that applies to the desire and want of the American Dream specifically, and how it comes to an end when exposed to corruption and violence. This book is more than that.The Great Gatsby is all about how we hold onto the things we desire, for better or for worse. The novel, through its dull characters and storyline, its lack of protagonist, and the mystery of Gatsby, highlights this unintentional feeling of desire we all hold in our own lives. "
736,Mänsomläser,"En så kallad klassiker. Inte så sällan blir jag smått besviken när jag läser dem. “Var det allt?” liksom. I det här fallet blev jag inte besviken.Berättaren Nick Carraway är en börsmäklare som blir granne med den mystiske Jay Gatsby, känd för sina extravaganta fester. Gatsbys förflutna är höljt i dunkel och det förekommer en mängd rykten om hur han har skapat sin kolossala förmögenhet. Carraway blir en av få som kommer honom in på livet och får veta sanningen.Det är en sorglig uppgång-och-fall-historia om en man – en self-made man – som trots enorma framgångar inte lyckats skaka av sig sin ungdoms stora kärlek. Men det är också en roman om den amerikanska drömmen och om den gamla antagonismen mellan gamla och nya pengar. Det är mycket skickligt utfört. En bok som förtjänar epitetet klassiker."
737,Lars Aumueller,"Re-reading this masterpiece for the first time in fifteen years, and at an age when I can truly appreciate the breathtaking skill with which it is written, reminds me of all of the great possibilities in life. One of the few books that every dedicated lover of literature should read."
738,Marlena,"The first time I read ""The Great Gatsby"" was in high school. It was for class and a ""have to"" type thing. This time I chose to read it because I wanted to and loved every minute. There was so much to the book that I did not appreciate as a high school student. I understand why this book is held in such high regard."
739,Candice Hill,"It's a classic for a reason. Too bad they make us read books in highschool that are meaningless then. This book is wonderful and short, and everyone should read it. Also, the movie with Robert Redford follows the book perfectly.Favorite Quotes:pg. 118 ""'What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon?' cried Daisy, 'and the day after that, and the next thirty years?'""pg. 120 ""'She's got an indiscreet voice,"" I remarked. ""It's full of--"" I hesitated. ""Her voice is full of money,"" he said suddenly. That was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money--that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals' song of it....High in a white palace the king's daughter, the golden girl....""pg. 179 ""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up their mess they had made....""pg. 180 ""And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that is was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night. Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther....And one fine morning-------So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
740,Bev Wall,"It's taken me all these years to read this book and I probably wouldn't have read it if it hadn't been for a class I was taking. I liked this book, but it helped immensely to have an open discussion in class about the roaring twenties and how things were in the 1920s. Interesting.June 2013 - I just re-read this book in anticipation of the movie coming out and enjoyed it so much more this second reading. The language was eloquent and full, very detailed and deliberate. I think dialogue played an important part in this novel because it helped the reader learn so much about the characters by what they said instead of what they did. It spelled it out rather simply as far as I am concerned.The main theme was love and while it took some time for Jay Gatsby to bring it to fruition, his love for Daisy ended up being his demise. As I was reading I was wondering if F. Scott Fitzgerald's love for his wife Zelda was the source for this great love that Gatsby felt for Daisy. Although unrequited, Gatsby could not be convinced (and neither could Nick Carraway), that she wouldn't return to him someday. This is a book that I will save forever, will recommend to others, and will probably re-read at some point in my life. If you decide to read it, take your time and savor the words - they are beautiful strung together into eloquent sentences.Jan. 11, 2015 - Just saw the moving. This really changed my perspective on this book. How very sad for Gatsby to be so obsessed with Daisy that he would go to such lengths to acquire wealth in order to gain her love. Obviously, this back-fired on him. But, also, how very sad for Daisy that she was so blinded by money and status that she walked away from her true love without ever looking back. Loved this movie which made me love the book all that much more. I do think the movie helped me to understand some of the stuff that went on in the book that I hadn't understood before."
741,Grantreid,"The Great Gatsby was written during about the 1920s. The purpose of this book was to speak a deep message about American Society. It shows everyone who reads it what life was like in post WWI ""roaring twenties"". This was a time that many argue is one of the greatest in American history. It showed the how hectic life was, especially with the rich people of the 1920's. The novel was very deep in it's self reflective state. The novel was trying to say that America is going crazy and something will happen if nothing changes. It showed the separation of classes roaring twenties America. The rich were getting richer and the poor were struggling to have a good life in real life, as well as the book. Fitzgerald didn't really ""predict"" anything happening in the future, he just said that people should slow down. But something did happen, the stock market crash. This book shows the power of money and greed, and its message was proven with the stock market crash. This book was a combination of a description and a narration. It described the roaring twenties. It showed everything that was happening in the roaring twenties and tried to be realistic in its portrayal of life. It was a narration as well, because it told a fictional story of The Great Gatsby and his undying love. One way it was realistic was that it showed all the rich people as prohibition bootleggers. It did show crazy parties that were a little unrealistic. I enjoyed the novel. The roaring twenties is a very interesting time period to set a novel in. This novel definitely holds up to today's standards, even though it was written in 1926. The story was very sad, and even though I wouldn't change it, it made me sad. I believe that was integral to the message of the novel though. The Great Gatsby is one of the best overall classics I've read. "
742,Georgia Smith,"Exactly what I'd been hoping for in a novel. I'm a massive fan of early 20th century literature and no one does it better than Fitzgerald. I feel the same about this book as I do about Tender is the Night - he is so intricate with his placing of characteristics and statements that everything blurs together into an infinite set of judgments. If you know what I mean. He introduces information about the characters in such a meticulous way as to blur them all together.I thought this was a wonderful book and it thrived on mystery and suspense. The characters were so engaging and intelligent, they seemed to exist in a world of their own. I always wonder whether people like them would ever have existed in the real world, or if they're a projection of Fitzgerald's own hopes for society. I sure haven't met any of them. They seem otherworldly and superior, with a clear-headedness and clear-mindedness that transcends most of the people I know.Neat twist at the end, although I felt everything fell as it should have. Fitzgerald is beautiful and I can never get enough of him. I wish I'd had the opportunity to meet him. This book is as good an example of his tentative flourishes as Tender is the Night, with a mix between cautiousness and recklessness as strong as any other book I've ever read."
743,Samuel Rooke,"Can't say anything about this fantastic novel that hasn't already been said better. The prose is excellent, it's well-paced (how I enjoy a novel with no meandering subplots or dalliances), and thematically rich. The futility of the American ideal of working hard and earning your way into the upper classes is portrayed well; the reproduction of British class divisions in the seemingly free America is a sad irony Fitzgerald clearly thought important to examine. I think the fruitlessness of trying to turn back time is the broader theme in the novel, which encapsulates the more specific American dream and class division themes. I find the interplay between Gatsby's fruitless attempts to reproduce the past, and the East Eggers unwitting reproduction of the British class divisions of the past, fascinating. It's impressive Fitzgerald packed so much depth into a novel much shorter than most of its ""Great American Novel"" peers.I happily give it five green lights, and one pair of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg glasses (5/5)."
744,Mayra Correa e Castro,"Adaptado três vezes para o cinema e outras três vezes para a TV, o romance O Grande Gatsby (1925) ganhará nova versão cinematográfica em 2013. Ela será, com certeza, estonteante, reluzente, exagerada e diabolicamente excitante, já que virá pelas mãos do diretor de Moulin Rouge (2001), Baz Luhrmann. Então parece apropriado reler a história para, quando formos assistir ao filme, suprimirmos dele toda a falta de sensatez que o diretor certamente injetará nas cenas fulcrais do livro, como a primeira festa no palacete de Gatsby a que Nick Carraway comparece. Mas, pelo que já pode ser visto no trailer, Baz também deverá oferecer doses generosas de diálogos literais extraídos do livro, como a insólita frase que Daisy dirige a Gatsby no reencontro dos dois, a coisa mais estúpida que uma mulher poderia dizer ao grande amor de sua vida: “Certamente tenho um imenso prazer em vê-lo de novo.”Fitzgerald (1896-1940) , o autor do livro, é uma unanimidade dentro e fora dos Estados Unidos, uma sombra que persegue – junto com tudo o mais que aconteceu no Entre Guerras – , todos aqueles que idealizam uma vida com liberdade, riqueza, inteligência e fígado blindado contra porres homéricos. Antes de O Grande Gatsby – concluído na França quando Fitzgerald já estava casado com Zelda Sayre – , ele já tinha publicado dois romances que o tornaram famoso: Este Lado do Paraíso (1920) e Os Belos e Malditos (1922). Mas em 1925 ele tiraria todo o excesso e arrastado que houvera em Os Belos e Malditos, manteria a temática da vida irresponsável e libertina de jovens norte-americanos ricos, e criaria Gatsby, uma pequena joia feita de ritmo alucinante com interrupções para solos estridentes. Como alguns dizem, a tradução, em letras, do jazz.A história, você bem sabe, é narrada por Nick Carraway, um interiorano que chega em Nova York para trabalhar na Bolsa de Valores e, graças a parentes distantes, acaba frequentando a alta e suspeita sociedade que mantinha mansões e festas no litoral de Long Island. Uma dessas mansões, que vinha a ser vizinha do modesto sobrado onde ele morava, pertencia Gatsby. Quando se conhecem, Gatsby descobre que Nick era parente de um antigo amor que ele abandonou para ir à Primeira Guerra e pede que ele dê uma de cupido, reatando o romance dos dois.O impactante da narrativa é nem tanto o mistério que envolve Gatsby, porque não se sabe ao certo de onde ele veio nem como enriqueceu, apenas que enriqueceu por meios ilícitos, mas a ingênua defesa que Nick tenta fazer do gênero humano, mostrando que, por trás das aparências, como lhe ensinou seu pai, as pessoas têm suas boas razões. Em 2013, Nick será vivido por Tobey Maguire, que já foi o homem-aranha no cinema. Não consigo pensar em escolha mais confiável. Tobey tem o rosto certo para transmitir a mensagem de que a vida dos que nasceram ricos é muito boa, muito invejável e sedutora mas, obrigado, prefiro continuar pegando o trem para trabalhar porque não quero que nada de trágico aconteça comigo.Abaixo selecionei algumas partes bacanas. A tradução que usei foi de William Lagos, compilada para a edição de bolso da L&PM. Mas a Penguin Cia. das Letras lançou a sua também, feita por Vanessa Barbara em 2011. Como houve várias versões do romance para as telas, creio que valha a pena ler as várias traduções que há para o português.Leia o restante da resenha com citações comentadas:http://asmelhorespartes.blogspot.com...."
745,David Jen,"Upon the numerous times I have read this book, I am left with a profound impression that The Great Gatsby has reached the highest tidemark a fiction genre novel possibly can, in the form of perfectly blending complication (various layers with seemingly-complicated scenarios that go on simultaneously in the background, which might not sound logically correct to the reader in the early stages of the book, however, any doubts that the reader might harbour is resolved as the story progresses and unfolds) with harmony (Saying that it is simply a pleasant book to read for leisure is far from what this all time classic deserves). If one were to have encountered this book previously, he/she would find themselves completely emerged and brought into the scenario of America in the ""roaring 20's"" by Fitzgerald, where America as a country was in a hangover that hasn't lasted since the victory of World War 1. The novel explores in vast detail themes such as idealism, social upheaval, as well as an era where America indulged itself in lavish and extravagant excesses in addition to the unethical behaviour of some characters. This can be demonstrated through the struggles and conflicts that exist between Jay Gatsby, Tom Buchanan and Daisy Buchanan. Namely - Jay Gatsby's quixotic passion for the beautiful and staggeringly attractive Daisy Buchanan is met with numerous ""obstacles"" along the way that would take serious effort to eradicate (especially Tom Buchanan, to whom Daisy is now married to), which in the end Gatsby failed to do so, yet he still maintained his unconditional and protecting love towards Daisy, regardless of the setbacks he has met on his path to regaining Daisy's love. All along this perilous journey of reclaiming Daisy's love, Gatsby had a man who supported him both mentally and morally as he progressed along. That man was Nick Carraway, as the two men have been in a relationship of mutual assistance and interest, as when Nick Carraway felt depressed deep down, Gatsby could provide him with a smile that would brighten his day, as evidenced by; ""He smiled understandingly-much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life"". (52) From here and on, Carraway and Gatsby have assisted each other through times of need, and have developed a mutual bond that can never be broken. Likewise, this book does contain a generous amount of tragic events, making it a rather emotional book to read as the reader simply gets into character in a split second that places one in a position that makes oneself feel attached to the tragic events as if they were to be actually involved in it. I personally was flooded with emotions when I was thrown into a river of my own tears on one occasion, which was my first read of this superb novel 5 years ago where I was literally filled with sorrow for Gatsby's and Daisy's failed romance, and Gatsby's unfortunate death towards the end. For the reasons above, I have maintained and always will (supposedly) that this novel is amongst the very best American novels to read for leisure and most definitely pleasure. "
746,Michael Johnston,"Although frequently listed among the 100 greatest books of all time, I never read The Great Gatsby as a young man (I was a Political Science major - reading literature was not on my to do list!). In retrospect it seems clear to me that this may have been a benefit. The meaning of great literature, it seems to me, is often lost on the young. Certainly not because they do not have the intelligence. Rather because they do not have the experience.I understand Fitzgerald's meaning - his cynacism and disgust - to a much greater degree because of my life's experiences. The book is brilliantly written. Short, rapid fire and intriguing, Fitzgerald's story of the pointlessness of the lives of the nouveau riche in 1920's America holds poignant meaning for the 21st century. Gatsby's life was driven by ambition, a need for riches and an extreme desire for a life lived in the throws of conspicuous consumption. Yet none of it led to happiness. Having worked on Wall Street for more than 20 years (leaving just before the latest fiscal crisis), the themes and actions of Gatsby's ""crowd"" are eerily familiar to me. A culture driven only by monetary gain and consumption is ultimately tragic because it is a waste of a lifetime. It has been said that you can't take it with you so what is the purpose of excess accumulation? That may be true, but perhaps Jacob Riis had a better understanding of our purpose in life when he said ""The saddest of all things must be to go to one's grave with the feeling that in nothing one has been able to soothe or help the world's misery.""Greed and the extreme pursuit of riches was, I believe, at the heart of the financial crisis. Our financial system offered no incentive to do the right thing, only the most profitable thing. Based on Fitzgerald's take on life in the Jazz age, it doesn't seem like we have come very far. Read this book to understand what is imporant in life and what isn't. But also read it for Fitzgerald's brilliant writing style. "
747,Karen Tannenbaum,"Ah, the class system during the flapper days. I do not admire Jay Gatsby in the least, in fact, believe he is pathetic to love such a vaccuous person as Daisy Buchanan. But, historically great literature. I Rated it a five because it belongs to the ages. And the old adage ""money can't buy happiness."" Read when I was a senior in HS...never left me. Another book about Manners, Morals and Society.....Edith Wharton's ""The Age of Innocence."" IMO one of the greatest novels ever written about the societal armed camp of wit and shunning wars when a member of High Society goes against form."
748,Stephanie Joy,I wanted to re-read this before the movie comes out in May and realized I don't think I ever finished reading it in 11th grade. I found myself reading too quickly and having to read pages multiple times to completely absorb Fitzgerald's prose... Not necessarily a bad thing to have to take it slow and appreciate the language he used to paint a picture of American culture during the Jazz Age. Beautiful story!
749,Sjunebug,"I liked it a lot better the second time through, understood it more than in high school. I don't have to like the characters or the author or how the book makes me feel to appreciate that it IS a great book. Because it DOES make me feel, draws me in, and making someone feel depression and anger and hatred is a lot harder than creating a character a reader will love, I think. Also... There's a fantastic description of mania (at least as I, and others I know, experience it) in the book, though Fitzgerald never mentions the word. "
750,Fiona ,"I LOVE LOVE LOVED the Great Gatsby! I've always loved the classics, and I have to say that this is a new favorite for sure. I've actually been meaning to read it for a while, but I never got around to it until it was assigned to me in English. I'm so glad that it was... I finished it in two days, and since we were forced to mark the book with sticky notes and take notes, I became really aware of the wonderful language and writing that F Scott Fitzgerald uses in the book. I completely fell in love with the characters, and was enthralled with the message that the book gave. I won't give away any spoilers (unlike the person who wrote graffiti-ed in the library copy that I read...>:( ) so that if you haven't read it you can experience the whole thing by yourself. It's a shame that more teenagers my age don't find books like this as interesting and fascinating as I do, perhaps we would grow up to be better people if more of us did... Anyways, it was a great book, I recommend it to everyone! :) "
751,John Lauricella,"The Great Gatsby (1925) is a dangerously charming and sad story about a man whose self-reinvention both makes his life and destroys it. The trajectory of Jay Gatz's career describes a version of the American Dream as the arc approaches its apex--those fabulous summers'-night parties of Jay Gatsby, the rich, young bon vivant and handsome man of mystery who attracts legions of bright young things to his Long Island mansion even as he hides from them--yet its dying fall leaves the reader with a sense of a lesson taught and learned: not merely that recapturing the past and re-living isn't possible (didn't Proust already demonstrate this truth?), but that the circumstances of real life do not treat dreams kindly and tend to be inimical to the idealists who pursue them.A trumped-up persona and dubious ""business"" dealings tend to make Gatsby a fatally attractive figure--a ""good bad boy,"" as Leslie Fiedler might have pegged him. To note that Gatsby is at least half a fraud--a trafficker in what one intimates are assorted illegalities, a kind of con-man in personal relationships--is to make a valid point that also somewhat misses a greater truth: Gatsby is an idealist in the service of the self. In pursuing his goals at any cost, he is enacting in thought and deed the main exhortation of American culture: seize every likely opportunity to better yourself, to the end of making a profit. In his relentless self-reinvention, Gatsby is a type of the American Striver and Go-Getter, the Nobody from Nowhere who sets out to make his fortune in the Land of Opportunity. At his disposal are whatever innate qualities he can turn to his advantage in persuading other people, and America in general, to give him what he wants--and what he believes is his due.To better understand Gatsby's motive, replace ""what"" with ""who"" in the sentence just above. The money, the mansion, the self-consciously fabricated persona of insouciant cool are all lines on the résumé he believes he must put together to impress Daisy Buchanan, née Fay, as a legitimate and compelling suitor. The problem, of course, is that time has passed; Daisy is not only married but a mother. Her time to entertain suitors, however beautifully-credentialed, is long gone. The noisome fact that she is married to the personally obnoxious, morally odious (and very rich) Tom Buchanan forces Gatsby to attempt a gambit of extreme revisionism: goad Daisy to perform a kind of emotional erasure by stating, with Nick Carraway and Jordan Baker and Tom himself as witnesses, that she has never loved her brutal husband (to give him his due and notwithstanding his gross infidelity with Myrtle Wilson, Tom does seem truly to love Daisy all along--although possibly as his crowning possession, a cut above his polo ponies).Daisy tries to undo the past, or at least to rewrite it, managing to say I never loved him. Prompted by Tom with a few salient memories, however, she realizes it isn't true. She has loved him, notwithstanding whatever she might think of him now. Her concession is telling; in trying to say why it is impossible to deny an emotion once felt, Daisy both rebukes Gatsby and pin-points the reason he must fail to achieve his dream: ""Oh, you want too much!""Overreaching toward an Absolute: thus it ever is with the romantic idealist, especially one who can fully incarnate his dream only by scripting his paramour's emotional life. The impulse Gatsby would describe as his love of Daisy reveals itself, ironically, as a drive for another kind of ownership--an unseemly mingling of sex and property that tends to make him, on this one count, not so different from Tom. The ""Life"" each wants to own must include Daisy, or a woman very much like her: the ""right kind of girl,"" one who is very beautiful and very rich. Tom owns this Life by the great good luck of birth and holds it negligently; entitled to his smugness and presumption, he is self-justified in acting on both. Gatsby has had to improvise his way to West Egg: first to imagine, then to fabricate a version of himself qualified on all counts (except birth) to possess a Life ""commensurate to his capacity for wonder"" and merit the ""love"" (if affection and respect of such magnitude are possible at the Buchanans' level of fortune) of a woman who is both a perfect symbol of that Life and the embodiment of Gatsby's desire to claim it as his own.So much for what we already knew. The novel's most suggestive aspects don't so much involve Gatsby, despite his status as titular character, as they do its narrator. Implicitly, it is Nick who conceives of this strange, vaguely duplicitous, disastrously misplaced dreamer as ""great."" His first-person tale-telling is heavily biased in favor of the re-made Gatz, in whom Nick perceives a possible strategy of self-improvement, had he (Nick) a ""capacity for wonder"" that could overcome what seems his inherent (one is tempted to call it instinctive) diffidence. Effectively, Nick discovers an object of wonder in Gatsby--without his fascination with the man, there is no novel--to whose grand pursuit and almost literal crash-and-burn he can only bear witness.As Nick sees it, Gatsby is ""great"" because he has the courage to commit himself to the pursuit of an ideal: the Life he can imagine for himself, the dream(girl) he believes is destined to belong to him. Despite the long odds against him, Gatsby persists in his quest for Daisy's love notwithstanding her manifest unworthiness (which Nick acknowledges). Nothing can deflect him from his chosen course, no compromise or expedience enlisted in its pursuit can cheapen it. Even Gatsby's shady, opportunistic (and distinctly empirical--that is, the opposite of idealistic) wheeling-dealing with Meyer Wolfsheim fails to demean him in Nick's eyes. Wolfsheim, frankly depicted by Fitzgerald as an unsavory and sentimental Jew, is described by Gatsby as a gambler--""the man who fixed the World's Series back in 1919."" That both Nick and Gatsby are genteel anti-Semites doubtlessly makes it easy for Nick to align himself with Gatsby and dismiss the latter's association with Wolfsheim as merely business; and yet, Nick's seeming neutrality suggests that he considers Gatsby's dream worth its realization by any means necessary.It seems that, for Nick, the idealism of Gatsby's romantic lost cause trumps all else and makes him ""great."" Nick's assessment is surprising, given what we are generally told about the hard-edged, seize-the-moment attitude of the post-war 1920s. Idealism is supposed to have been discredited and abstract nouns like ""love"" and ""honor"" (and ""great""?) distrusted, or at least not taken seriously, in the death-pall that spread from the trenches and No-Man's-Land of the First World War. Gatsby and Nick, however, seem to be acting on pre-war conceptions of metaphysical value, notwithstanding the ""modern"" amorality of Gatsby's sexual stalking and Nick's pandering to it--as if these behaviors had never been enacted and indulged before 1925. Perhaps for some witnesses (and readers), romantic idealism never becomes archaic--even if its ulterior agenda is the self-aggrandizement of the idealist.As the novel ends, one understands that the true romantic is Nick Carraway, who has authored the checkered career of Jay Gatz/Gatsby as a fatally seductive tale of love and loss and longing. Lacking Gatsby's talent for sustaining ""an unbroken series of successful gestures""--called ""personality"" by Nick--he seeks incarnation of the ideal through narrative art. It isn't that Nick is so foolish as to consider Gatsby exemplary or anything like that--far from it--or that he has, through some sort of canny delusion, convinced himself that a dream is more tangible than reality. Nick recognizes that to attain one's dream is also to lose it: if the ideal becomes incarnate, it also becomes perishable. Gatsby's romantic--one might even call it sentimental--memory of Daisy Fay of Louisville can survive inviolate, preserved forever in the amber of his imagination, only if it remains a memory, a notion, and his desire rises, ironically, only to the level of a velleity. As an idea, it is all promise and potential. As achieved fact, it is subject to compromise, disappointment, accident, and loss. It is no surprise that Gatsby forfeits his life in attempting to wrest his dream into reality. Unrealistic, imprudent, and amoral, his insistence on reliving the past differently, and reshaping the present thereby, cannot succeed because too much hard fact, and too many hard people, are arrayed in opposition. However, by capturing this grand passion and woeful end in words, Nick redeems Gatsby's errors of over-commitment and preserves the essential optimism of his pursuit. "
752,Vlasta Řenčová,"Pět a půl hodiny skvělého poslechu. Miluju audioknihy a miluju Gatsbyho. Knížku jsem četla v červnu 2014, sakra, to letí, a od té doby jsem ještě neviděla film. Teď ho prý budou dávat. Příběh v podání Filipa Čapky byl snad ještě působivější, než když jsem ho četla. Nebo to možná bylo tím, že jsem se na to mohla dívat jinýma očima a vidět v tom spoustu nových věcí, které tam předtím.. nebyly. Velký Gatsby prostě bude vždycky moje srdcovka. "
753,Monica Joseph,"The Great Gatsby is one of those books that you hear everyone talking about. You don't fully understand it until you decide to open up the pages and read it yourself. This is the sad tale of Jay Gatsby, a millionaire who hopelessly chases the elusive dream of being with the woman he loves, Daisy Buchanan. My friend boldly claims that Gatsby doesn't really love Daisy, but the idea of her. She is everything he admires, carelessly rich and glowingly beautiful, so he wishes to have her, and refuses to forget her for five years after he last sees her. I noted while reading this book that it contains characters that are sad, but not aware of the fact. They are living in a gleaming world of superficiality, where love always seems in question and where wealth shrouds sincerity and replaces it with a sense of hopelessness and fabrication. This book is also masterfully written, Fitzgerald crafts sentences that blur the lines between prose and poetry, and expertly designs the melancholy and bright world these characters live in."
754,Caroline,"Daisy gets away with red lipstick, with terrible parenting, with murder itself. Oh, I mused, if only I spent my days sipping from crystal champagne flutes, tooled around town in a “little white roadster,” spoke with a voice “full of money” then, then the world around me would twinkle and sparkle, twinkle and sparkle and suitors would “demand the privilege of monopolizing” me for the evening and I could do no wrong (Fitzgerald 74, 120, 74). A careless disposition, “bright eyes,” and a desire for the attentions and influence of men make Daisy Buchanan a dream girl (Fitzgerald 9). Because she embodies the fantasies of every seventeen year-old boy, Daisy becomes, for me, as a seventeen year-old girl, a sort of yardstick to measure up against. Her predicament begs the question: would life as the spitting image of a teenage boy’s dream really be so magical, so glittering? In reality, I know that when I compare myself to Daisy, try to emulate her irresistible giggle, I work not towards my ideal (a strong, smart, independent woman with a biting wit and a secret recipe for perfect chocolate chip cookies) but rather aspire to an empty vessel for a boy’s desires. Inherent problems with Daisy’s model for the “perfect woman” exist just below the surface because a woman formed for another can never feel comfortable as her true self. Masculine ambition and aspiration shape Fitzgerald’s world and mine. Louis Tyson describes this phenomenon, a social sphere built on the ideas of men, as a patriarchy (86) which propagates myths like Daisy’s perfection because men seek women to help them advance in their own lives, who will embody their dreams and possess none of their own. Each man acts as Pygmalion creating his own cast, binding himself to the “colossal vitality of his illusion” (Fitzgerald 96). Daisy, wanting “her life shaped now, immediately,” her independent wishes undefined, fits easily into many men’s molds (Fitzgerald 151). This malleability, this easily modified shape, fulfills patriarchal desires for power and influence over women. She does not depend on her own goals to motivate her, to spur her into action, but rather waits for a male supplied impetus. Gatsby kisses Daisy and “she blossom[s] for him like a flower” (Fitzgerald 110). For him, she changes. He instigates the transformation, she simply complies. A lack of authenticity stems from this subjugation, limiting a woman’s desires to the desires of men. When she attempts to alter her defined role, the men surrounding her punish or reject her. I strive to exist in a state cognizant of the standards of the boys’ club yet engaged in shaping myself rather than being shaped by them. To compare my character to Daisy’s is to compare my physical appearance to an airbrushed model in a magazine, her proportions realigned to match male society’s view of beauty, her pores erased to a reptilian smoothness. These “perfect” women embody the effect of patriarchy, hoisting male desires onto the shoulders of girls too often blinded by the omnipresence of an overriding male culture to even realize that they aspire to a borrowed dream. A product of patriarchy, Daisy represents and embodies this dream, internalizing it in its entirety. Yet, her insecurities with her bland and predetermined life occasionally seep through to reveal her dissatisfaction with the idealized role imposed upon her— “‘What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?’ cried Daisy, ‘and the day after that, and the next thirty years?’” (Fitzgerald 118). Daisy must, at the very least, have a general sense of what will occupy her afternoon and a broader sense of how she will spend the rest of her life. This unspoken realization, the knowledge that very little in her life will change as long as she lives under her husband’s roof, troubles her. Daisy does not fear the unknown but rather the gilded monotony of a thousand tomorrows. She will forever exist as a “silver idol” in her own home, frozen on a pedestal by her sculptor (Fitzgerald 115, Tyson 90). Men equate power with ownership, they therefore objectify women, transforming them into possessions. In a man’s world, “the man looks; the woman is looked at. And it is the one who looks who is in control,” giving Gatsby, Nick, Tom, and the boys I meet at parties the privilege of determining the standards of womanhood (Tyson 102). The “male gaze” has the power to assess the value of a woman and to convey to her the results of the evaluation. Gatsby looks at Daisy “in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at,” and the reader immediately understands what this means (Tyson 102, Fitzgerald 75). This is the power of the male gaze, the intrinsic desire and ability to assess and possess. Tom and Gatsby obsess over the notion of monopolizing Daisy’s love. When Daisy observes their barely hidden game of tug-a-war erupt into a heated argument in a New York hotel room, she pleads with Gatsby, “I love you now — isn’t that enough?” (Fitzgerald 132). She continues, “I did love [Tom] once — but I loved you too” (Fitzgerald 132). Neither Tom nor Gatsby can grasp the concept of an “I love you ‘too.’” Neither can reconcile their image of a girl simultaneously belonging to them yet loving another. To challenge their sole possession of Daisy and her absolute devotion is to challenge their manhood. A weak man cannot control his wife; a lacking lover cannot keep hold of his mistress. These men cannot handle the knowledge that they have, at some point, lost or shared Daisy’s love. Doing so would be an affront to their success as men. I do not want to be a possession like Daisy. Instead, an understanding of her persona, allows me to view the male dominated world I live in with a heightened sense of awareness and a better sense of myself. To understand Daisy, I must shake her through the sieve of patriarchy, allow her idealized façade to crumble to dust and fall through the mesh, leaving behinds clumps of her true personality and human desires. Though her façade garners the attention and adoration of numerous admirers, Daisy pays a high price its maintenance, a price I am not willing to pay. In sacrificing her dreams, aspirations and individuality before the alter of patriarchy, she looses all chances of self-satisfaction. "
755,Livi,"A ciertas escenas las visualicé tan vívidamente que no puedo creerlo.. ¡Que manera de escribir este hombre! y que invitación a la reflexión. Me pareció un libro tristísimo, no por la trama en sí, ni por lo que le sucede a cada personaje en especifico, sino por todo lo implícito, lo que acompaña y da forma a esos personajes. Me quedó el regusto amargo de esa sociedad ostentosa descrita con tan cruento realismo y la idea de que, en cierta forma, la historia se repite y repite en todas las décadas ¡Viva el sueño americano y la Coca-Cola! "
756,Megan Going,"The Great Gatsby is a fascinating book written from the perspective of Nick Carraway, a man from Minnesota who moves to New York. A mysterious man lives next door to him know as Gatsby. The tale unfolds as more drama goes down in the both West and East Egg where his cousin lives. The story unravels into a full out drama with people drinking, cheating, and murdering. Nick is lost in the middle of the drama being from a small town but very educated unlike his rich neighbors. This story is historical in the aspect that is explores the twenties and the extravagant times the rich lived in verses the poor lives of the rest of the city. This book is meant to be read by high school aged students and can be a learning tool for an english classroom. "
757,Ada Gao," The Great Gatsby is about Nick Carraway and his experience with his next door neighbor,Jay Gatsby. Jay Gatsby is a guy that is next door to Nick, always looking at him through his bedroom window staring at Nick just waiting for the time to talk to Nick and Daisy Buchanan - the girl that he loved ever since 5 years ago. Daisy was Nick's cousin so Gatsby asked Nick to invite her over to his house so they can talk. They lived on opposite sides of the docks, Nick and Gatsby lived on the West Egg while Daisy and Tom Buchanan ( Daisy's husband) lived in the East Egg. This book was really good, it got me really emotional throughout the whole book because it was so sweet to have someone like Gatsby but also frustrating because at the end Daisy did not care about Gatsby at all, leaving all the crimes to him and letting him die, alone in his abandoned house. It was a intense and interesting book to read. I really recommend this book to people that likes unpredictable novels. While reading this novel, I did not expect Gatsby to die unless the part when Daisy killed Myrtle. "
758,Raghad Khamees,"The Great Gatsby is a consummate summary of the roaring twenties and a devastating exposé of the Jazz Age. Through the narration of Nick Carraway, the reader is taken into the superficially glittering world of mansions which line the Long Island shore of the American seaboard in 1920s, to encounter Nich's cousin Daisy, Jay Gatsby ,and the dark mystery which surrounds him.jay Gatsby who believes in his dream and did his best just to feel Daisy's love,but Daisy , the materialistic,shallow,and greedy woman doesn't deserve Gatsby's love. I felt sorry for Gatsby.I recommend everyone to read this amazing novel."
759,Elizabeth,Listened to audio read by Jake Gyllenhaal. Quite pleasant.
760,Catherine Mesick,"Just re-read The Great Gatsby. Love, love Fitzgerald's beautiful prose."
761,Nate Ross,"The Great Gatsby is an undeniable American Masterpiece. Fitzgerald's elegant prose propels the narrative forward as the simple, yet not oversimplistic, plot unfolds. He manages to illustrate a magnificent story that leaves numerous comments on the nature of the American Dream. The first is that America is now home to an aristocracy that it had fought so hard to get away from. Secondly, that aristocracy has created a class of social climbers who try their hardest to attain the rank of aristocracy, but that it is impossible to attain this goal. Not only is it unattainable, it is undesirable to do so. "
762,Joy,"I've wanted to reread this book for a while. When I read this in high school I was not altogether impressed with American literature in general. I was reading Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, all of Jane Austen, and Shakespeare for fun. Books set in America, like The Sea of Grass (shudder), just didn't appeal to me. I don't think I gave The Great Gatsby a fair try. It was a school assignment, full of unlikable characters and obvious symbolism, with the last couple of paragraphs touching me the most.There is something comforting in reading beloved books over and over. It's like visiting an old friend, slipping quietly back into a world we love. Reading this again, a book I thought was okay when I was teenager, has been more satisfying than I expected. It's so much more than okay. It's amazing. The gorgeous prose and imagery. The tightness of the structure. The people who seem very real. And yes, the symbolism, which isn't just the eyes and the green light I remembered. So yes, I've increased my catch-all three star rating to five stars. Gatsby worked it's spell on me. American classic indeed."
763,Michelle Reyes,"The Great Gatsby was a well written novel full of small comedy and a look into the past. Scott Fitzgerald focused his idea on the fact that this novel deals with old money versus new money. He shows this with his characterization of Nick and Gatsby. Nick comes from the old money meaning he was born into it while on the other hand Gatsby recently got his money from his past. I think that he really showed how society mostly cared about the wealth and if you weren't you were look down upon. He also uses a great deal of colors. For me I felt like the most dominant colors were white and gold. The color white represents the honorable; those who care too much about how much money they have and are materialistic. As for gold, it represents new gold and old gold as I explained before. He also uses the colors to portray the characters different personalities. Overall, it was an enjoyable novel and the ending came to a surprise but yet foreshadowed from the past events. I would definitely recommend this book to others and it gives you an idea of the way that people lived in the 1920's also known as the roaring 20s. "
764,Joan Xu,"The Great Gatsby is one of my top 10 books of all time. I've read this book about 10 times since reading it for the first time as required reading in high school, and it has only gotten better with time for a number of reasons:1) As someone who likes to observe others, I love how the story is told. The entire story is told from the perspective of an introverted observer (Nick) watching and experiencing the many layers of Gatsby, which include an introvert pretending to an extrovert, a poor man pretending to be rich, and a vulnerable and pretty sensitive person pretending to be carelessly fun. This allows you to psychoanalyze Nick as he's psychoanalyzing Gatsby, which, you would know if you've ever participated in any psychoanalyzing of your own, is really fun. :)2) There's always some theme in this story that is somehow relevant to my life. For instance, I very recently finished an MBA program in which certain characters liked to throw lavish parties for others who would party at them as though the world were to end tomorrow. Sound familiar?"
765,Rosalind,I read this book as we drove north through France and really enjoyed it - superb!
766,Joe,My favorite...period. I'm rereading it now.
767,Maureen,"I have gone through many phases in my career as a reader, and one of them was most certainly an F. Scott Fitzgerald phase. A classic of the Jazz Age or any age, no education can be considered complete without reading The Great Gatsby."
768,Joh,"I read the Great Gatsby my junior year of high school at my English teacher’s urging. While I definitely enjoyed it at the time, I didn’t get into it nearly as much as I did during a second reading for my AP Lit class (senior year). Our class discussions were definitely an incentive to read with the purpose of searching for that deeper meaning (because c’mon, you don’t want to look like a total moron in front of the top 10% of your graduating class…), but I think at least two reads were crucial to notice key symbols (the green light, East Egg/West Egg, etc.) and discern meaning beneath the plot’s exterior.My feelings towards the characters are somewhat ambivalent…it’s difficult to explain how it can be possible to love and hate a character simultaneously, but Daisy definitely inspired such feelings within me. Perhaps it has something to do with my then-boyfriend (and first love) conferring her name upon me (we always gave each other ridiculous literary pseudonyms), but I can’t help but like her…despite a few less than savory characteristics. Likewise, it’s difficult to believe that Nick is quite the reliable narrator I, at first glance, took him to be. And then there’s Gatsby…his elaborate world of fantasy ceases to be charming after awhile and eventually leaves quite a bitter (and disillusioned) taste…"
769,Kev,"For a long time I avoided Gatsby and Fitzgerald, under the impression that I wouldn't like it, nor the author. Think it links back to some quotes sourced from Fitzgerald. This is obviously all ridiculous and I should be slapped.Turns out that Fitzgerald can write. The language in this novel is exquisite and it's been a while since I was so drawn into another world. I found myself reading it with ease among distractions, something I find rare - a testament to Fitzgerald and his ability to hold you in his story and usher you along like old Gatsby himself is walking beside you. The narration is perfect, and the scenes of conflict, in particular the Plaza scene, are immaculate. In a writing sense, and also history, there's a lot you can learn from this novel.Gatsby is a chap, old sport."
770,Watchingthewords,"I read The Great Gatsby in high school and it was OK. It’s interesting what some years (and I’m not talking about how many!) can do to your perspective because I just finished reading it again and I loved it. I think the beauty of the book, and the sadness of the story, are wasted on most high school students. The future still looms far in front of them, full of opportunity and time and chances. It doesn’t elude them, it’s still in front of them, still something to reach for and achieve. There is no melancholy yet for their youth, for the chance to be young again and make different choices, to set the path right. Yet in spite of all that the characters have been through, as jaded as they should be, I was struck in some ways by their innocence. Gatsby’s unwavering belief in his love for Daisy and its ability to overcome all other circumstances reminds me of the hopefulness that exists in the young. It’s just that they don’t have any reason to believe differently yet, and Gatsby does. Even Daisy’s heartlessness and cruelty is wrapped in its own kind of confusion and innocence. It’s not like she means to ruin anyone’s life… Some of my favorite moments…In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. ""Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,"" he told me, ""just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.” Not only shouldn’t we judge Gatsby, but we shouldn’t judge Daisy, or Tom, or any of them. Because there are all kinds of advantages, not all of them monetary, which impact the way people behave. It reminds me of a conversation I recently had with my kids about my son’s frustration with what he perceives as rampant apathy among some of his classmates – remember kid, you don’t know what their life is like, or what yours would be like if you were them…And so heartbreaking:“The loneliest moment in someone’s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.” 'Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter — to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning —— So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.'See more on my blog at www.watchingthewords.wordpress.com "
771,Davide,"Raramente valuto con 5 stelle un libro, ma questo è uno dei pochi che le merita. Pienamente.Ne ""Il Grande Gatsby"" c'è tutto: amore, potere, ricchezza, sangue, noia, storia contemporanea, ogni cosa raccontata con un superbo stile venato d'ironia, pieno di una classe senza tempo.L'autore fotografa in un bianco e nero ricco di dettagli e di ombre nette e contrastate l'inizio secolo americano, in una piena espansione consumistica che fa da contraltare ad una sempre maggiore pochezza di sentimenti. La vita stessa di Gatsby ne è l'emblema: uno sfarzo costruito, ma che annoia. Uno scintillante castello di carte pronto ad accasciarsi sotto il peso della sua roboante facciata, in un vuoto tanto più assordante quanto la musica usata per coprirlo, ma mai riempirlo.È spaventosamente profetico il contesto sociale che l'autore tratteggia: una decadenza che è causa e prodotto di un profondo, pesante e sempre più grande vuoto.""Il Grande Gatsby"" non lascia spazio a troppe speranze, ma ci regala una visione. Sta a noi saperla guardare."
772,Jon,"This is, quite possibly, the Great American Novel. Certainly Melville’s ""Moby Dick"" has more heavy symbolism, and, thanks in part to its age, a greater stylistic weight, but Fitzgerald’s work is the seminal story of America. It’s both a book about the perennial American optimism and desire for reinvention, and a parable about our inability to escape that which engendered us.The Great Gatsby contains the American experience in small. The story may be about one man’s search for the girl he never got over, but the theme is more complex. It’s about the conflict between two opposing realities: the romantic possibility that citizens of this great country are bound by nothing but their talents and imaginations, and the more quotidian likelihood that a man’s background is insurmountable and, in the end, only money matters.In many ways, I think that the story’s keystone—its crux, its thematic lynchpin—is the sentence in which the transformation of James Gatz, of North Dakota, into Jay Gatsby, someday to be of West Egg, Long Island, is summarized: “So he invented the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent.” After all, what is this country if not an adolescent dream of itself, with all the good and ill that entails? Youthful vigor, strength of character, obstinate idealism, and an unconscious, ingrained sense of hopeful predestination that often falls short of its imaginings—these things are America.It's a book of genius, with quotable lines on every page. Like:""“She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’s full of—”I hesitated.“Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly.That was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of money—that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it . . .-- or --Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have known.-- or --Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope.-- or --There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion.-- or --They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made . . . -- or --“I’m thirty,” I said. “I’m five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor.” She didn’t answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away."
773,MissMangoReads,"BOOK SYNOPSIS: Nick Carraway's mysterious decadent but mysterious neighbour Jay Gatsby holds frequent elaborate party and seems to be a man of extensive wealth with not much too him. But something's different about Gatsby. He seems strangely captivated by a green light across the river, and when he starts to open to Nick and ask for his help, it's suddenly clear that his motives are much more simple, more pure, than anyone could have expected. MY REVIEW:""The loneliest moment in someone life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all the can do is stare blankly.""Let me just start this of by saying that the language was absolutely beautiful. It's a cliche, I know, but you can't help but marvel at the thinks that F. Scott Fitzgerald thinks up. I remember reading a line towards the beginning of the book that went something like, ""Her nose bled fluently"", and thinking, God it'd be great if I could use that in an English exam or something.This is a classic, in case you didn't already know (and if you didn't, have you been living under a rock the past few years?). It was written around the 1920s or 30s and so the language used is a little different to nowadays, more posh, as some people will put it. Perhaps you have to concentrate a little more on what's being said, but don't let that put you off. It's really not that hard to read a classic, and this one in particular has and fantastic and enthralling story, with intriguing characters, a lot of whom are severely mean and unlikeable, but some you can't help but love, especially Gatsby.I personally haven't read a lot of classics, but I think this one was a good introduction. I adore the story of Gatsby, the simplicity and tragedy of it all. Sometimes there are small sections where you get lost in the language and have to go back to take it all in, but overall the writing was brilliantly poignant, and judging it on what it is, I'm going to give it a 5/5."
774,Valeria,"It was definitely brilliant. It isn't easy to understand at the beginning, since it's Nick's story that he himself tells a little. Then, not long after, Gatsby appears on the pages of the book.A man who appears to have everything. Who throws this big, amazing parties. A man who inspects everything with acclaiming eyes, but that doesn't drink himself. He enjoys his party in his own way, even if half the people there don't even know him.It's later, though, that Gatsby reveals his true desire: to be with Daisy again, a woman he acclaimed he loved five years ago, and that she loved him back. But things don't go as smoothly as he desired. Daisy's married, and he's not just looking for her to say she loves him in front of her husband, but to prove that she didn't love that man, not even when they got married. But she can't do that, she can't lie like that.And Gatsby's struck by the truth: that he can't go back to the time where he felt pure, safe, loved. That he desired for something, for his golden years, that he won't be able to return to.And one thing is constantly emphasized: that even all those who seem to have it all, don't.It really shows humans as we are: greedy, always wanting more than what is given, even when we reach our goals, we try to reach further, run faster. And the infinite to return to our own golden years, where we felt comfortable, safe, even when we cannot, 'cause we'll always ask for more.And the great question lingers: was it really love? or just the desire to return to those amazing days when he felt like he could do anything? Or was it all just a grand gesture of love toward the woman he loved so deeply, he didn't care for another thing in the world?The only thing for certain, is that somebody is always watching, just like Doctor T. J. Eckelburg's eyes."
775,Zachary Davis,"One of my top 5 favorite books of all time. This novel convinced me that Fitzgerald is a master of literature. So many things were going on in the novel, that I wish I had someone to discuss the book with. Since I read it for pleasure, there were no required discussions or essays. I can connect with the concept of moral decay in today's society, because it still is happening. Also, I love the theme of the dying american dream. The way Gatsby never is able to achieve his dreams represents how people can never really change their circumstances, the way capitalistic theory claims people should be able to. I wrote a short essay involving this novel for the giving soul scholarship contest, here it is. F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby has a prominent theme that tells the reader that innate dispositions are what society has stuck you with for life. Just as Gatsby can never capture Daisy, those who are born into unfortunate circumstances and surroundings are nearly never able to create a better quality of life for themselves.America. The home of the American Dream, a belief that anyone can make a better life for themselves pending they follow the rules of capitalism. This pursuit of happiness, requires a strong work ethic, and vast amounts of outside help. However, in a surrounding full of people who have never attempted to make a better living for themselves, where is an individual to learn something of a work ethic? School? Poorer communities result in inferior schooling systems, so often that possibility is ruled out. Tupac Shakur refered to himself as the flower that grew out of the concrete. However, not every flower is not graced with shear talent that will act as a fertilizer. By placing our fellow man in situations such as these, a cycle is created, that is harsh and non-ceasing.I've been blessed enough to be apart of a group who aims to help people who are put in situations just like these. The Run the Race group in Columbus, Ohio aims to stop this cycle, by giving inner city children the influence and role models they need to embody themselves after. So much more than feeding the poor, they are given the tools they need to pursue goals that many of today's members of society are already given from birth.The native surrounding is almost always the one that lasts with people as they go through life. Although Gatsby had a stellar work ethic, and did everything in his power to switch his social stature, society prevented him from doing so. This is the situation that faces so many of our nation, and the world's poor. Groups such as the Run the Race club are needed all over the country in order to fight the caste system that our relentless society has created."
776,Annika Robinson,"F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby” vulnerable nature of wanting to be someone who you're not. The theme of the book is a story between a man who had a rough start in life and wanted to be part of the rich circle. The lesson that this book teaches everyone is that you have to be true to yourself, and not someone who people want you to be. The style throughout the book is set in the 1920’s before the stock market had crash all throughout the nation. The book is told entirely through Nick’s eyes, his thoughts and perceptions of the story.Nick Carraway is a young man from Minnesota who, after being educated at Yale and fighting in World War I, goes to New York City to learn the bond business. After moving to West Egg, a fictional area of Long Island that is home to the newly rich, Nick quickly befriends his next-door neighbor, the mysterious Jay Gatsby. As Daisy Buchanan’s cousin, he facilitates the rekindling of the romance between her and Gatsby.Our main character Jay Gatsby (aka James Gatz) started as a farm boy in North Dakota working for a millionaire that made him dedicate his life to the achievement of wealth. Gatsby later made his fortune through criminal activity, as he was willingly to do anything to win back Daisy. Daisy Buchanan, Nick’s cousin and the girl that Gatsby fell in love with, promised to wait for him. However, Daisy harbors a deep need to be loved, and when a wealthy, powerful young man named Tom Buchanan asked her to marry him, Daisy decided not to wait for Gatsby after all. Now she lives with Tom across from Gatsby in the fashionable East Egg district of Long Island.Tom Buchanan, Daisy’s wealthy husband once a member of Nick’s social club at Yale. Tom is an arrogant, hypocritical bully. His social attitudes are laced with racism and sexism, and he never even considers trying to live up to the moral standard he demands from those around him. This book teaches us that’s it ok to be you and not someone else for a girl you like, but also to make your life how you want to live it by an honest life. It tells you that even if you're rich and throw parties like no tomorrow won’t win back anyone or anything."
777,Sönïa Dhillion,"I did a cheat I watched the movie haven't actually read the book . But I love Leonardo dicaprio so I watched to me it was a tragic tale which starred a tragic fool = Jay Gatsby There's a quote where Daisy says:“I hope she'll be a fool -- that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.” ― F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great GatsbyBut really Jay was the fool an Daisy the player , he pit his heart on line, his passion , determination and dreams . Where he created a Tag mahal (metaphorically speaking) for her because he thought that's what she needed , that she left him because he didn't have money and her husband Tom got her for that reason but she still loved him. But no the tragic truth is she was a bitch that thought she was all high and mighty , it was game for her.What I find admirable is how did Jay survive when he didn't have Daisy , or any true friend ? When he was working hard to create that American dream. Who was there for him , who did he speak to when he missed her so much that he felt he couldn't breath?""You see I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad things that happened to me.” ― F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great GatsbyHe was among strangers and he forgot but did he truly forget? You know when the bad point comes when your in a crowd full of folk but yet you feel alone ."
778,Mariel,"I thought about Daisy's little daughter a lot after finishing The Great Gatsby. I felt sorrier for her than I ever did for Jay Gatsby, in terms of winning or losing Daisy's love. They leave the little thing alone while they jettisoned to those fancy parties and trips... That made me feel really sad. (No, I don't blame Daisy for what Gatsby saw in her. It could only be the hard way because she was the physical representation of all his desires, for everything good and bad in life. No one can stand up to that.)Pretending, longing for that bright light on the other side, not owning up to what you have to own about yourself. This book got to me. I read it in my younger days when I hated myself unbearably muchly, and wanted to be anything at all that wasn't me. (I'd watch other people and think ""They have it better"", when they probably didn't. Closer inspection I'd see that but that painful pining feeling still hurt. I could relate to Jay Gatsby sometimes. It was mostly just feeling lonely because it was painful to think about what was going on in those days.) I didn't take it as a picture of America so much as something more personal than that: how we view ourselves and the avoiding of that viewing. I envy anyone who can see some big community/country view. I'll read books about that and long for that same ""I'm a part of that"" connection. The ""great American novel"" means nothing to me, I don't feel bullied into required reading either (at least there is that). So, non-issue for me. I love The Great Gatsby 'cause it is an unflinching personal look into a person and I don't have to take it as statement ('cause I wouldn't). No one can make anyone feel anything. It's all caught up in how we feel about ourselves."
779,Zainab,"I chose to read this book for my English lit wider reading. Its an amazingly well written book. What I love about this book is that there are several things going in but because of the way F.Scott Fitzgerald writes it its so easy to understand, it really flows nicely."
780,James Schubring,"Yes, you had to read The Great Gatsby in high school literature class where your teacher enthused about it long enough to turn its sweeter attractions crabbed and sour. It's worth reading again -- and enjoying this time. Teachers of literature like to offer it up because it is reasonably short, well-written, and full of twists and turns that should keep adolescents interested. A showy life of the idle rich, Jazz age parties, romantic obsession that doesn't slip to the erotic or pornographic, a series of unremarkable events that lead up to tragedy. At the center, a mystery of a character who dies for his obsession, killed because he walked into a vapid culture he didn't understand or plan for.It works off old patterns, the same one used by most of the great love stories: a boy loves a girl but isn't established enough to keep her, he does well in some war or illegal venture, and he comes back for her, fighting through enormous odds to get her. (The core of the basic beginning story of The Count of Monte Cristo before disaster struck there, parodied in The Princess Bride to great success.) We, as readers, have seen all the variations of this pattern. But Gatsby is different. Our plucky boy hero comes back from his illegality with a ton of money, but he doesn't search out his girl directly. He begins throwing lavish, ridiculous parties a few miles from where the girl lives with her new husband -- he wants her to come to him. He wants the grand romance of it rather than the squalid lying that happens when he does begin an affair with her. He wants to keep her forever rather than the summer diversion she makes of him while telling him it will be forever. He wants to live happily ever after, rather than what does happen to him as a result of some careful words spread about by Daisy's husband, a man defending what's his in the most feudal way.""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy -- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clear up the mess they made...""Gatsby's obsession wins him what he wanted and lost him everything. All his shining, glittery parties work and fail him. We read him because of the depth of who he is and how he's defeated by the shallow woman, the villain of this unhappy tale, he so wanted. There was no master criminal. Just people who act from short-term plans, from desires so ordinary the worst that should happen is unhappiness or loud arguments. But the bodies stack up in this tale, fatal accidents give way to misguided revenge plots.The Great Gatsby possesses no good people and no pure bad people. It's a bunch of flawed specimens tossed into a fishbowl to see what they might do. Nothing good is the answer. That is art, but it also demands your attention, tempts you with beautiful words before it rips away your illusions. It's good writing and a great story, a sad one that soared toward happiness for a brief moment before it came crashing back to earth."
781,carl,"Okay, its classic, see? I gave it 5 stars, but honestly all I wanted to do at the end of this book was put a gun in my mouth."
782,Kortney McPherson,"So glad I reread this! I was motivated by the release of the Luhrmann film to reread but it takes a second (or third or fourth or even fifth!) read to really catch some of the minute details of Fitzgerald's style. I would love to give it another read and, hopefully, delve more into it once I get the chance. "
783,Will,Re-read again - so worth it!
784,Babatunde Din-gabisi," The Great Gatsby is a book written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. This book was originally written around the early 20th century. The book has positive and at the same time negative effects on the society. The Great Gatsby shows the good and also shows out the bad rooted deep in the hearts of human beings. The book has several impacts on the audience which will last on for a long time. Even though this book has negative effects it also has positive effects embedded in it. The negative impact it has on the audience is the corruption of the American Dream. In the beginning Gatsby is man with no money and was really ambitious of making money.He gets so blinded by luxury and his possessions that he does not realize that money does not buy happiness or love. Here Fitzgerald demonstrates how someones dream can be shattered on ones focus on acquiring wealth, power and other necessities. We can see how he waste a lot of money hosting parties just for quite foolishness “They’re a rotten crowd…. You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together” (Fitzgerald 162). A positive impact of The Great Gatsby is the urge that it gives you for striving for success and wealth. In the Great Gatsby money means everything. With money you can have anything absolutely. It is the lightning firewood that starts up the American Dream. Nowadays we can see how money is essential for human survival. Without money no humans can go nowhere in this world. Money also buys you class in society.  Also another positive effect it has on the audience is patience. With patience you can always go quite far in the world. Patience is always the best virtue. Because Gatsby was patient he was able to fulfill his heart desires and get back unto Daisy. He physically met Daisy even though they did not make it to the very end. Patience led us to many things we hold on to right now. With patience we had our independence and with that we are enjoying a free country with all the facilities and amenities. The Great Gatsby always had an impact on the lives of the people and will continue to have such effects. The positive impacts on the audience include the urge to bring up your economic and social status by acquiring money and the virtue of patience. On the other hand it has negative effects of corrupting the American Dream. On an overall basis the Great Gatsby will continue to have lasting effects on the people and society as a whole. "
785,Erin,"This is my favorite novel as far as the classics go. This was my second time reading it because the first time it was for English class in high school and I didn't really pay it any attention. I'm so glad I re-read it because I absolutely loved it the second time and gave it 5 stars. (view spoiler)[My favorite things about the book:-Gatsby's parties. This quote pretty much sums it up: ""In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars"". - The time period. The roaring 20's seemed like a great decade to be apart of. All that I can think about is flapper dresses and jazz music.- Fitzgerald's Character development. Nick Carraway was definitely my favorite character in the novel. He was very witty and some of the things that he said in the book made me laugh out loud. Tom was my least favorite character. He was misogynistic and a hypocritical man who thought it was okay for him to run around with other women but when he found out about Daisy and Gatsby he would not stand for it. Also the fact that he threw Gatsby under the bus to Wilson which in the end got him killed. Daisy was a very needy character and was smarter than she acted or gave herself credit for. And then there is Gatsby. He was full of misconceptions and mystery. He was so in love with Daisy and would do anything to be with her but she just left town and didn't even make it to the poor guy's funeral.Things I didn't like:-Daisy not showing up to Gatsby's funeral and in the end staying with Tom- Nobody showing up to Gatsby's funeral. After he threw all those parties and random people would stop by but no one had the decency to be there for him at his funeral. SAD!Can't wait to see the movie! Baz Luhrmann is a genius. I can definitely see Leo in Gatsby's role <3 (hide spoiler)]"
786,Ottery StCatchpole,"So like wow.Yeah, this book is seriously old, its seriously short, and its seriously so far removed from the modern age, but its not.Its a beautiful piece of fiction, The Last Tycoon is supposed to be Fitzgerald's greatest literary achievement by some critics, and I will have to try that book soon. I'm not fond of unfinished novels, I tend to not read them, Dickens and Capote come to mind, but The Great Gatsby is such a brilliant book I think I will have no choice in the matter.To begin, I remember the story fondly from High School. I tend to remember the books I read in school rather very fondly as a lot of them have shaped my views on life. The classics really are classical for a reason, I found out. And on rereading this I found so much I had not known as a kid. For one, that Fitzgerald was such a beautiful writer. His style and prose are lyrical, and like Hemingway it is short and taut. I don't think he wastes a single line in his book, which is so different from what's popular in literature nowadays. No long winding sentences and stream of consciousness tirades that deviate from the story. This is the love story of Jay Gatsby, giving us his invention, his short life, and the end. A terrible tragic end.The feminist in me wants deeply not to hate Daisy and lay this all on her, and I don't, Tom was as much to blame and Gatsby himself the consummate American and representative of the American dream. But I see the figure of Tom's lover as a tragic figure too, trapped in her sad life with Wilson, a victim of circumstance and her own bad decisions. There are I guess no heroes in this story, everyone has something to be sorry for or ashamed of, even Gatsby. His sin I think was thinking that he would win, that he could win it all. And I have to say, I do leave this book hating Daisy a little. She killed him, as surely as Tom did. Both of them reprehensible people who always leave the mess for others to pick up.That said it is a very modern American novel and it stands the test of time very well. We're dealing with the same kinds of problems, abject wealth, social climbers, dreamers, crooks, the entitled, honorable fools. All the characters that populate this novel still populate the great American landscape. We're still committing the same sins and we're still finding ourselves in the same tragedy. A tragedy elegantly written in eloquent prose by a master stylist. It is a pity how little has changed in the American landscape but it is a gorgeous piece of fiction that deserves to be read with a new critical eye and is deserving of being discovered by more people.A truly beautiful work of fiction, it is a small book that illustrates how a keen eye, and short, concise story can oftentimes say more about so many things than the most long winded epic books being written today."
787,Erik,"This book is amazing. Utterly and completely amazing. Many have said it's the perfect book; I don't know if I'd go that far, but I have no doubt many authors are severely jealous of Fitzgerald's masterpiece.As you read this book (assuming you read widely and actually comprehend what you read) you may notice a few very important things: that elements of the characters can be seen in other, more contemporary books; that the story gives the characters a dimensionality that few authors have achieved in books five times as long; and that the story is absolutely timeless, easily ploppable in any time era without feeling even slightly dated. I was prepared to be bored when I read this book, but instead I was pleasantly surprised, even shocked, by how good it is. "
788,David ,"The Great Gatsby is a wonderful work of literature that explores the bright shining myths and darkness of the roaring twenties in the United States.The world was changing fast, technology had arrived to make life easier for millions. Many young people of those times felt launched into a new world of possibilities and hope. Others might've felt bamboozled by shams and hucksters using all kinds of cons to rob them of hard earned money. The United States was then a country on the trajectory of greatness. The American Dream of happiness and wealth was strong and seductive.The Great Gatsby isn't just a story. The beautiful style of writing and graceful choice of brevity is an experience to enjoy for itself. I made the mistake of neglecting to read this until after the recent movie adaption by Australian director Baz Luhmann. Movies have to do different things to achieve a similitude of the authors ideas. I was fairly impressed with the movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio and feel it stands as a good effort. The book however has more time to explore nuance, personalities, moods that shift powerfully and believably in lyrical notes. The small chamber orchestra symphonic structures used in the prose is not the same volume or pitch as the huge budget blockbuster cast humongous symphony orchestra style of the movie. This is as it should be. I hope there's many young people who will read this book before they see the movie. The messages and meanings of the story in writing and reading The mastery of Fitzgeralds work is worth it."
789,Eric,"This is my second reading of The Great Gatsby. I first read it in high school, and I realize now that I did not fully appreciate all that it had to offer.What I enjoyed most in my second reading was Fitzgerald's frequent juxtaposition between opposing forces in the book: old money versus new, the rich versus the poor, New York versus the Valley of Ashes, East versus West; the list goes on. In all of these things though, the author illustrates some great equalizer that touches all, regardless of location, status, or wealth.I also further comprehended the symbolism offered in the novel. What struck me most were the eyes of T.J. Eckleburg which can represent so many things - a failed ""American Dream"", an overseeing morality, the eyes of God. That last interpretation I enjoy the most, for it shows rather plainly that in the eyes of God, we are all the same, and all people, regardless of wealth or status, experience love, pain and suffering, or morality in much the same way.If you've never taken the time to read The Great Gatsby since you were first ""forced"" to read it in high school, take the time to go back and give it another go; I sure got a lot more out of it."
790,Nurul,"Wow. I hardly know where to begin. To say that I loved this book would be an understatement. As soon I was past the first chapter, I thought to myself: ""Yes, this book deserves at least three stars. I like it already."" And then it got better and better and better and I thought: ""Well. Five stars it is!""Fitzgerald's prose is beautiful and effortless and nothing like his good friend Hemingway's (whose style of writing I can never quite appreciate). I just want to quote all the lines and I can never resist a great story with a great ending, punctuated by a great line.Bless this greatness."
791,T.O. Munro,"Two people and one imperative made me read this book. The first was my daughter who had studied it for A'level and having watched the film wanted to discuss it. The second was a colleague who quoted the book's final line at me when a decision of mine sent her department back to a high dudgeon within the building that they had a few years earlier and with some relief escaped. ""And so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."" The imperative was my fast receding ambition of reading 42 books in this year and the Great Gatsby had the huge advantage of being a short (171 page)book more a novella really. It turns out that my daughter had seen the film to completion but read bits and pieces of the novel, such is the cherry picking nature of A'level English literature these days, and even the Great Gatsby, consumed in a few days by the side of Lake Garda, could not put me back on reading track. However it is a great book, one that deserves its tag of classic. I have long felt that a measure of artistic genius is economy. The great artist paints in a single brushstroke an image that draws you in. The great writer in a few well-chosen words conjures a vivid scene within the hollow O of our heads. Another measure of artistic talent is whether something makes you think, whether the story stays with you turning over and over in your mind after you have put the book down, whether the picture captures your attention in a new and different way every time you look at it.The Great Gatsby, passes both those tests. Each scene is brief but necessary, events off stage are alluded to by the passage of time in which we can assume Gatsby's rekindled love affair with Daisy is proceeding as these things do while the narrator Nick Carraway tries to ingratiate himself with Jordan's senile aunt. There is a sparseness to the dialogue, snatches of speech, isolated quotes which give the whole the genuine feel of a young man reminiscing, picking out key memories.There is comedy too, deftly described. The scene where Gatsby contrives to coincidentally call on Carraway at a time when by scrupulous prior arrangement, Carraway has invited his cousin Daisy for dinner is a delight. The transparency of Gatsby's angst, the gardener sent over in the pouring rain to cut Nick's lawn so it will be just right. (Whoever cuts wet grass, let alone grass on which is actually raining?) Gatsby with his hands his pockets, a desperate bit to quell his agitated fidgeting that reminded me of my own pose, hands clasped behind my back (in fact behind the chair) during one of many unsuccessful interviews. (I must have looked like I was being interviewed by the Gestapo). And the naivite of Gatsby who can tell it is not going well but needs Nick to tell him that Daisy is as embarrassed as he.It is beautifully written and, in its way reminded me of another classic whose title seems particularly resonant. Great Expectations, which I was forced to read for English O'Level long ago and from which my enduring impression was of Miss Havisham, the jilted bride still in her dotage wearing her wedding dress within the dusty remains of her forsaken wedding breakfast. What struck me there was the grand waste of such a life lived on a fragment of memory, trapped in the past like a fly in amber. But there was a magnificence in that waste, and Gatsby carries a similar single minded obsession, an inability to move on from the past.Gatsby's greatness lies not in his wealth, his entertaining, his shady dealings, or even his self-invention. Gatsby's greatness is in the focus with which he brings all his considerable resources to bear in a bid to recapture a butterfly moment of happiness in his past. A belief that you can not just revisit but also recreate the past.There are modern resonances too. Since first ""friends reunited"" and then ""Facebook"" came along social media has been a means by which to find not just new friends but old loves. How far would Gatsby have pursued the easy option of a sending Daisy a facebook friend request if that had been available to him? My eldest daughter who, unlike the A'level English literature student, had read the whole book did not like it. The reason she gave was that there were too many unlikeable characters and indeed there are deep flaws in almost everyone we meet. Fitzgerald paints a picture of decadence, arrogance and self-interest. Gatsby is flawed, fatally flawed. But the other central characters, Tom and Daisy are far from virtuous. While Tom's bristling arrogance in the way he treats others is clear through his infidelity and the simple fact that he breaks Myrtle's nose, Daisy's flaws are less obvious. At first we might think her the victim in a loveless marriage, but it is one she walked into of her own accord lured by money such as Gatsby never seemed likely to possess. The money insulates her from real life in a way whch enables her to play at everything, at marriage at parenthood at friendship, at love, yet always thinking that they can be dropped at an instant. In this she shares more with her husband than with Gatsby and that, in the end is why she cannot leave him. It is Carraway who must play the part of Nanny and take her lover away, just as her briefly glimpsed well behaved daughter is taken away to the more parental support of her Nanny.And Gatsby, for all the perfection he imagines in her, still tries to lure her to him with an ostentatious display of wealth and entertainment. He knows money counts for her and that is all right by him it is part of her charm rather than a shallow weakness. She is not just the perfect complement to the lifestyle he has carved out for himself, she is the keystone that completes it. Or rather, the person he imagines her to be is that keystone. A cynic once said that ""The person one loves never really exists but is simply a fantasy of the heart focussed through the lens of the imagination onto the screen which it fits with least distortion."" So too Gatsby strains for a perfection that is certainly not in the present, and may not even have been in the past.And that is the central theme that Fitzgerald alludes to in the final line of the book, that desperate magnificent struggle to recapture a love that never really existed to burrow into the past as those facebook ex's pursue each other, viewing it all with spectacles so rose-tinted they are almost puce. One wonders too at the timing of the book, written in the 20s when the Great War still cast a long shadow. A war too that Gatsby himself lived through and, in reputation at least, prospered by. How far did Gatsby's infatuation with the memory of Daisy reflect the world's yearning for the innocence of the pre-war days, when everything was at is was assumed it should be and always would be. However, in pursuing the old love affair Gatsby's struggle reminds me of the title of a child's book about a Dinosaur a Dragon who discussed their different origins and summarised themselves as ""No Now and Never Was."" That seems to describe the love Gatsby imagined Daisy had for him, but it is his single minded pursuit of that vision which earns him his epithet of Great, an adjective which the book also richly deserves. "
792,Zach Banaszak,"I really enjoyed this novel. There were so many mixed elements that gave a profusion of combatting emotions. The love triangle, violent arguments, loneliness, hope and the twist at the end all provided huge bouts of emotion, contributing to the value of the story. I took away first and foremost that love is precious and should not be tampered with for any reason. Also, I learned two things of hope. Hope is a great force that can push you forward into great success as long as you keep on those goals and dreams. Lastly, hope is also a destructive force if pursued too greatly, as when things begin to fall south of what you hoped for, you become broken and it seems all life can fall away around you."
793,Briynne,"In my humble view, the Great American Novel. Or, one of the great. "
794,Anthony Eskridge,"¬¬¬	I would definitely recommend reading The Great Gatsby not only because it is a good book, but because of the background and history it has. This book is set in 1920s; the Jazz age is what F. Scott Fitzgerald called it. This is at the time modern partying is began, Jazz and musical geniuses start being discovered (hence the name Jazz age), and we learn from history that this is also the post WWI age. I will try to not make this a summary, but simply an explanation of how this is a great piece of literature and the Author achieved his goal and purpose for writing this book; He is trying to help us see how the Jazz age really was, while telling us a story with an interesting plot line. The narrator of the book, Nick, goes to his neighbor Jay Gatsby’s house parties. It is here that Gatsby often called some of the finest musicians of that time to his house to perform. In fact, both Gatsby and Nick are veterans from WWI. Its details like these that help us understand and appreciate how the Jazz age was.In addition to great information about the Jazz age, it also has a great plot line. Although the book is told from the eyes of our Narrator, Nick, the main focus of the book is mainly on Gatsby. It’s a great story of a man’s quest to make it to the top no matter what stands in his way. It also explains the effects of the war on its veterans and how love never dies. I don’t want to go into detail about the details of the book, but if you have never read The Great Gatsby, than you don’t know what you’re missing!"
795,Everyday eBook,"In 1925, in its younger and more vulnerable years, The Great Gatsby was a far cry from the commercial success it is today, almost nine decades later. The year the novel was first published, only about twenty thousand copies were sold. Today, nearly half a million copies of The Great Gatsby are sold each year. What was once -- as a journalist for the now defunct New York World once put it -- ""F. Scott Fitzgerald's latest dud,"" is now widely considered his finest work and accepted as one of the great American novels.In the inaugural episode of [Stephen] Colbert's Book Club, director Baz Luhrmann attested that every generation deserves its own adaptation of The Great Gatsby. Yet, time and time again, the adaptations are panned. All except, perhaps, the Public Theater's staging of Gatz, which presented the book in its word-for-word entirety over the course of seven hours. Of the tremendous display, The New York Times' Ben Brantley gushed, ""The most compelling love affair being conducted on a New York stage this season isn't between a man and woman. (Or a man and a man, a woman and a woman, or a boy and a horse.) It is between a man and a book."" In the wake of several preexisting adaptations of the classic text, Gatz imaginatively and appropriately called for a return to the original source material.""I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in the vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.""What Gatsby, and all of the adapters of Fitzgerald's masterpiece, never realized -- and what we must -- is that what we're trying to grasp is already behind us, everything else is just the pursuit of the unattainable.

796,Simon Wong,"Just a short reflection of my reading English novel.I wish I will rewrite and develop it into a full length one.*** *** *** The name of the novel always has its way to get on your ears, along with its fame; casual mentions in comments of columns, book reviews, or even music, JAZZ, of course. Me not except. But the real attempt of diving into it delayed till the late spring of this year. A little copy of the novel in English was found in the bookstore shelf. I bought it at that noon, immediately. Then, I get to realize that to read the original is a brave try for people like me, who has not yet nurtured a habit of reading English novels. If the effort is big in the language part, it must be huge in the zeal part that is essential to keep your mind on the constant heat to drive the literary mechanics in its delicate and dynamic process, which, particularly, works in Fitzgerald's case. So the course of reading the novel became separated and serrate, developing into a kind of self-discipline; you know, the reviews of book, music, and even movie, currently, are still on, murmuring to your ears the name of this very novel, successfully serving as a strict reminder of my laziness or, precisely, the lack of that zeal. However, once I thumbed open the pages where the bookmark rested in between, it was always demanding to make ends meet in plot or the characters' names. I don't want to ruin it. It is the The Great Gatsby. But I failed to realize that it was not one indulgent decision that was made, but a serial of. In the early time of working on the novel, as long as I found myself rusted in the story, I would retreate ten pages back or directly to the beginning of the chapter (which at most is TWO). Till now---- the whole expanse of summer along with brief autumn passed with no contributions to the thickness of the pages I've successfully read----when the novel was resumed and eventually on a smooth tempo, I began to thank the early time of repeating pages. The first two chapters have been seasoned for me, and luckily sharpen my taste of the beauty and flavors technically weaved in the text. Now is the last chapter, which I will witness as the tragic curtain falls. Well, little can I comment before another reading is done, which, as many other have emotionally claimed, is not far enough. But the happiness is real. I am now inch-away from completing a literary journey of a well-written novel, and the zeal that is required to have books of the like seems seeding in my veil:)"
797,Writer's Relief,"THE GREAT GATSBY is one of only a handful of novels that has really created a lasting impact on the world of literature. Set in 1922 on Long Island, New York, THE GREAT GATSBY follows the memory of Nick Carraway, a young man from the Midwest looking to make a career for himself in the bond business. Upon moving to fictional West Egg, Carraway rents the house just next door to the titular playboy. The suave, sophisticated, and mysterious Jay Gatsby becomes a friend to Carraway and invites him to the lavish parties he throws regularly at his mansion.The novel follows Carraway throughout the summer as he becomes more captivated by Gatsby’s world. The two form a bond that proves vital later in the summer, as Daisy Buchanan, Carraway’s distant cousin and Gatsby’s former lover, enters the fray. The backdrop of the “roaring” twenties and era of prohibition proves the perfect setting for this literary classic.Deemed one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century, THE GREAT GATSBY does not disappoint. F. Scott Fitzgerald manages to ensnare the reader from page one and delivers a world so wonderfully dangerous, one cannot help but be swept away. Considered by most to be Fitzgerald’s magnum opus, THE GREAT GATSBY is the perfect portal through which to move back in time to an era so full of gratuitous excitement, scandal, and jazz."
798,Diane D.,"I just finished (re) reading this book to discuss with my book club. If I had to pick one word to describe it, I think I would use ""tragic"". It is not a lengthy book, but I think it packs quite a story and a clear message. I would recommend this highly to a few acquaintancs of mine with my own message - it's easy to find 'friends' when you're riding high, but will they still be around if your situation changes? It was a delightful coincidence that my book club read this over the summer, since the timeframe of the book is set in the summer months. "
799,Eleri96,"I had to read this book as part of my English Literature course when I was in high school, and I honestly thought I wouldn't enjoy it, as it technically I was being made to read it. But I was surprised at how much I loved it. I think myself and a friend were the only two who read this book for pleasure. As in every book there are characters you hate, and there are a few in this, but overall it is one of my absolute favourites, and even though it's only 9 chapters, there's enough plot for double the chapters. Even if you aren't a fan of reading, this is a good one to try! "
800,Dominick Porreca," This novel was well written, and full of twists and turns. It is set in the roaring twenties, in New York. There are many different characters in this book there is Daisy who is married to Tom, Myrtle who is married to George Wilson, Jordan who is friends with Daisy, Nick who is a cousin to Daisy, and Gatsby who is very mysterious about his life. There is a large amount of conflict in this book, adultery, dishonesty, fidelity, I mean take your pick, the list goes on and on. Even though there is all this conflict there are a few people who don't do as much as everyone else, and those people are Nick and Jordan. They are the only two who create very minor troublesome decisions. Now they may know about certain things that are going on in the house holds of these married couples, but I believe they do not want to say anything to the spouses, because they might not feel that it is their place to voice their opinion. Now I really liked this novel, it kept me on my toes on what might happen next. There was somethings that I could not predict to occur next in the events that followed, but Fitzgerald really knew how to keep things happening to the characters to keep me involved. However the book did start out rather slow, if you can make it to about twenty pages in, then you should be twist and tied into the story of their lives. There were a few things to dislike about this book, but you need those things to make sure that you can understand the characters' lives much better. People who would want to read this would be the ones who like dis functional family stories. Others might find it interesting because it is about the twenties and have some detailed ways they lived in that era. However I believe that everyone should pick this book up and at least try to read half of it before judging it. I am gonna be honest I probably would have never read this if it weren't for my English class that I had to read it. "
801,Robyn Groth,"For me, this novel is about the choice between chasing after your dreams long after they've passed you by or moving on from your dreams, but always ruefully looking back at them. It's about the downside of being practical and the downside of being romantic. It's about how you can't have it all, and if you try, you'll ruin what little you could have. In Austen terms, you can have Mr. Collins and yearn for romance or you can elope with Mr. Wickham and want for means, but Mr. Darcy and Bingley are pure fantasy.In Flaubert terms, once you've married an ordinary doctor, you must resign yourself to avoid affairs and frippery, or the end will be tragic."
802,Pixie,"Maybe it was because I read it immediately after seeing (and loving) the movie. Which, I am deeply ashamed at myself for even having taken so long to pick up this book in the first place. And let's not mention that I went and watched the movie first to motivate myself to read it. I just didn't expect to be so WOWED. But I was. And I'm in love with this book. And the movie. And the time period and fashions. Just... wow. I don't know what to really say. How can a book be so short and so amazingly full of a story at the same time like that? Really? I pick up these books that will take a better part of nearly two hundred pages before getting to the depth with no satisfying conclusion to be near yet, but this just hands it all to you in barely two hundred. I often have a hard time finding gems like this for me. Book- Check.Movie- Check. Both to be favorites for a long time. (P.S. Now that I have read the book, they couldn't have picked a better Gatsby with Leo. Of course I love him and I'm probably biased. He was brilliant. I couldn't imagine anyone else.)"
803,Dwight Lawrence,"I just finished reading this again for the first time since high school. In my view, this book is the very definition of the Great American Novel.The first thing that strikes me is the fact that all of the characters are simply revolting human beings. Tom is a racist, cheater, and woman beater. Daisy is simple and incredibly superficial. Note the fact that Gatsby's expensive shirts bring her to tears, while she only mentions her daughter once in the novel. Jordan Baker is a gossip and serial prevaricator. Myrtle cheats on her husband, but frankly doesn't even attempt to conceal it. In fact, she rather flaunts it in his face, but he's to stupid to realize it for most of the novel. Our narrator Nick Carraway witnesses Tom cheating on Daisy, Daisy cheating on Tom, but never for a moment has a crises of conscience and even contemplates informing the unknowing party.And finally Gatsby. Though he is a liar, criminal. and possibly murderer, he's the most sympathetic of the bunch. In reality, he's simply an insecure man, who feels that he needs to be ""better"" than what he was born into to deserve the love of a woman. He just goes to extremes to make himself worthy. "
804,Briks,"While most people have read this in their younger lives (High School, College, etc), I never had so I decided to give it a shot with the movie coming out soon. It's much shorter than I had guessed, and was a quick read. It took me a little while to get used to Fitzgerald's writing style, partially due to the different use of language at that time. Once I did though, the book became very enjoyable. Books can be enjoyable in many different ways though, so using a star rating system can be a little limiting. I mean, I can read a Nelson Demille novel like ""Plum Island"" and really enjoy it and maybe give it 4 stars, while also giving ""The Great Gatsby"" 4 stars based on enjoyment level as well, but I fully understand why the latter is regarded as a classic and the former is just a solid book that no one will really remember. ""Gatsby"" is memorable because of the big picture ideas, for it's themes. I'm sure there are better critics than me who can appreciate Fitzgerald's prose a lot more than I can, but to me Gatsby was enjoyable for what it represents more than for the plot, or dialogue or anything like that.There is a scene in ""The Wire"" where Deangelo is in a prison book club and gives his take on ""The Great Gatsby"", and the takeaway is that Gatsby's life is similar to his own (or maybe even more accurately, Stringer Bell's) in that you are who you were in the beginning, not who you pretend to be. And I do see that in the book. But at the beginning of that ""Wire"" scene, another prison inmate gives an even better synopsis in my mind. He mentions how Jay Gatsby gives everything for Daisy because he thinks of her as special, and in the end, she was no different than any other girl. I think that is my takeaway from this book more than anything. In the ""The Great Gatsby"", it is Daisy, but the idea doesn't have to be limited to a woman. The idea is that anything that we build up so much in our mind will always disappoint in the end. The chase and desire itself is the most valuable thing, and once he was no longer longing for the ""green light"" and Gatsby was left with Daisy herself, his life lost it's purpose in a way. He held her to an impossible standard and disappointment was the only possible ending. I have a feeling that this book will have a lot of staying power in my mind, so I'm giving it the 5 star review even though my actual enjoyment level during the reading was probably a 4."
805,David Fleming,"THE GREAT GATSBYIs there any better book out there than the Great Gatsby? Not for me. I know we're all taught to believe that this is The Great American Novel but, for me, this truely is the current title holder.The lyricism and dignity of his prose are at the utmost in this short novel. I’ve read the first several pages again and again in awe and envy. Darn you Fitzgerald! Darn you for being so talented! How did you do it? Why is it so rare and fleeting? Someone once asked me at a party what my favorite novel was and I replied, ""The Great Gatsby"" and they said, ""Oh, yeah that book about corruption."" This is not a book about the corruption of wealth in America. Fitzgerald wrote about that a great deal but this story is about something more. It's about a theme so pervasive in the mind's of Americans that it is easily missed by the casual reader. This book asks the question, Is the American Dream Worth It? This question can, at once, lead to both petty and noble feelings. "
806,Austin Catania,"The truth about The Great GatsbyThe Great Gatsby a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald has thrived in the hearts of Americans since the beginning. It’s the 1920’s, every day is living the dream, and more and more people are becoming breathlessly rich. Nick Carraway, a young man of Minnesota opens a new chapter of his life and decides to move to West Egg in New York. West Egg seems out of this world, the perfect place for nick to live, it’s close to family and soon the famous Gatsby. Nick serves as the narrator throughout the novel and also the intermediary between the reader and the frivolous life of Jay Gatsby. He takes readers through the lack of grace or the heart of the newly rich, therefore creating the setting of the 1920’s. However since Gatsby is so wealthy he throws parties upon parties for what seems no apparent reason other than that he can. Although there is one specific reason that he throws so many parties and it is to get back her ex-lover, Daisy Buchanan, Nick’s cousin. Gatsby’s true love for Daisy is revealed throughout the novel to the readers. However this love turns out to be the downfall for Gatsby in a few ways. For instance, Daisy’s love for him was not enough, for Gatsby demanded that she stated that her love for Tom never existed. In addition since Gatsby loved Daisy so, he took the blame for the accident that happens late in the novel. While life seems to be at its highest, Scott Fitzgerald skillfully gave subtle hints to the decay of the American dream and wealth in America. At this time the decay of wealth was unheard of yet sadly right around the corner. Through Scott Fitzgerald’s writing we have gained a fantastic specimen of literature. Throughout the novel, F. Scott Fitzgerald portrayed unrequited love in a flawless manner. Through the vivid imagery the reader gain a fantastic portrait in their minds. Overall I give it a 5 out of 5, for it was extremely enjoyable."
807,soulswear,"I think the Great Gatsby is one of the greatest books ever written. The way Jay Gatsby is portrayed by (in the beginning) a complete stranger has me fascinated by him. He is living the imagination of himself. He dreamed of what he might be able to be and he became that person. It is unclear to me if he actually is that person though, or if it is just a facade he puts up around himself to protect himself.Also I feel like the most underrated treat of Gatsby in this book is his unlimited kindness. He gives things out for all the people in the world but never asks for anything back. To me Gatsby in an absolute inspiration on how people function. By building this illusion around himself he creates this little bubble of peace within him, but still never is totally satisfied. This constant striving for happiness and self-fulfillment is shown so nicely in this book and so unique too."
808,Jessica (Books: A true story),"I don't know how I made it through high school without reading this classic, but I'm so glad I get to come back to books like this and read them as an adult. I'm sure I would have learned stuff in high school, but I feel like I'm getting more appreciation out of books like this as I get older.The only thing I knew about this book before I started reading was that it was a shallow love story that ends with the girl dumping the poor, innocent guy....or something. And yes that is the plot, but I think the story can also be about the American dream and who it's really available to. What is the American dream? Is it just getting money and it doesn't matter how? Did we really get away from social inequality? I hadn't really thought about any of that before reading this book. It made me wonder what my American dream is. Do I just want to get lots of money, a big house, and tons of stuff? Or is there more to it than that? Without spoiling the end, I feel like Mr. Fitzgerald's opinion on the matter is that some people are born to live the American dream and some aren't - and there isn't much you can do to change it. The fate of Daisy and Gatsby really brings that tragic idea home.The parties were unreal. I was drooling over the mention of all the food. I couldn't help but imagine the Dowager Countess from Downton Abbey coming to Gatsby's house and being appalled at what Americans called ""a dinner party."" My mind was buzzing with all the practical details and sheer amount of money that it would take to feed two dinners and tons of alcohol to that many people... But the parties and glamour are just covering up the fact that most of these people are shady, immoral, hypocritical and just plain unhappy. Especially Tom and his wife Daisy.I loved the writing. It was simple, charming, and witty - an interesting contrast to the much deeper story going on. The last line about how we can't escape from the past points out that even though as Americans we say that anyone can achieve wealth, happiness and equality, the truth is we keep getting sucked into the rules of the past.The only thing I thought was overdone was the symbolic Eye Doctor bilboard in the ash valley. Don't let the symbolic Eye Doctor Ad/God's Judgement fall on you on the way out.Overall, a novel that got me really thinking about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in the context of a beautiful, tragic, and romantic story.This book is also reviewed on my blog Books: A true story"
809,Anneleen,A classic for a reason.
810,Lesley Korzennik,Greatest American novel. And I'm not alone on this.
811,Parikhit,"If there’s one book that can creep into your system to find a permanent place it has to be Fitzgerald’s ‘The Great Gatsby’. I do not know how but I was under the impression that the book was about the Great Depression. But surprisingly, apart a lingering depression, there is no connection. Amidst all the glitz and glamour, amidst all the merry-making and joyfulness there is a turbulence of crumbling dreams. It is the 1920s and money and power are all that matter to tower high in growing America. It would be wrong to suggest the book does not echo love; yes, there is love but is marred. Nick Carraway deciphers Gatsby and narrates a tale of infidelity, of anger, of the unpleasantness concealed by layers and layers of gaiety. Jay Gatsby conferred upon himself this name and also conferred a destiny that brought him earthly pleasures sans the joy. He is the potentate of a rich empire, throws lavish parties but remains shrouded in mystery. The only motive was Daisy, his love since five years. While he leaves to amass fortune, Daisy marries the rich and self-absorbed Tom Buchanan. Gatsby only surfaces years later and then begins a terrible turmoil, a struggle leading to a destructive end. The Buchanans form the very core of the destruction and remain true to what Nick Carraway mentions of them, “they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made”. There are the Wilsons who witnessed the wrath of the storm that the Buchanans conjured and haughty Jordan Baker. Apart Nick Carraway and Gatsby there is no likeable person. But Gatsby, too, was blinded by a lethal obsession, mesmerized by Daisy.‘The Great Gatsby’ through dysfunctional lives and beautiful prose cruelly exposes the nightmarish truth in the American Dream or largely the dream we all have been nurturing. "
812,Billie Pritchett,"This is a great book to reread. The lyricism of the writing grows easier to appreciate and the romanticism of Nick Carraway and Jay Gatsby grows more apparent. The lyricism of the writing effectively conveys the romanticism in picturesque ruminations and scenes. The book has felt different to me every time I've read it, and I think it mainly has to do with my responsiveness to its worldview and its hopefulness. This hopefulness bit is difficult to describe. It lies somewhere between a yearning to recover the past and to rescue the future with some vision or other. It's a very reflective novel, and the characters in it are alive and viewable, warts and all.Update: Reread Saturday, 6 June 2015F. Scott Fitzgerald is truly the great American novel. It's about a man named Jay Gatsby who is chasing a 5-year-old dream of a woman and a romance, a dream which far outpaces reality. The book also serves as criticism of America during the 1920s, and perhaps down to our own time, when wealthy people lived excessively and without fear of hurting the poor to continue their chosen lifestyle. The book is at once timeless in its quest for a long-lost dream and historical in its shining a light on American opulence."
813,Syed Jamil,One of the most amazing I have read! Powerful prose.
814,Patrice,"Excellent depiction of the rich and famous in American society during the 1920's. It was required reading in high school and I haven't read it since, but my take-away was, as I recall, a feeling of nausea from the debauchery, alcohol abuse, and collective superficiality of that time."
815,Charles Blanchard,"The Great Gatsby – Discipline of CraftsmanshipThe Great Gatsby, along with Gone with the Wind and The Grapes of Wrath achieved something quite rare in the world of literature. They all defined an era of American history. In the case of The Great Gatsby, one of the greatest novels of the 20th century, it defined the America of the 1920s. Published in 1925, this book has never gone out of print. What makes this book live on for so long? Why is it still taught in the classroom? Why does it not appear to be dated? The answer is the carefully constructed prose that fills each and every page of the book. It reads like a piece of music. It is lyrical in both tone and substance. It is also about the romance of power and money. This resonates today and will never go out of style.The story is told in the third person. The narrator, Nick Caraway is a young clerk at a banking firm who has moved from the Midwest to NY to try his hand at making it big. He has rented a small cottage in a fashionable village of Long Island, called “West Egg” in the novel. This location, a place of quiet natural allure and the other village called “East Egg” is reminiscent of the North Shore villages of Long Island, Kings Point and Sands Point, respectively.His neighbor is and is not a contrast to the mellow, self-effacing Caraway. Just next door, separated by a vast lawn of carefully cut grass, is the estate of Jay Gatsby, a shy self-invented tycoon of sorts, who throws lavish parties on the lawn, never shows his face to many people and who secretly Caraway admires for his incredible success. It is summer, and this is the setting for a majority of the novel.In a way, it is also partly autobiographical. Fitzgerald came from the Midwest as does Nick Caraway, the narrator. And since Fitzgerald was writing about his contemporaries of the present day in the 1920s, it is worth noting that he knew at least partly of the kind of life that is so richly described in this book. Gatsby is a powerful man with few friends but many associates who help him get things done. Soon after, Gatsby invites Caraway over to one of the parties and is introduced to him. There is a purpose for this. Nick is the cousin of the other main character, Daisy Buchanan, whom Gatsby was engaged to years earlier. Gatsby’s main purpose is to rekindle the romance with Daisy by asking Nick to ask Daisy to come over to Caraway’s cottage so Gatsby can meet her there. Kind of convoluted but it is fascinating how Fitzgerald’s natural talent at storytelling and his keen eye for dialogue and descriptiveness is what makes the novel endearing, even if the characters themselves are not.For example, this is a passage that describes how Nick feels about Daisy’s singing. “Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again. When the melody rose, her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.”Another passage describes an early encounter between Gatsby and Daisy, years before. “His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lip’s touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.” Daisy Buchanan is by nature a very loving person, who speaks from the heart, but she is selfish and immature but without a streak of meanness. Her husband, Tom Buchanan is very well to do. He rides horses and is very aggressive in his likes and dislikes. He is also condescending and interrupts Daisy when she is speaking so he can have his say. The characters in this novel are fast living and afraid as they approach middle age and they are all disillusioned about life. Idle gossip is the norm as the characters swelter in the heat of summer.This novel appeals to both men and women because in every scene men and women figure prominently. There is nothing is this novel that is archaic or that would even give the impression that it’s about the 1920s. It is to Fitzgerald’s talent and sheer hard work of rewriting until it was right that every scene is suggestive of thought and mood by characters that at the core are superficial and ignorant of anything beyond their pursuits. They want to have a good time regardless of consequences. They can be wild and sassy beasts, full of rage and bliss.Gatsby is a wealthy private man with romantic speculation. Caraway on his lunch hour walks down Fifth Avenue and imagines himself as boyfriend to the various women who pass by, living a better life, maybe a life like Gatsby’s.There is the need to be accepted by improving one’s social position; afraid of going to the poor house. Perhaps this was Fitzgerald’s personal aim in life and it is the wariness of inventing one’s self to fit in that is dramatized on every page; a desire to belong to that special group of snobs but never really trusting any of them. The morale of the story is that money and position do not last. It is the dream of obtaining it and never giving up that is attractive.This novel is a masterpiece of literature where style surpasses everything else, including splendidly invented characters."
816,Torrie,"I strongly disagree with all of those who say that this book has no deeper meaning, or they couldn't find anything in it. And to those people that say it was bad - I'm sorry, but if you think this was bad then there is no way that you can appreciate good writing. Even though I was technically 'forced' to read this in eighth grade, I went crazy over it. Even now, when I think of it, I sort of melt inside. I have a soft spot for it. It is amazingly written. Throughout the book I have highlighted passages that are spectacular. This book gives insight, and if you look hard enough, it can change your life. I have read it numerous times, annotated and discussed all the true meanings of everything that happened in this novel. The Great Gatsby is now one of my favorite books.The reason that it is considered one of the Great American Novels is because of the underlying theme of the American Dream. Everyone in this story is seeking the American Dream - the ability to rise from nothing and to achieve wealth and happiness. The two main characters Tom and Daisy seem to have achieved this dream, but in reality they are slowly breaking apart. They are careless people that can do whatever they want just because they have money. Meanwhile, Gatsby also seems to have the American Dream because he has risen from just being James Gatz to a multi millionaire. However, all he really wants is Daisy. Both of these people try to go back to the past, which they learn is impossible - and it has consequences. And in the end, Daisy is able to escape from all of her problems because of the high standing that she has in society. Her carelessness and selfishness pulls people down, but she just keeps going. I highly recommend for everyone to read this novel. But please, please do not read it literally. You have to imagine yourself in Nick Carraway's house, looking out at the mansion with the freshly cut lawn. You have to see that green light blinking at the end of Daisy's dock and feel the separation that has been tearing Gatsby apart for years. F. Scott Fitzgerald makes this possible through his writing. All that's left is to experience this amazing book."
817,Chris Simon,"A perfect novel. It has everything, characters, story, plot, sound of the words...I love everything about that book. "
818,Kurt,"I'm not sure what elevates this novel above other well-crafted stories with interesting characters in a dreamlike setting, but I love it more every time I read it."
819,Lindsey Jenkins,"I love these old classics. This was a very romantic story which in our time, Gatsby's take on romance would come off a little creepy and stalker-like. Ha ha. It was also about heartbreak and about having the courage to get what you really want out of life."
820,Walter Alves,"The Great Gatsby is a masterpiece. How unfortunate it is that the American school system includes this book in its middle/high school curriculum when it demands a much older audience. The reason I say that is because this novel scrutinizes complex human relationships like marriage, extramarital affairs, jealousy, admiration, love and friendship. It’s frighteningly realistic and comparable to the real world (something most people don’t experience until they’re done with compulsory education.) The themes in this novel are just as realistic today as they were in the 1920’s, which is probably what makes it so compelling. It’s easy to imagine yourself in one of Gatsby’s lavish parties and, in spite of all his generosity, hear others criticize him and put him down. This is the kind of novel that revives every cynical sentiment one can have. By the last page, you’ll be thoroughly convinced that the human race is hurtful, stoic, and selfish. But also let it be understood, through your own emotions, that we’re capable of sympathizing and, like Gatsby, still able to overlook all the repulsiveness to go after our hearts' desires.Read the first two pages after you’re done with the book and you’ll understand it all. Gatsby made it, he was just stifling in sour air."
821,Ryan Desanto,"I only began to truly appreciate this novel after I watched a documentary on F. Scott Fidzgerald's life. This is when I saw the true brilliance of his writing, especially how Nick Carraway's inner monologue actually directly depicted Fidzgerald's views. Fidzgerald was once denied marriage on the basis that he was not wealthy enough or even in the same class. Nick Carraway's depiction of how petty Daisy was when chosing who to marry, showed Fidzgerald's own frustration. My primary takeaways from this novel are: how love can ultimately destroy one's personal aspirations, how unfairly petty many people were in the 1920's and the importance of having ""true"" friends."
822,Jared Millet,"From the ""Better read the book before the movie comes out"" Dept.:Absolutely loved it. And the great thing about reading the classics as an adult is that you don't have to write a book report to spoil the fun. I'm sure there are many other reviews with much more profound thoughts than I, but suffice it to say that I was shocked what a fun read this ""important piece of literature"" and ""great American novel"" actually turned out to be. 1) I love a good mystery, and it's got that. 2) I love Shakespearean plot mechanics, and it's got that too. Not to mention that it's all a perfect time capsule of the 20's - the last decade in which America could take itself seriously and have a blast at the same time."
823,BookKace,"The Great Gatsby is a wonderful classic. There are many evidences of symbolism in it, such as the eyes of Dr. Eckleburg on the bill-board. According to several online sources, the green light on the end of Daisy’s deck is also a strong symbol. It represents Gatsby’s dreams, but also the unknown future. The light cannot be reached. It is an “unattainable dream”. There are multiple themes, such as man vs society and man vs self. The book displays the extreme luxury and cavalier attitude of the rich just before the Great Depression. The book almost tells the author’s, F. Scott Fitzgerald, life story. The main character almost seems to realize how ridiculous and frivolous the times are, but he goes along with it. F. Scott Fitzgerald lived a life similar to that and ended up dying at a young age due to complications with alcoholism. To some extent, perhaps Fitzgerald realized what a shallow life he was leading and wrote about it. The Great Gatsby is a fantastic, meaningful historical novel. "
824,Teresa,"I love this novel.People go into this expecting a sweeping love story, or something extremely serious and then bash the novel for being trashy or stalkery. I think this is because when someone says a novel is a ""classic"" we think they mean stuffy and because people take their english teachers too seriously.At heart this is a soap opera, albeit more intelligent and meaningful then the ones on TV but it's still a love story full of foolish rich people playing stupid games with each other and it's still incredible because Fitzgerald gave us the most level headed character as narrator and slips serious social issues, morality questions and philosophical questions. I found that the tabloid level drama and vapid wistful rich people balanced out with the overall meaning and questions behind the story. As for the romance element, I never thought the reader was meant to see Gatsby as a great romantic hero, he's clearly a quixotic, pathetic, tragic fool who needs a hard slap in the face. Looking at it any other way makes the whole story weird and changes the meaning entirely.I highly recommend this if you want to be more well read but don't want to dredge through hundreds of pages of ancient classics, if you have a love of history, an interest in the 1920s or like me have an overly romantic heart."
825,Julia Stewart,"I was very apprehensive about reviewing this novel, as I do not feel that my words will do it justice. I genuinely fell in love with reading, after having read this book. It is a magnificent work of art; i will be reading and rereading this book for as long as I can. Fitzgerald came up with a relatively average story line, and transformed it into a vibrant plot with elaborate characters who all seemed to have very rich back-stories. What he created with his typewriter was, in my opinion, as good as or even better than what Picasso created with his brush and paint. The whole story screamed colours and lavish lifestyle and extravagant parties and music and sex and it was sheer beauty. I simply cannot explain how wonderful this novel is, you must read it. No matter whether you hate classics or you haven't ready any of Fitzgerald's work, you simply cannot miss out on the opportunity of experiencing the magnificence of this book. Everything about this was good! The plot, the characters, the ending! I cannot express my love for this novel enough. Just read it!"
826,Rowena,"The first time I read this book, 3-4 years ago, I gave it a 4-star rating. I don't re-read too many books these days because my to-read shelf is drastically out of control, but I have been thinking about why ,in the case of this re-read, I enjoyed it more the second time around. Perhaps it's because I now focus equally on the writing style techniques as well as the plot, perhaps because I am already acquainted with the story and the character, I can focus on other aspects I missed the first time around. In any case, I really enjoyed this book and I'm looking forward to discussing it this evening with my bookclub."
827,Susan (the other Susan) ,"""... and we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."" What else is there to say? "
828,Lyn LeJeune,understanding American Character....there's no book like it
829,Jenny Blounts,"I'm teaching this book right now and am thinking again just how infinitely teachable it is, especially to a heterogeneous grouping of students. The students who struggle a bit with reading are totally engaged by the scandalous story line and are able to pick up on the more overt symbols and motifs, and the students who need the extra challenge are left with no shortage of rich language and more embedded themes and devices. The descriptions are lush enough of that all students can immerse themselves in the story, but not so tedious that they get bored.There's a reason this book endures...I've read it MANY times, but still get chills when Gatsby says, guilelessly, ""Can't repeat the past? Why, of course you can!"" or when Gatsby kisses Daisy for the first time and ""forever wed[s:] his unutterable visions to her perishable breath"" or any number of other moments. Not to mention, as recent events illustrate, its themes still speak to us: after all, it is not the reckless and powerful and privileged who suffer when times get tough; it is those who have, with great hope, invested all they have into the American Dream who must feel it crumble beneath them, but who continue to ""beat on, boats against the current""...

830,Andrew Wright,"The Great Gatsby is a book about America. I can't think of another book more about America. If you ask foreigners what they most identify as American traits they refer to our optimism, our cheerfulness, our lack of sophistication, our utter naivety (which is just the flip side of optimism) and our youth, that incredible newness of our country, and its obsession with newness. These are all pretty much traits we can associate with Jay Gatsby, right? Look at the car he drives (Fitzgerald uses symbols so well to further develop his chief characters), it is ultra-sleek, ultra-modern, ultra-new. Compared to Tom's very conservative car, Gatsby's is down right gawdy.And that's what we're supposed to get from this book, gawdiness versus conservativism, new money versus old money. It's about America, which is to say it's about money. It's about money and about class struggle. Part of the American naivety is that we've all been sold on this myth of the American dream, that if you work hard and make money, you can accomplish anything and completely remake yourself. Jay Gatsby remakes himself as thoroughly as he can, and yet he still can't become the one thing he has to become in order to have the woman he loves-- he can't become old money. Nothing will change that. Gatsby survived WWI and the criminal underworld, he grabbed life by the horns and took control, and yet, this one thing, time and history and social class conventions is utterly beyond his control, which means Daisy, love and happiness are beyond his grasp. If you don't know what it's like to have part of your life, part of the emotional fabric of your soul, completely beyond your own control, then you haven't really been out in the world that long. It's what dealing with other people, loving and fighting and living, is all about.The characters can sometimes seem unreal. They're made somewhat grotesque in order to stand in for ideas and archetypes greater than themselves. And yet, in a lot of ways I recognize Daisy and Tom and Nick and Jordan and Jay as very real people. Tom's racism and his infidelity seem very real symptoms of the sort of entitlement, coldness and closed-mindedness I've seen other real rich bullies demonstrate. Daisy's insistence that she hopes her daughter grows up to be a fool seems terribly real to me, the only moment when Daisy is real to me. Have you honestly never met a woman who went along with life's script, with what she was told she had to do, even though it made her unhappy? And when you met that woman, was there not some sort of deep reservoir of conflict that only revealed itself in little hints of recognition and pain? I can't even get started about the scene with the wedding. And what about her relenting and eating fried chicken with Tom? This is a real, albeit very weak, woman. Jordan's cheating at golf, her hypocritical insistence that other bad drivers are the problem... these seem like great details that make her both an effective representation of some larger personality group and a more real person on the page. There are too many details. I don't know that this book has a wasted a word, a word that doesn't contribute to the reader's greater understanding of the people on its pages.The Great Gatsby has something that Fitzgerald's other books don't have: a really tight, cohesive plot. Fitzgerald almost has a Jane Austen or Tolstoy type plot in this book, in the simple sense that everything happens for a reason. In a really good novel's plot nothing happens out of the blue. All of the action of the story is driven by the characters and their motivations. In the Gatsby, in the development, climax and resolution of all its conflicts there aren't loose ends, there aren't things happening for no reason. Jay meets Daisy... that's the only loose end, that is the one trick fickle chance has to play in this story. After that everything Gatsby, Tom, Myrtyle, George and Daisy do is guided by their circumstances and their psychology. Because of her upbringing, Daisy had to leave the poor soldier and marry the rich Tom. Jay had to try, in spite of his upbringing, to make himself the man Daisy could marry. Tom had the car to sell so he met George and Myrtle. He had the upbringing to be selfish enough to take Myrtle and to string George along so he could keep taking her. Daisy's weakness, her inability to defy her upbringing leads her back to Tom, which leads to her killing Myrtyle (how heartbreaking this must have been for Jay! This act on Daisy's part just screams that she still cares about Tom, despite his infidelity and in spite of Jay's committing an entire life to her!) in a scene that is just perfectly written (again with the cars as symbols) so that George has to mistake the whole situation and think that Jay was the one to kill Myrtle, which in turn leads to Jay's death. And it all ends up so pointless and sad, which is sort of Fitzgerald's commentary: The rich people, the old money, they all end up fine in the end. Tom and Daisy stay together and end up fine. George, Myrtle and Jay all end up dead because of Tom's hatefulness and selfishness and Daisy's weakness, while those two are buffered from misfortune by their money. I can not think of a more perfectly constructed plot except for Anna Karenina.I feel like Fitzgerald's symbolism is pretty strong. The cars, the shirts, Gatsby tapping his foot in the hotel, that damn green light. Yadda yadda. But let's get right down to brass tacks.No writer in the English language has written prose as beautifully as Fitzgerald. Let's examine the last three paragraphs of chapter 6 of the Great Gatsby.. . . One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees — he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder. His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete. Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something — an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever.I can't think of a more ringing endorsement for a book or an author. Every honest writer in the world is aspiring to craft sentences like this."
831,Riley Peek,"What a beautiful, beautiful novel. I'm not sure if I'll write a full review on this one, so I might as well do it on Goodreads rather than the blog, and beware of spoilers. Also, a note about my reading time frame for this book. I technically started it July 27, but that was while I was on vacation, and that copy belonged to my aunt and I couldn't bring it back with me. I had 90 pages read on vacation, and finished the last 100 pages up in about 2 days now at the end of August. Okay, so on with the review! Can I just start out saying that I love Jordan Baker? I mean, I don't know if I'm supposed to or whatever, but I love Jordan Baker. Maybe I just loved her from the perspective of what she did in the story, and that was serving as the romantic interest for Nick, but also this fascinatingly enigmatic woman. I think that she was such a brilliant character, and while many may not pay much mind to her, I think she was amazing, and I perked up a bit more when she was in the story than when Daisy was. Which brings me to my next point. Throughout the story, I was pretty annoyed with Daisy, and her method of handling things. Looking back, I understand the whole concept of her not really being in love with Tom, and that's the reason that she indulges in Gatsby (partially), and I do respect her, but I suppose I went into the story with the mindset that I'd love Daisy Buchanan, and I was disappointed a bit with her character's choices. The way she handled situations was just so off-putting to me, but I suppose it does make sense. Gatsby held no real significance to me, to be honest. I feel like the story revolved around Tom, his acknowledgment of all the respective relationships around him and how they were co-existing, and his experience alongside the lifestyle he was entering. Gatsby was there, oh yes, but he seemed like more of a looming presence, almost like a reflection of Nick's conscience, if that makes any sense. I loved Nick, really. I thought he was such a respectable, true character, and he had his flaws, and he knew that he did. He was such an amazing man to read about, and his story will forever stick with me. I understand, now, why this book is so respected and admired, even though my review may not be the longest and most reflective of my emotions towards this book as an entity. I understand the attachment one may feel to this book, for I felt it as well. The Great Gatsby is a treasure, and it will remain that way for ages to come."
832,Ayushi,"Fitzgerand's storytelling is poetic. No, seriously! So, what happens when your neighbour is a drug dealer? Narrated from the viewpoint of a very keen observer, this book serves heightened delight of some unadulterated literature.And, of Fitzgerald I am a fan now."
833,Eugene Yu,"This was, by far, the most sophisticated novel I've ever read! It was a hundred and eighty pages of pure pleasure! I love the way it was written , i could smell the roaring 20s, the culture was astoundingly rich and i could really feel every character's contribution to the story, the plot was mind-blowing and irresistibly delightful and at some point i literally had to stop and slowly digest everything . This was a story of love, disdain, idealism, decadence, tragedy, opportunity,....it was everything that you want to know about that time, and clearly the author was at his best! The prose was outstanding! , i don't know how the author managed to intricately condensed all of his wonderful thoughts in one heck of a small book. Jay Gatsby is a character, i'll never forget , which to me is the quintessential essence of the tragedy of the rich and famous. Lastly , i would like to see the movie versions which hollywood had revived several for the last 8 decades! so many...i think everybody wants to showcase their version of the story!"
834,Joabany Carreto,"I read this book called ""The Great Gatsby"" by F.Scott Fitzgerald. This book took place in the 1920s people were separated some in the east egg and some in the west egg. The characters are Tom who lives in east egg with Daisy and Jordan the house guest, Gatsby lives in west egg but then moves to east egg because he wants to be closer to daisy and then their is Nick the narrator who is daisy's distance cousin.Gatsby meets daisy at a dance and they talked to each other and saying that they want to get married but Gatsby says no because he has to go to war and does not know if he is going to come back alive. thats when Gatsby tells daisy to wait for him till he comes back. daisy could not wait too long so she meet this rich guy named Tom and end up marring him because of his money. Now that Gatsby came back she does not know what to do.I think this is a really good book because I like the way the author tells the story and how everything is very specific. Some of it was pretty hard to figure out because it went way into detail.I think people should read this book because its really good and has lots of information. I think that really like romantic books or things that have to do with two people that are trying to get back but cant because one of them has gotten married."
835,Lona Brunton,"Read this the first time in college, and needed to read it again, as I am teaching it to my American Perspectives Literature Class. What a great representation of the 1920's ... excess, social climbing, reaching the Big American Dream - and wondering where the happiness was in it all?? It is a great book to really analyze on a deep level. The characters are complicated, color is embedded into the characters and setting (which one could analyze in a whole myriad of ways), the settings are telling and thought provoking. Last summer I read ""The Paris Wife"" and it was an excellent preview for re-reading The Great Gatsby, offering some insight into the life of F. Scott Fitzgerald, who played a minor role in tht historically based novel. I do think though, The Great Gatsy is also a good novel to read just for the beauty of the language and the story ... it doesn't have to be over analyzed to appreciate. "
836,Erica Zimmermann,"This is one of the few books I have the desire to reread every few years and it never disappoints me. The language is stunning on first or third or tenth read. Line after line of the text is memorable as hell. The story is fascinating and tragic, whether you like all the characters or not. On some level, I feel complete enjoyment of the novel depends on whether or not you can identify with Gatsby's (stalkerish?) pursuit of Daisy. Has any man ever gone to such lengths to impress and attain a woman with whom he only spent a month five years earlier? But it isn't purely for Daisy that he made himself into someone important; toward the end of the book, Gatsby's father brings an old itinerary Gatsby made for himself when he was a teenager. Even at that young age, he was focused, ambitious, and obviously intelligent. Daisy became another goal he needed to strive for, his green light at the end of the dock. And yet, I never doubted for a minute that he loved her.Nick Carraway is a wonderful narrator and this year I decided to give an audiobook version, narrated by Jake Gyllenhaal, a try. I loved it perhaps even more than reading it on the page; the language really comes alive when you hear it spoken, and Gyllenhaal's narration made me wish they had cast him (instead of Toby Maguire) as Nick in the recent film adaptation. There were maybe a few inflections that he didn't hit quite right (I ADORE Carey Mulligan's interpretation of the line ""Gatsby? What Gatsby?"" in the film), but overall his voice was melodic and the slight modifications he made in performing the parts of each character had just the right amount of subtlety.I truly believe this is the Great American Novel, at least of the 20th century, and will debate to the ends of the Earth anyone who says otherwise."
837,Samantha Lee,"This was one of the books that I've heard so much about, but never really considered reading at first. Then the movie came out, and I heard about how good the book was even more. My interest peaked even more when I saw a list of classic novels. I then decided to borrow it from the library. It took me some time to get through, due to the heavier language, and the fact that it's so different from anything else I've ever read.I found the perspective very interesting. I liked how Nick WAS affected by the events, but not directly. He was friends with Daisy, Tom and Gatsby, but he wasn't exactly involved in the events, other than his friendship. I could relate to this, and I suppose in that way I could sympathize with his character. However, I didn't find him exactly... interesting. He's not a bad character persay, I just don't find him particularly striking. While this probably sounds predictable of me, Gatsby is the one I feel the most empathetic towards. His home, himself, and his lifestyle is shrouded in mystery, but at the core of it, he's an average man. He loves Daisy so deeply, but in the end, she betrays him. Even if Tom was the one to send Wilson to his home, she sparked the chain of events that lead to the ""hollocaust"" as Nick puts it. Also, the fact that he was completely willing to take the blame for Myrtle's murder... jesus. Poor Jay. He gave so much to people, hospitality, a good time, his home, and what does he get at the end? A funeral in which only Nick attends. His only friend.Overall such a tragic story, but one I'm so glad I read. "
838,B-zee,"Entah kenapa saya pada akhirnya memutuskan untuk membaca buku ini sekarang. Tiba-tiba semua tampak seperti kebetulan. Kesimpulannya, bahwa kenyataannya, kita semua sendirian.Awalnya saya merasa latar belakang Nick Carraway (sang narator) dijabarkan terlalu detail, hingga Gatsby yang menjadi judul dalam buku ini tampak tak terlalu banyak porsinya. Namun ternyata, kita memang diajak untuk memandang Gatsby dan hidupnya melalui sudut pandang Nick. Dari situ, berbagai hal tak pernah sama lagi.*nangisdalamhati*Complete review: https://bacaanbzee.wordpress.com/2015..."
839,Sean Pritchard,"In A Confederacy Of Dunces, the striking stand out is author John Toole’s knack for capturing and releasing the flaws of common man to the common man, makes for a perfect read. The story of Ignatius J. Reilly, and the people he affects daily is told in the novel “A Confederacy of Dunces” by John Kennedy Toole. Set in 1960's New Orleans, Ignatius is finally made to get a job after a series of family financial crisis.His complete lack of a self motivation and determination leads him to Levy Pants Company as an assembly worker for his first true job. After getting fired from this job, Ignatius was forced to move on to finding another so he can stay living at his home. He looks for the easiest and laziest job he can find and ends up working the streets of New Orleans as a hot dog vendor, where he eats more that he sells. Toole is said to have worked in the French Quarter as a tamale vendor, giving him a basis to write about. Ignatius meets ridiculous characters along the way such as Dorian Greene, a rich, jolly, and oddly mannered man who is quickly persuaded by Ignatius to become part of a new political party thought up by Ignatius made up of homosexuals. This being another example of one of the running themes/stereotypes of the book.Eventually Ignatius’ mother becomes so peeved with him and his inability to care for himself that she has began with accusing him of being a “communiss”, and has began to talk about his problems with her friend Santa.During the time that all these events occur, a subplot is taking place set at a downtown strip bar called The Night of Joy. One of the workers catches on to illegal activities are occurring and plans to put an end to it. Meanwhile, an officer at the local police station is being made to wear a unique and embarrassing outfit of the chief’s choice every day as his punishment for doing a poor job and arresting innocent people. Myra Minkoff, an old college friend of whom Ignatius is very fond of, exchanges letters with him describing each’s present life situation, and also critique each other’s philosophical ideas. The two finally end up meeting up together at a party, where Ignatius is assuredly repulsed by the characters in which Myra has befriended. As the story progresses, many odd and unusual qualities that reveal themselves about Ignatius Reilly. The reader comes to learn that while Ignatius is an amazing writer, he will only write his masterpieces on big chief tablets with red crayon for an unknown reason. Likewise, whenever Ignatius is stressed or angry, he has intestinal problems that make him become uncomfortable and bloated. Ignatius finds non carnal pleasure in things such as honesty and friendship, values that he is deprived of. Toole turns and uses these points to ironically criticize and point out many stereotypes that are becoming rampant in the 1960's.“A Confederacy of Dunces” was sadly almost never published. Months after he completed the book, Toole drastically committed suicide, and not until many years after his death was this book sent to a company by his mother, in an attempt to have it published.This novel provided the flesh and bones that most novels of American Literature lack and was a joy to read."
840,Shaun,"Am rereading this book for the fourth or fifth time presently for the Second Tuesday of the Month ""Gentlemen's"" Book Club. We are debating at present the phrase ""great American novel"" and this ol' Bad Bear keeps coming up as the quintessential American icon; in fact, Studio 360 did a review of this classic with that very idea in mind.To even be considered a great American novel, it must have a unique American ""voice"" with themes that transcend time. Thus far, this would fit the bill. Is this one better than the Great ""Moby Dick""? Stay tuned my good and true gentle readers. We meet again in three weeks to debate the point. The jury is still out ...."
841,Angela Kingston,"Some of the sentences in this book should be framed and hung on every writer's wall. Beautifully nuanced characterisations and descriptions, a convincing and compelling plot. What else can I say? Hats off to F. Scott."
842,Liwi88,"The Great Gatsby is one of the most famous books of all time for a reason. It is not only a thoughtful account of life in the gilded age but also a story of love and purpose. All this is held together by Fitzgeralds vivid and captivating writing style. Overall, a beautiful book."
843,Brian Murray,"Having read it in one day on my first read, I was absolutely captivated by the story and these characters and the language. I could not love a book more.I decided to reread this upon an urgent need of Fitzgerald's advice. This time I will say I did not find as much joy as my first read, which was on a cool day at the start of my summer break. Of course, I couldn't think of a better environment to read it in than that, so that's that. But on this read, while less joyful, I found a much more human and empathetic tale in the engrossing story I fell in love with last summer. Fitzgerald laces his prose with romanticism, but he doesn't cheapen the characters or emotions in doing so. Several times I found his romantic description of a complex emotional state so beautiful, simple, and concise that I would spend the next minute rereading a single sentence.Fitzgerald did not limit this closeness to his language. Upon this reading, I found every character to be much more sympathetic. It was easy for me on my first read to come to this conclusion, ""I feel so badly for Gatsby. Daisy doesn't deserve him. Tom is such a pompous ass for having that affair. Nick is alright and Jordan is cool. And Myrtle...is just stupid!!!"" This time, I found myself feeling for each and every character. I was surprised, for example, how much more sympathetic Tom was than I remembered. Does he have his faults, of course. But he is a human being, and thus has a lighter, loving side to him, a side I did not initially see. I could feel how lost Daisy must have actually felt in such a situation and the immense pressure that these characters put on her.But this book is not named for its flower-named damsel or its reserved narrator. Gatsby is the heart and soul of this book. Every plot, every theme, every idea comes back to him, even if he is not directly involved. Reading it this time, I found Gatsby, the enigma, the facade, the man, to hit closer to home than I predicted. He is not just a flawed character that the author writes to say ""Hey reader, DON'T BE THIS PERSON!!!!"" Fitzgerald finds Gatsby's heart and the self-destructive poison that he keeps there. In doing so we see that poison in our own veins and acknowledge that we have gotten a little to comfortable with its presence, just like that old sport. This, I find, is what has kept what could have been a stuffy novel alive and visceral. Fitzgerald is not criticizing a social class or a perception of morality, but rather a very real and palpable part of the human condition. A part that exists in me, in you, in us all. And rather than preaching, Fitzgerald tells an elegant story, with occasional insight. That, I find, is what keeps these pages breathing and has kept and will continue to keep this story in my heart for a long, long time."
844,Pyone Lei Lei Mon,"My second approach to 20th century literature, after 'To Kill A Mockingbird', and I fell in love with the classics. Really worth a try."

846,Po,"đã cố đọc trước khi xem phim nhưng may là xem xong mới đọc tiếp nên thấy dễ hiểu hơn chút =)) nhiều hình ảnh nhiều câu chuyện núp dưới con chữ quá chưa hiểu hết được.Không hiểu sao đọc xong ra đường lại thấy thành phố nhẹ nhàng khác hẳn.

847,Mayor McCheese ,"Was forced to read this in 11th grade. Now all these years later reread it this summer. If you haven't seen the movie with DiCaprio, don't, he's a marginal actor and reminds me of Alex Rodriguez -- a person who is always pretending to be a real person. Anyway, Gatsby is a charming and sad look at the 20s and I think the main point of the book is probably the stupidity and silliness of the main characters. The author calls Gatsby ""Great"" which his somewhat of a misnomer in that Gatsby does not seem to have distinguished himself in any meaningful regard. Having a lot of money doesn't count for much. He appears to have miscalculated Daisy's character and to spend five years pining away for someone who was arguably beneath him is a sign of stupidity rather than grace. For her part Daisy is a bit two-dimensional, obviously an attractive and charming girl but she doesn't have a lot of character. The narrator himself is a bit stuffy, like an old man talking about how things used to be. Still, somehow this book has become synonymous with the 20s and the feeling and glitz you sense at imagining a Gatsby party has really replaced historical fact in terms of trying to understand what that decade was like. Too bad Fitzgerald was so bananas, would have been nice to have had more from this author. "
848,Allison,"This was a fun and quick re-read before the movie comes out. Too many favorite quotes to post... Fitzgerald is so brilliant at capturing the superficial mess of that era (and now??). The characters are so tragically hollow, I noticed when I put it down I felt relief, and appreciated every little mundane thing about my life just a little more:) Gatsby is just one of the greatest literary characters of all time, in my humble opinion."
849,Jinny Chung,"""But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy's wing.""."" 'Self-control!' repeated Tom incredulously. 'I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife. Well, if that's the idea you can count me out. ... Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they'll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white.'Flushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization.'We're all white here,' murmured Jordan."""
850,ChaosInGa,"Backstory: I know I was supposed to have read this book and was actually graded on (some parts of) it in high school. However, I recalled nothing when I re-read it. i must've read ""notes"" about it in school. (I'm feel so sorry for the former 'me' now.)It is a hauntingly beautiful read. I forgot just how eloquent writers can be (or were, in this case). Saw the movie, which i thoroughly enjoyed, before finishing the book. I, now, understand movie viewers' criticism about the script writers'...ummmm, let's say ""creative licenses"". However, both the book & movie offer lessons regarding life, love, loss, greed, and hope. The movie just offers an abbreviated version. Please read or re-read. An absolute splendid ride. "
851,beth,I first had to read this book in high school and just simply could NOT get in to it. I recently picked it back up because my roomate and I made a deal that we would read eachother's favorite books.I simply loved it. I don't know why but I was taken away with the story. Whatever I hated during my first read I loved during the second.I think its great for the transition into adulthood. I got so much more after going through a major life change than I did when I read it under the eyes of a watchful teacher. Great character writing and illustration. 
852,Gamal Elzahed,"Although this book was above my usual level of reading i really enjoyed it and understood most of it i found that there are some words and sentences i didn't understand but i would just search it up and it would make sense. The book was very touching and it had a very interesting love story which i usually wouldn't enjoy but the way that everything is tied together at the end like the reason Gatsby has all those huge parties just for daisy and the reason he lived across the bay just for daisy. The story has a very sad ending which i was disappointed with because i had hoped everything would work out for Gatsby and Daisy, The story is narrated from the perspective of Daisy's cousin Nick. "
853,CaldoHendo,"I think The Great Gatsby is one of those books that should always be read during the summer. Its central theme is somehow befitting of the time: all our hopes are piled on those much vaunted months of June, July and August. It’s a time of year during which we look forward to being unquestionably happy. Yet if something – anything – goes wrong, it has the potential to poison it all, and bring you down to your very lowest. The Great Gatsby is set during the summer of 1922, at the height of the fastidious and hedonistic era known as ‘The Roaring Twenties’. Other names include ‘The Gay Twenties’, ‘The Jazz Age’ and ‘The Aspirin Age’, but you get the idea. Fitzgerald immediately comes to mind when we think of this time, but then it was not by any means sunny for everyone. Most ordinary people were hit by a severe and protracted trade depression (a consequence of the recent First World War) and high unemployment, and this was before the Wall Street Crash. Without even touching on the rights of ethnic minorities, many woman were still struggling to be heard against the men, although their voices were getting stronger. The novel’s most prominent female character, Daisy, is an arrogant and extremely self-assured young woman. Not only does she torment Gatsby, but has the power to strike fear into the very heart of her husband Tom, an ugly and brutish philistine whose intolerant views anticipate the fascism that was to darken so much of the ensuing twenty years. Further issues on people’s minds at the time, such as the rise of organised crime and the calamitous Prohibition law (two issues more intimately related than many people thought), are really only hinted at in passing. Gatsby, who was rumoured to have been involved in the fixing of the 1919 World Fare, only needs to show his face to a ingratiating policeman in order to have the speeding charges swiftly dropped. This was the era when fast cars were really taking off, although road safety, as Gatsby will later learn, was still a secondary consideration. Very quickly, we begin to realise that the unhappiness and uncertainly underlying the era also pervades every page of the book, and, like the annoyingly dark skies in the middle of July, has the potential to tarnish it all. While avoiding falling into the age-old trap of drawing too many comparisons between the author and his characters, it is nonetheless interesting to consider Fitzgerald’s own background while sifting through the seamless pages of his book. Frances Scott Key Fitzgerald was born in the Midwest in the latter half of the nineteenth century. As the narrator Nick Carraway points out, all the main players – Gatsby, Daisy, Jordan, Tom and himself – come from much the same area. To them the East, specifically the glittering New York City, encapsulated all that was marvellous about wealth, class and fame. Fitzgerald was no stranger to this gay and carefree lifestyle, living for a long time on a West Egg of his own before moving to Europe around the time of the novel’s completion in 1925. He had made it as a successful author with This Side of Paradise, but had lived through an unhappy time before the war. As a young and penniless man Gatsby courted a Southern woman exotically named Zelda Sayre, but he was rejected by her family. Returning from the war, his status as a hero greatly enhanced, he tried to win over Zelda once again (is this reminding you of anyone?). Although they did wed soon enough, Sayre’s mental health issues greatly damaged their relationship. He died believing himself to a failure, no happier that Gatsby.In a way, the author’s tragic backstory does not matter at all to our appreciation of his finest work. Besides, Gatsby’s experiences are clearer cut, his untimely death at the swimming pool being more poignant than Fitzgerald’s long decline, and better suited to highlighting the novel’s central message. To repeat: you can have money flowing out of every orifice, you may be the centre of attention at extravagant parties at your fancy pad on a New York island, you may even get fresh lemons delivered to your door every morning – but you can still be absolutely miserable.Most of us know this, deep down, but it is important to be reminded of the fact every once and a while, especially through such a stylish and carefully constructed piece of fiction. I remember the first time I read Gatsby a few summers ago, and being impressed how magnificently Fitzgerald could capture the subtleties of his characters. How sad and pathetic Gatsby sounds when he defensively insists that the past can be restored. This from a man who, underneath all that ostentation, is obviously shy and insecure. He looks lonely in a crowded room and even when we see him alone, be it gawping hopefully at the flickering green light across the Sound or loitering outside Tom Buchanan’s house in the hope of ‘saving’ Daisy, he seems isolated from reality. Relaying all this to us is the patient and reflective narrator, who somehow knows from the very beginning that the whole escapade is doomed. He stresses his distance from the other main characters, and often tries to remove himself from them when they get on his nerves. Yet he is always dragged back into the drama, partly because of his own relationship with Jordan, Daisy’s closest friend, but also because of his understandably infatuation with Gatsby. The novel’s tragic hero has little appreciation for Nick, of course, and is obviously not around to realise that Carraway turns out to be his only true fried. But alas, that is not the point. Being buried with Gatsby on that wet and windy day is not just all the happiness of the summer, but also Nick’s faith in an era where sadness was never far away. "
854,Noce,"Quando ho letto per la prima volta questo libro, ero al liceo. Mi ricordo che mi era piaciuto tantissimo e che mi aveva lasciato una gran malinconia. Ma all'epoca non avrei saputo dire qual era l'origine di tanta malinconia.In effetti non potevo saperlo. Per il semplice fatto che ero troppo giovane, e ancora non avevo alle spalle un passato significativo. Non potevo dunque immaginare che chiunque superata una certa età vorrebbe rispecchiarsi nelle proprie illusioni, oppure allargare tanto le braccia da poter abbracciare il futuro e farne una leva per ritornare verso il passato. Per riavere certe occasioni intatte, pure e piene di possibilità come se fossero ancora da scartare.Gatsby è un grande. Perché in questa ricerca del tempo perduto ci ha creduto febbrilmente. Non importa che il sogno irraggiungibile fosse una donna che non aveva mai potuto avere. Alla fine impariamo così tanto a voler bene a un uomo che ha fatto della sua vita una farsa nel nome di un ideale, che il suo cammino nel suo personale ""Sunset Boulevard"", per quanto tragico sia, ci trova partecipi, solidali e commossi come il narratore. Ed è solo perché Gatsby potremmo esserlo tutti, ma forse non così terribilmente grandi nella perseveranza di volere a tutti i costi che i nostri sogni più improbabili si realizzino.Volete una prova del fatto che è un libro che alla fine ci riguarda tutti? Ve la do volentieri.Da adolescente ci avevo azzeccato su una cosa. Magari mi sfuggiva la lezione di vita ma in quanto a sensazioni, quelle non sono cambiate. Mi ricordo perfettamente che leggendo il libro mi veniva sempre in mente una canzone della Vanoni che a un certo punto fa così:""Ecco la musica è finita gli amici se ne vanno e tu mi lasci sola più di prima un minuto è lungo da morire.... ""Anche adesso rileggendolo mi viene sempre in mente quel motivetto là.Chi non ha mai provato questa sensazione alla fine di una festa? Bene, allora dovete leggere ""Il grande Gatsby"" perché è il racconto di quell'esatto istante in cui la musica finisce e noi ci ritroviamo seduti su una sedia o sui gradini delle scale, a fare un resoconto che va ben oltre la serata sconfinando nei nostri sogni di una vita."
855,Celeste,"In my younger and more vulnerable years, I was assigned this book to read and I've been turning it over in my mind ever since. But honestly, The Great Gatsby is one of the best books ever written. The language flows beautifully with the message, motif and tone at any given point. If you're into flowery language this is the book for you. Also, a big selling point for me is that the allusions are beautifully and subtly woven into the narrative. Two that I could remember are: one in the beginning, not five pages in, to The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock (also one of my favorites) that read about foul dust in dreams and scuttling along the bottom of the ocean; the other compared Gatsby to an Adonis/Jesus (think Billy Budd) in this just fantastic scene among cherry blossoms. I'm apologize for my poor grammar in the previous sentence, I just get a bit excited when I talk about The Great Gatsby.Fitzgerald once wrote to his wife in a letter that he pours something vital of himself into everything he writes, something more personal than the vital fluids. Nothing is more evidence of his statement than The Great Gatsby."
856,Letitia,"Just a splendidly written novel. Fitzgerald's narrative tone is as perfect as I have ever come across, matching perhaps only George Eliot and Virginia Woolf in my opinion – Nick Carraway impresses us as witty, insightful, upstanding, yet compassionate; not as snarky as Hemingway; not as patronising as Steinbeck; more concise than the Victorian Eliot and Dickens.I heard a professor talk once about the poetry of Fitzgerald's prose, and you can hear the trace of iambic pentameter on almost every page of this book:
""If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the ""creative temperament""--it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.""

""Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.""
As you probably know, I love analysing rhythm and rhyme in novels.(See my breakdown of To The Lighthouse here: To The Lighthouse Review)The Great Gatsby really isn't about its plot. It's one of those books that seems slow and keeps you in the dark and you have to read it once first or maybe get the plot out of the way via the film or Wikipedia, but that second (and all subsequent) reads are mesmerising, some of the most savoured moments of your life. Because The Great Gatsby is about the indulgent atmosphere of the 1920s Fitzgerald brings to life; about the moods and attitudes of its characters who desire and bully and lie and sulk and shirk and erupt. It's about the tragedy of watching somebody struggle and flail with a clock, and let the past eat him alive."
857,Christian Rupp,"This is definitely one of the best books I've ever read. Although it was set during the 1920's I still felt like it was very relatable. It was a great book in the fact that it really showed that even if you have money and are rich your life can still be empty and unfullfilling. It was set during the 1920's and narrated by the character Nick Carraway. Nick had just finished fighting the the first world war and decided to move to New York for the bond business. Despite his wealthy status he tries to live modestly. Nick has a cousin Daisy who's friend Jordan becomes interested in Nick.He eventually meets his neighbor Gatsby who throws very big parties, Nick and Gatsby become good friends. He finds out that Gatsby had previously fallen in love with Daisy and he tries to set it up so they meet once again. Daisy's husband Tom finds out about this and becomes very mad. Gatsby is killed by another man and very few people attend the funeral. Nick is disgusted with Tom and Daisy and leaves for the midwest where he reflects on his experiences. "
858,Audrey,"When I was in high school the powers that be decided that we shouldn't read classics. It's been more than ""ahem"" years and I still do't get that. Anyway, this book was a hole in my wealth of literature until my daughter announced two weeks ago that she had to read it over break. I decided to read it with her, something I do from time to time, and I am so glad I did.Books like this beg to be read out loud. I love the feel of the words as they fall off my tongue, the sound as they tickle my ears and move off through space. And for language this is one of the best I've ever read.I loved the story. I loved the arc of the narrative character. And I loved how nobody was really who they pretended to be. I, like Gil in Midnight in Paris, love the gilded age, whether here or in Paris. It's a fascinating time to be able to peek inside. I'm going to guess that Alan J. Pakula, screenwriter of Sophie's Choice, also enjoyed Gatsby (disclaimer - I can't speak to Styron because I didn't read the novel).Sophie's Choice had the same story arc as Gatsby. The narrative character enters the story green, a naive innocent. He is sucked by proximity into the lives of an odd cast of characters whom he both idolizes and abhores and is forever changed by their downfall. Someone once said that there are really only twelve plots in literature. Everything else is a variation on a theme. I have never been able to decide what I think of that assertion but I dearly love both of these stories so my observation is not a complaint.I only suggest this - when you read a book like Gatsby, read it aloud. It's like sucking on the most delicious piece of hard candy. The taste lingers even after the substance is gone."
859,Mary Kate,"I'm still not entirely sure what I think of this book. It was definitely different that I thought it would be. I had thought it would be a lot lighter, a lot more fun, when in reality it was rather sad. I'm not sure if I really liked it, but it was a pleasant enough read. It was easy; the language was descriptive but not dense. Fitzgerald has wonderful writing skills, and the descriptive narratives were golden. I just had a hard time connecting to many of the characters, and many of the relationships never actually felt like relationships. I never actually felt like there was any affection there (view spoiler)[ except in the case of poor Mr. Gatsby for Daisy, but even that couldn't be a fully developed relationship because she was just fooling around while he was in love.  (hide spoiler)] I almost wonder, though, if I was too young for this, if it is suddenly going to hit me, five years from now, how marvelous this book really was. I had heard such wonderful things, had heard of people loving the book, and it just didn't grab me, not like Little Women, or Anne of Green Gables, or Romeo and Juliet. I don't know. I was slightly let down, I have to say.The cover is gorgeous though! This is my absolute favorite book cover that I have ever seen, I think. I find it incredibly beautiful.(view spoiler)[ Just as a note here, the one part I did find heartbreaking, the only emotion I felt in the whole book, really, was the fact that no one came to Gatsby's house before the funeral. For all his entertainment, for all the luxuries he had given people, only Nick and his father ever really cared. Even Daisy, who I thoroughly resent by this point, never even called. Poor Gatsby.  (hide spoiler)]Okay, I'm adding this bit after I've had a few days to mull this over: I think I don't know what to say about this book because it shattered a notion I had of an era. I had only ever looked at the twenties as a time of leisure and decadence. It never occurred to me the price these things came at. I only thought about the fun of the affairs and never the marriages destroyed by them, only about the champagne at the parties and never the hangover the morning after. It was a lot more serious than I had thought it would be, and so when I finished it, I had the sensation one gets when you take a sip of a clear drink, expecting sprite, and get water instead. That was what this book was. It was water, cleansing and clearing and cold. It wasn't the fizzing, bubbling soda I had thought it would be. But the sadness in it is beautiful, aching. Beautiful, but entirely different from the sadness of a play like Romeo and Juliet. Romeo and Juliet is overly dramatic. The drama is all for the sake of entertainment. This felt real. It wasn't just playing at being sad. It was actually sad, hopeless. It was like watching a car crash. You can't look away, and it's immeasurably heartbreaking, but for a moment, when the cars collide and the metal screeches, it is alluring, until reality comes rushing back, filling you with the desire to help, but you know there is nothing you can do. It's an entirely different thing from anything else I have ever read, and I have no idea how to judge it. I don't think I can thank Fitzgerald for opening my eyes like this. I believe I was much happier in my delusions, but that is the whole point of this book, I suppose. I respect this book, and I can appreciate it, but I do not think, after all, that I can really say I liked it.****************************************************************************************************Okay, this is my review after my second reading of the book, and it was astonishingly different. I really, really enjoyed it this time. I read it with my English class and was thus forced to read it more slowly and analyze the wonderful little clues that Fitzgerald integrated into the story, deliberate details for us to find. Fitzgerald was brilliant. The whole act of reading his book was a game of hide and seek, as we searched for the little notion he hid here, or the symbolism this character held. I feel that when I read it again-- which I won't do for a few years, I think-- only to let myself gain perspective, I will find even more hidden within the pages.Strangely, I did not find it as sad this time, nor did I find the characters as odious. Perhaps because I knew the ending, I was not hit as hard by the weight of it. I did not get the same overwhelming and depressing outlook on all of humanity. This time, I didn't see the malice I saw in the old money characters the first time. I didn't see Daisy as harshly as I did, nor even Tom. Upon reading it a second time, I could see their point of views more clearly, see what they thought about their actions. As Nick points out, they think they are justified in doing all they do. And the novel does not ring as harshly of the death of the American dream, or the pointlessness of hope. The first time I read it, I saw only the fact that the one character left with ambition, with the ability to hope, was met with a terrible fate. It had come across as a message to me, a grim prediction for the future, where no one will be like Gatsby, and we will all be Jordan Bakers instead, with contempt for everything and everyone. But that isn't really the case. It is not a prediction so much as a warning, as a lesson taught. The characters in the novel equate wealth with success, but after reading it, I was struck with a very different definition for success: happiness. If the characters in the novel had equated happiness with success, and not wealth with happiness, it would have been an entirely different book."
860,Denae,"What a wonderful, sad book. Fitzgerald does an amazing job of describing surfaces, yet also giving a detailed, stark picture of a bunch of lonely miserable people. Short, and all the more powerful for it, I definitely recommend this, particularly for anyone who, like me, did not read it in school but is now between 20-30."
861,Aurora,"Ammetto di aver deciso di leggere il libro solo perchè voglio andare a vedere il film. Non conoscevo Fitzgerald e non conoscevo i suoi libri. Fortunatamente mi si è aperto un mondo. Questo libro racconta la storia di un uomo solo che vive ancorato ai ricordi. Durante tutta la sua giovinezza lotta per farsi accettare e quando finalmente ci riesce, tutto intorno a lui è mutato. Le persone sono sono cambiate. Tutti sono cresciuti, hanno cambiato vita, si sono sposati. Tutti tranne Gatsby, che non riesce a stare lontano da ""quella lucina verde"" aldilà della baia. Struggente, romantico e tristissimo. E' impossibile non immedesimarsi in Nick e non rimanere folgorati dal ""Grande Gatsby"". "
862,Roxy Smith,"Who doesn’t want a neighbor like Jay Gatsby? You can experience lavish parties in his New York mansion every weekend, drive around in his fancy cars, be surrounded by his wealth, corruption and death? Gatsby isn’t all bad though, he has one driving force that has led him to his success and that is his love for Daisy Buchannan, she is his motivation, which I think is something many people can relate too. Fitzgerald perfectly portrays America during the “roaring twenties” in his novel and accurately depicts the lifestyles of American’s during that time period. We can see these types of personality traits through Gatsby and his ambition and goal to reunite and rekindle his love with Daisy but also his strive to be successful and his ulterior motive to reinvent himself. Oddly enough, when Gatsby dies few people attend his funeral, which I think is Fitzgerald’s way of saying you never truly know who your real friends are. Although many people can’t relate to Gatsby, I love the opening quote in the book, “Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantage that you’ve had.” It is through this one quote that Fitzgerald uses to bring Gatsby down to the real world and I want to be able to create one defining quote that all of my characters can be described as. "
863,Khadijah Aldabbagh,"""""The Great Gatsby"" is considered by many to be the zenith of american fiction writing in the last century. I won't say that it is the best american novel I've read but I will say it is probably the most perfect.Fitzgerald has got to be one of my favorite writer of fiction. As opposed to Hemingway's bluntness, and Faulkner's artiness, Fitzgerald's prose seems(to paraphrase Michael Chabon) to rain down from style heaven. His style in fact is like the ladies he writes about: cool, lean and absolutely enchanting. He would never dream of overwriting and knows exactly when to hold back for maximum effect. His use of the language is assured and consequently eminently readable. For that alone this should be considered the Mona Lisa of prose.What is astounding though is how he puts his sparsely elegant style to use giving his characters shade and depth. Fitzgerald is a true student of humanity and his skills of observation are razor sharp. He sums up his characters in sentences that read like aphorisms bulging with truth about the human condition. There's not a page goes by I'm not gasping at the depth of his vision and the economy he uses to express it.So far I've dwelt on how he wrote and not on what he wrote. People who'd back another nag in the Great American Novel derby knock Fitzgerald's sophomoric (their word not mine) obsession with romance between men and women. They reduce his works to the level of melodramatic tear jerkers. This is a gross simplification of his talents. Yes ""Gatsby"" focuses on a doomed love affair but it does so to illustrate the errors in thinking that he felt marred his generation. Gatsby is about the hollowness of the American dream as dreamt in the twenties. Fitzgerald looked around him (and in the mirror)and saw men and women locked in a frenzied and ultimatley doomed race for speed, money and sin. Gatsby and Daisy's love is doomed because their values have been distorted by money and comfort and opulence. They cannot see the depths because they are too easily distracted by shiny surfaces. When Daisy cries as Gatsby shows off his elegantly tailored shirts because she has never seen clothes so beautiful sums up perfectly how for her exteriors matter most. This is at the heart of the tragedy that unfolds before us in this delicious little novel.There is no denying this is one of the GREAT BOOKS. If you haven't read it do so. I dare you to not fall in love with it. Rolls Andre """
864,Elyse Griesbaum," Gatsby and all the other characters in the book are either easy to love or easy to hate. Gatsby is a character that I just fell in love with. And there is no return (because you can't repeat the past, old sport).  ""He smiled understandingly–much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced–or seemed to face–the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistable prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey."" Oh. My. Gosh. I absolutely loved this book. I had to read it in my English class this year and usually I HATE the books we have to read. But this one I fell in love with and keep falling in love with every time I read it or watch the movie. I am now obsessed and can't believe it's over. Please-if you have the time-do read it, old sport. "
865,La fille qui rit,"Le pochissime volte in cui mi sono ritrovata a discutere de Il grande Gatsby e a parlarne, si è sempre arrivati alla triste definizione del romanzo d'amore.Penso, invece, che Il grande Gatsby sia molto più che una storia d'amore. Ambientato negli anni '20, in America gli anni del lusso, dello sfarzo, delle super feste e dell'economia che va alla grande, in questo romanzo si tratteggia perfettamente la società del periodo (criticata da moltissimi altri intellettuali), in cui i soldi, l'apparenza e la ricchezza sono più importanti dei sentimenti.Jay Gatsby, a differenza di coloro che gli sono attorno, ha posto le emozioni prima di tutto. Nato povero, è divenuto ricco e ha fatto fortuna, tutto questo per amore Daisy. Era un uomo che inseguiva i suoi sogni e che mai avrebbe perso la speranza. Purtroppo, i suoi ""sacrifici"" non vengono ripagati in alcun modo, e al contrario l'amore viene messo da parte per far passare avanti l'egoismo e la noncuranza. Il romanzo mi ha lasciato tristezza e anche molta rabbia. Rabbia perché nonostante la datazione del libro, è maledettamente attuale, perché anche oggi siamo tutti un po' Daisy.  ""Gatsby credeva nella luce verde, al futuro orgiastico che anno dopo anno indietreggia di fronte a noi. C'è sfuggito allora, ma non importa - domani correremo più in fretta, allungheremo ancora di più le braccia ... e una bella mattina...Così remiamo, barche controcorrente, risospinti senza sosta nel passato.""  “«Non pretenderei troppo da lei.» arrischiai. «Non si può ripetere il passato.»«Non si può ripetere il passato?» fece lui incredulo. «Ma certo che si può!»"" "
866,Adrian,"I re-read it for the film, and it's still pretty much perfect."
867,Aditi,One of the greatest heart warming & heart-touching love story of all times...
868,Nate Kowal,"Having only read The Great Gatsby once - and considering that I consider it one of my favorite books - I decided it was about time I re read it. I was beginning to lose the details and only remember that I enjoyed it.The first thing I noticed was how much I was enjoying it. I think the first time was more of deciphering why this is such an amazing book. I let myself get absorbed in ever word. The dialogue is some of the best I ever read.I remember feeling like the characters were a lot less awkward than mind had originally portrayed them.But what about the story itself? It's a story about, as Nick Carraway put it, how we ""can't repeat the past."" It is about Nick Carraway's less than experienced life and Gatsby's shallow attachment to something that occured five years ago. It's about a summer where perception changed for everyone and where Nick realizes that he doesn't belong in the east.The Great Gatsby is my idea of a perfect book. I get lost in the time when this takes place though it seems timeless. I feel like such an old soul because this book speaks to me. "
869,Erikka,"""The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile...finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run.""""Her face was sad and lovely, with bright things in it...""""...a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words.""""It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again.""""...as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory feeling from me.""Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart....a loud, bright night, with wings beating in trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life....as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering.With the influence of the dress her personality had also under gone a change....the only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone.Absolutely real - have pages adn everything. I thought they'd be a nice durable cardboard.It faced...the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on YOU with an irresistible prejudice in your favor.At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others...young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of the night and life."
870,Samantha S,"The Great Gatsby was phenomenal a book everyone should read. It was the best book I ever had to read for school. The setting, the format, and the wording was excellent and I loved all of the characters. The characters all played a big role in the story. I never expected Gatsby to be the man he was or became because for how he felt at his own parties. He was also a little obsessive, which I would never think he would be ether. This is such a great book and I think everyone should read it because it also has underlying meanings that are great to think about and to know in life."
871,Joe Gola,"I'm awed by the prose, with its synesthetic descriptions and surreal extended metaphors. ""The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn."" There's a weird subtlety to the storytelling as well—the details seem out-of-left-field, and yet they contribute something fitting and precise. ""No amount of fire of freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart."""
872,Donna Robbins,"I never read this in school and didn't know anything about the premise/themes when I picked this up - what a terrific surprise. The prose was top notch (expected) but I was surprised at how the story really drew me in, right from the beginning; evocative of time and place and with an amazing cast of mostly unlikeable but memorable characters. The themes of decadence and excess (and how those relate to the quest for the American Dream) are as compelling today as when the book was written 90 years ago. I can see why it's considered one of the great American novels.I listened to the Naxos audiobook with stellar narration by William Hope. "
873,Lise Petrauskas,"This is my third time reading The Great Gatsby. I enjoyed it, but I enjoyed it even more the last time (the second time) I read because it had been so long since I'd read it the first time that I had mostly forgotten what happens. Gatsby is oddly action packed, which of funny for a book about people who do almost nothing. The suspense of wondering about the outcome is partially what makes this book tick. Having just read The Beautiful and Damned, I noticed that Gatsby has more forward motion and an almost a kinetic energy, so to speak, that is managed and spilled in more controlled, explosive bursts. Fitzgerald combines details of visual, sensual, and auditory experience in ways that are gratifyingly complex and surprising. Part of the energy of the book also seems to come from the emotion inherent in Nick's voice and attitude. Nick even occasionally addresses of the reader and makes reference to the story as he's writing it, a detail I hadn't noticed before.Muller did Fitzgerald justice. His inflection and diction are excellent. I started listening last night and, aside from a few hours for sleeping, I didn't stop until I'd listened to the whole thing. "
874,Stephen,"Read this like 40 years ago. Heard a rebroadcast of Fresh Air with Maureen Corrigan, the Georgetown University Literature professor talking about the book and her new book, ""So We Read On: How the Great Gatsby Came to Be and Why It Endures."" She loves it, actually she worships it and reads it like all the time - at least once a year. I enjoyed it. Short book, engaging with great characters, Jay Gatsby, Daisy Buchanan and Nick Carraway. There were things I remembered, but not the tragic ending. I remember this quote particularly: ""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy – they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made."" "
875,Jonah,"A teacher once explained to me: “Lots of us have read Gatsby, but we should remember that there are some people out there who haven't had the advantages of reading it.” I’ve always remembered that, because it’s true. Some people out there can not recall a single memory from any of the book’s scenes: the billboard eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg, the view of Gatsby’s house across the way and his view of Daisy’s green light over the water, or even the bookcover’s multilayered images of fireworks over Coney Island at night and the nude-pupil-ed eyes of a woman with a green tear down her right cheek. Many do not recall the exact meaning of The Great Gatsby. They read it in English classes, and can place some of the scenes. Fitzgerald’s descriptions of life in New York City in 1922, the characters names: Jay Gatsby, Daisy Buchanan and Tom Buchanan, Jordan Baker, Wolfshiem, Wilson, the basic plot outline. The promise of love and it’s quick and invisible disappearance. Maybe a few more details here and there. But then what? I knew a girl who was almost a ladyShe had a way with all the men in her lifeEvery inch of her blossomed in beautyShe was born on the Fourth of JulyI used to sleep at the foot of Old GloryAnd awaken by the dawn’s early lightBut much to my surprise when I opened my eyesI was the victim of the Great Compromise		- John Prine “The Great Compromise”It is not a coincidence that the main characters in both song and book personify America in their respective settings. Later in the song, at the drive-in movie, the girl abandons the singer only to jump into another sports car. Gatsby also drove a yellow sports car. In fact, as Americans, we have always had an affinity for cars, trucks, motorcycles -- the road. Think of James Dean, Frank Bullitt, or even 2 Fast 2 Furious. So maybe there is a theme here, in both song and book and culture, that can be distilled into a common bond which is something unequivocally American. John Prine is a singer-songwriter who released four albums on Atlantic Records between 1971-75, was dropped and moved to Asylum in 1978, and then started his own record label, Oh Boy, in 1984, which he’s been running since. And while comparisons of John Prine to Bob Dylan were probably overused at the time, there is a legitimate connection. Dylan, after all, exploded the possibility of meaning in a folk or rock-and-roll song for every singer-songwriter following him by incorporating the influence of Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac. But before rock-and-roll, the closest thing was jazz, specifically be-bop, which was Kerouac’s model for his writing. And it was jazz, but more specifically The Jazz Age, a term so perfectly coined by Fitzgerald, that brought the beginnings of our modern American culture, and a world which is described so vividly in Gatsby. New York City in 1922. The boys home from an unprecedented war. Prohibition, bootleggers, speakeasies. The market up, up, up. Major scandal in baseball. Exhibitionists dancing on poles, frat boys swallowing goldfish, big booming cities. Women’s suffrage, development of insulin, Albert Einstein, James Joyce, Sigmund Freud, Marcel Proust, T.S. Eliot. But Gatsby is about none of these things. It’s just the memories of one summer, but in it is the personification of American values and ideals, then and now. Gatsby, Fitzgerald, the self-inventor, the celebrity, the privileged, the host, the liar and cheater, the idealist, and his desire, knowing or unknowing, of Daisy, Zelda, the delicate, the musical, the unattainable, the truth. But the truth is never certain. Gatsby is loaded with factual inaccuracies and contradictions in its timeline while the narrator reveals his observations in an indirect manner, as if the facts or plot are less important than the images we see. In recalling scenes from Gatsby, we aren’t sure what we remember, however, what we observe of Gatsby and Daisy is vivid and dream-like. The narrator, Nick Carraway, is the eyes of the reader. The same eyes as Doctor T.J. Eckleburg, watching over the story from a modern billboard advertisement. The reader watches as Nick watches, as Gatsby watches Daisy’s light from his window, as Nick watches Gatsby’s mansion across the way. And we watch the story unfold, like recalling a distant memory, against the current, borne into the past…"
876,Glen O'Brien,"Nothing much happens in the first half of this book but the nothing much that happens is wonderfully described by Fitzgerald. When the dramatic elements kick in it picks up pace but throughout this masterpiece Fitzgerald's unmistakable gift for language shines through. It was also great to come across a line lifted by Bob Dylan. Jay Gatsby cries ""incredulously"" to his friend (and the narrator) Nick, ""Can't repeat the past? Why of course you can!"" Dylan uses this line in his song ""Summer Days"" from the 2001 album ""Love and Theft"". ""She says, 'You can't repeat the past.' I say, 'You can't? What do you mean, you can't? Of course you can."" In ""Ballad of a Thin Man"" way back in 1965 Dylan said derisively to ""Mr. Jones"" - ""You've read through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books; You're very well read; it's well known."" Seems like Bob has done some reading of his own. The Vintage Classic edition I read has a wonderful cover illustration which perfectly captures the style of the era Fitzgerald himself dubbed ""the Jazz Age."" It will be interesting to see what Baz Luhrman makes of the novel in his next film. "
877,Jessamine Mernin,"Looking at Class and the meaning of the ""American Dream"" as a lense to read one of the greatest American novels (no offence Huck Finn, you are still my number one)! The Great Gatsby, as been read and reread, taught and retaught in high-schools and I would argue for good reasons! Though I had read it before, once in my own high-school experience, it lends itself well to second and third reads with a focus on a different element. This time I am reading for economy, class divides, property, wealth, upward mobility and essentially the golden crown of the gilded age! What is the price that Jay Gatsby must pay in order to ""buy Daisy?"" as she is arguably the one thing for sale that even his lavish wealth can not buy.The town of ""ashes"" and train tracks, the secondary role of kept mistress in-between the lands of West and East Egg, of old and new wealth splashed around the water sound. The overwhelming abundance, grotesque and ostentatious displays of liquor, food, automobiles, and pleasure are expensive in the monetary sense, though empty in true value. Like, only F. Scott Fitzgerald can do, he writes with exactitude and precision that is breathtaking! His characters, his metaphors, his language is as luxurious as the circumstances described. I can not wait to begin discussing this classic YA Novel with my students in December and start to answer some of the essential questions that Gatsby poses!"
878,Tess,"""They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. (...) It was sharply different from the West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself."" -p.19""He paused. 'I see you're looking at my cuff buttons.'I hadn't been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory.'Finest specimens of human molars,' he informed me.'Well!'

Then I turned back to Gatsby - and was startled at his expression. He looked - and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden - as if he had 'killed a man'. For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way."" -p.141""As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat's shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand."" -p.142"
879,Taylor Rotenberg,"The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald was an exciting, enticing read that was humorous and easy to comprehend. The main character, Jay Gatsby, was a rich man who threw a lot of parties and was in love with Daisy, a married woman from the suburbs. Gatsby's neighbor was friends with Daisy and helped Gatsby get her back. One day, Gatsby, Nick (the neighbor), Daisy, and Daisy's husband all went to the town and when they drove back in separate cars Daisy hit and killed Myrtle (another neighbor). Myrtle's husband thought that Gatsby had done it, so he killed him.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes romance novels that are fairly short, because this book is a romance novel and it was an easy read. Also, I would recommend this book to people who are interested in the 1920s, because that's when the story took place."
880,Andre Piucci,"“Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive, and not after he is dead.” "
881,Adie,"Fitzgerald successfully captures a lost era in American history, the 1920s. He bottles up a time when chivalry is slowly being lost, and the America we know today is being found. As an honest man, named Mr. Caraway, watches Gatsby, Daisy, Tom and other adulterous parties from various social classes, he sees the evil bite of love, that can kill great men like Gatsby and poor men like Wilson. Fitzgerald shows that corruption in love affects all parties. Gatsby and Wilson are overly faithful, and that is why they are both destroyed by love. Tom and Daisy are so immoral and adulterous that they survive it. Mr. Caraway the honest man is so turned off by what he sees that he can't love.  Fitzgerald uses the deceit in Fitzgerald's tragedy isn't all that embodies this time in American history. His language, flowery detail, and the grand parties also grasp the essence of the twenties. Fitzgerald's novel is appealing to us today because we can see a different culture that we evolved from. This novel is comparable top reserved architecture.Lastly Fitzgerald created a tragedy that is Shakespeare-esque which all scholars can appreciate."
882,Gabriela Bauchwitz,"Story about the ""Roaring Twenties"" which follows a cautionary tale of the extent that people are willing to go to achieve the ideal ""American Dream"".Ever since I started learning about U.S. History the ""Roaring Twenties"" era really fascinated and intrigued me. I always thought to myself that if I could go back in time to a particular era in history I would choose to go to the 1920s in the U.S. Their fashion, their way of life, their customs, everything just seemed so effortless and glamorous. When I read ""The Great Gatsby"" it was just the cherry on top of my obsession with the twenties. His way of life and to the extent he was willing to go to have in his possession something that would never be his again was so catastrophically beautiful. It was the type I book that I knew would have a tragic ending, but I still enjoyed every bit of it until the end. "
883,Sara Abbasi,One of the best books I've read this year. 
884,Nikki,"It was really interesting to re-read this book, because I hadn't read it since it was required reading in high school. This book was the book that made me fall in love with the 1920s, and to this day it remains one of my favorite eras. My dad told me, this is one of those books that you will gather new meaning from every time you read it at different stages in life. I think he was right. I won't bore you with what meaning I gathered from it, but it was funny how my perceptions of the characters when I read this book in high school were completely off. I always had envisioned Gatsby as this super cool guy who was so knowledgable and really had his act together. Ha! I completely misinterpreted his character. I guess when I was sixteen I just had this preconceived notion of adults that, if you're really wealthy and have nice clothes and a nice house and host really cool parties, well, clearly you have your act together. Oh, naive little Nikki. We all know this is not so. I still like Gatsby, but for different reasons now. He's a peculiar character. Poor guy. That was my opinion of him throughout. I pitied him. But I was still rooting for him. I wanted him to be happy. It is clear to my why this story has stood the test of time. The story is so human (if that makes sense) that every generation will be able to connect to it and somehow be able to relate to the characters and their lamentations. I am pleased to say that I liked this book the second time around just as much, if not more so than the first time around. I suspect this is because I understand it better at this point in my life. "
885,teleri,"We should ask ourselves one question and only one question in our time we spend alive, and that is, why is The Great Gatsby so good? I got to page 12, when the book starts on page 7, and I already didn't want to put it down - something I'm glad of.My sister bought the movie in 2014 and once I had watched it, I soon found out it was a book, and for over a year I have been waiting to read it, and I'm so glad that I have. I am finally able to say I've read it and that I loved it.Whilst reading this book, something stirred in my stomach. With each turn of the page I felt something I have hardly felt, this book that I was able to read in the late night and the early hours of one sitting, was fast becoming one of my favourites. I love this book, there is no faults. It's a beautiful story, and I'm glad F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote it."
886,Fły,I loved it!!it's better than the movie
887,Neil Procter,"So we drove on towards death through the cooling twilght... A love story, a mystery, a thriller, played out under the watchful eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg, a metaphor if ever there was one. Tinged with melancholy and a jaded outlook, just the way I like it. Culiminates with one of the finest closing paragraphs in fiction."
888,Jessica Hansen,"Do you know how everybody always says 'The Great Gatsby' is Fitzgeralds Masterpiece? And you know what: it is the most sincere thing to say about this book. This book is beyond beautiful written and told.I was never forced to read this classic story in school or university because it is not as popular in Germany but I'm not sad about it. I think it makes a big difference to read a book on your own and to live and experience the insanely tragic love story of Gatsby and Daisy by yourself. I feel at a loss for words. This story had something so sad and utterly beautiful to itself that I don't know how to put my feelings into words. I felt so connected to Gatsby and Nick and I loved both of the characters so much.I'm left with a feeling of tragedy because I feel Gatsby did not deserve  any of it. He was hopelessly devoted to Daisy since the day he met her but he never felt good enough for her. And in the moment he finally got everything he needs to take care for Daisy (because she is a freaking rich brat and I hate her guts) he realizes Daisy is no longer (or never was) the woman he fell in love with. I think it is a treacherous thing that he believed her to be something more; something special. I'm in love with a lot of quotes from this book but first of all I think this one captures the essence of the plot so good:

""Her voice is full of money.""

I love how the story shows that the rich people are irresponsible and that their wealth allows them to get away with murder. Literally. The ending when nobody shows up to Gatsbys funeral is the most heart-breaking occurrence in the whole book but absolutely realistic. They all didn't want to be involved with his death nor show him the respect of a fare-well. They enjoyed his parties and took everything he gave them but they would not even return the favour in his last hour.""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy - they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness."" I love that the story is told through Nick's perspective and I enjoyed every single word of it. It was indeed a real page-turner. “They’re a rotten crowd’, I shouted across the lawn. ‘You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together.” I never felt so inspired after a story. It is definitely one of my new absolute favourites."
889,Gisela Claveria,"Read this back in H.S., needless to say with my horrible memory I didn’t remember a thing. It’s definitely a novel worth reading over again though, especially as you get older and gain a different perspective on life in general. I can really appreciate this novel as a historical literary piece, and the insight it provides on life in the 1920s in particular the glimpse it provides into the world of the newly rich and the old rich at that time. You do get a sense that at this time in America so much is possible. I remember though that even in H.S. I couldn’t relate to these characters and the pretentious, materialistic values they seem to espouse. They all seem to be so artificial, even our objective narrator, and no one seems to truly care for one another…. (except for the poor car mechanic who really does seem to be devoted to his wife – she got what was coming). The main theme of the novel as we all know is about achieving the American dream. But what exactly is the American dream circa 1920s? Is it to make lots of money in order to forget one’s past and roots and pretend to be something that you clearly aren’t in order to acquire the love and acceptance of superficial people that will never accept you anyway? Isn’t that what Gatsby ultimately does? Clearly he had built up an image of Daisy that was as unreal as her love for him. Although this is a simple and quick read, the characters are anything but simple and the symbolism and metaphors makes for a complex read. This is a great book club read. What makes this a true classic I think is not so much it’s importance in American literature but the fact that 80 years later the book is still very relevant in today’s American society where materialism seems to be the center of the great American dream, where having more and bigger things (homes, cares, clothes, etc) seems to add superficial worth to people even if their lives are as empty of true love and friendship as Gatsby’s was. And also where some dreams themselves have gotten bigger and harder attain. "
890,W.,"This is probably one of my top five favorite works of fiction of all time. One year I decided to write a paper on F. Scott and I detailed in what ways his personal life paralleled those of his characters, but most especially Gatsby. I guess I have a sort of tenderness for Gatsby, even though he seemed to be a boat against the wind, and seemed to seek a less than substantive life at times. He did seek true love, his Daisy. And Daisy, who is completely selfish, was a smart cookie, who unfortunately made a bad choice in marriage and sealed her own fate with a rather loveless marriage, forever unavailable to pining Gatsby. Her description of the fate of womankind to be nothing more than ""beautiful little fool[s:]"" is the best she can muster regarding in actuality her own life's purpose, and this has always been one of my favorite quotes of the book. Fitzgerald has an incredible mastery of language and metaphor that is so descriptive, without being flowery or overly sentimental. I'm drawn to this book again and always seem to find another hidden meaning with each read."
891,Jill Zhang,"The Great Gatsby, written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a book that represents a series of complicated emotional involvements during the Jazz Age—1920s. It mainly describes how Gatsby, a penniless man uses unseemly ways to become a great millionaire, and then, loses his love. The book reveals the negative side of the period’s gaiety and freedom, portraying wealthy and attractive people surrounded by gilded numbness and selfishness. Amid all the themes, the falling of the American dream is the most significant. The author Fitzgerald experienced the roaring era, so he knew how the American dream at that time was erected on a stage built by sand. He wanted to save the lost generation of that era and warn the new generation of the future. The Great Gatsby, an eternal song from the Jazz Age, is not a harmonious melody but a somber anthem. "
892,Olivia Rivers,"Olivia RiversEnglish 3rdMay 14, 2008The Great GatsbyF. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel The Great Gatsby was an extraordinary book. This novel set in the 1920s is a piece of literature that captured the essence of the roaring twenties. The book was filled with such new and controversial events influenced from that time frame which added to the character of the novel. Filled with disreputable affairs and unforeseen endings this novel created elevated intrigue. This book contained believable emotions, actions, and themes.	This novel is one that should interest many. The whole plot is one that can be appreciated. It is easy enough to follow. It begins with Nick Carraway, the narrator of the story moving to the West Egg District in New York. He meets his new wealthy neighbor who is named Jay Gatsby. Gatsby, Nick learns is in love with his cousin Daisy who is married to Tom Buchannan. To complicate matters even more Tom is having an affair with Myrtle Wilson. The story revolves around the different affairs committed by the people Nick knows. Nick of course can say nothing and must go along with the different plans that his cousin and friends plan. The whole story has several different surprises that keep the book full of deception and excitement. 	I thought the whole plot was well thought out and developed. I found no fault at all with the direction the novel took. I would recommend this book to anyone. This book has so much drama to attract people to its creative grasps. With the mystery of what will happen, and the curiosity concerning the secret affairs I would say this book is very much exiting. The novel contains small stories within the larger one that helps to add to the understanding and insight into the novel. I felt this book created a true sense of how the roaring twenties affected those experiencing the new age. With this book set in the beginning of the decade there were still concerns over the many distasteful actions of many of the flappers and new age men. Daisy was a woman who longed for excitement and change. She welcomed the new decade of free expression. Through dress and actions she easily expressed that the change was approved by her. I felt that the way that Daisy, Gatsby, and Myrtle addressed the time they were living in felt authentic. Every concept and area of the novel felt real. I could believe that this novel could have been based on a true story.	The style of the writing and how the novel was written added to the creativity of the novel. With the novel being narrated by Nick Carraway who is essentially the main character the characters in the novel are easy to relate to and comprehend. I think that with the way that Nick shares his opinion as narrator characters can be developed and analyzed more effortlessly. When Nick expresses his opinions concerning the different affairs taking place or the different tasks he is asked to perform, such as having Daisy over so Gatsby can be with her, it creates the accumulation of the needed information to start judging the characters. 	The characters were above all, in my opinion the most interesting subjects in the novel. Each was developed with a different personality and plan that complimented the other characters superbly. Each role written for that particular character felt to have been well thought out and studied. All the characters had a past and believable present. Fitzgerald organized the book to where everything flowed together effortlessly. I particularly liked the story because as I read I felt close to the characters, especially the character of Nick Carraway because his character spent so much time telling his beliefs. By the end of the book I felt like I knew how the characters felt and why the novel ended the way it did. I was not at all disappointed at all by how the novel ended, but was quite pleased by how it did end. Fitzgerald did a remarkable job writing the novel. His creative mind created a book that was filled with mystery, drama, and significance.I thought The Great Gatsby was an incredible book and believed it to be worth reading. "

894,Denise,My 2nd favorite book of all time.
895,Mark McFaddyn,"This great novel serves well as an introduction to 20th century American literature. It is short, an easy read, and, of course, the 2013 film has made it popular once more. While I thought the film was very well done, I think it would be best to read the book before seeing it, rather than the other way around.The setting is 1920's America, where gin and jazz were the rage. I think that Fitzgerald's decision to write the story from the point of view of Nick Carraway, the neighbor of Jay Gatsby, was brilliant. It allows the reader to approach Gatsby with a sense of awe, questions, and mystery—just as Carraway did. The novel addresses themes of social brutality, the clash of ideals and reality, change and the resistance of change, as well as personal issues of love, betrayal, and loyalty. In one way it is a classic Greek tragedy. Fitzgerald intended the work to be his magnum opus; to cement himself as a great writer. Published in 1925, it did not sell well, and Fitzgerald died thinking he had been a failure. The novel experience a surge of interested around WWII, and became standard reading in most high school literature classes.More here: http://www.sulisinc.com/sulisblog/201..."
896,Richie,"The Great Gatsby is a perfect example of the literary cannon. It melds lyrical writing with distinct themes and motifs that thread the characters with the ""spirit of an age"", such at the many allusions to song (especially the crooning quality of Daisy's voice) and Gatsby's Objet petite a (Daisy, or the green light at the end of the dock). It is a short but sad read; none of the characters are truly happy and spend most of the time being petty (Daisy and Tom) or living in the past (Gatsby). Nick, too, by the end is ready to leave the past behind, seeing the other characters for their superficiality. Fitzgerald keenly observes the mechanics of social communication and milieu, painting a beautiful and grotesque image of the upper class. The strong homosexual undertones allows Nick sail through his summer without being too intertwined with any one person (only a bit with Jordan) and show his love/hate with Gatsby. Each character is created in a naturalistic way; no one is glamorized to the point where their flaws don't even them out and make them human. The Great Gatsby created a future only to live out the past, making him a dead man long before his unfortunate ending."
897,Laurel Hicks,"A fascinating character study of the land of Oz. I don't know whether Fitzgerald had Baum's Wizard in mind when he wrote the book, but I certainly did when I read it."
898,Ryan Healy,"One of the best – if not the best – American novels to date, this is undoubtedly one of my favorite books. Telling the tale of how a group of characters are directly affected by the mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby, this quick read provides fantastic commentary on the assent to wealth and status and the consequences that come with it. As an aspiring writer, I find that I’m often looking at the way Fitzgerald tells his story. The narrator, Nick Carraway, is a major character in the novel but the real story is about Gatsby. The way that the portrait of this incredible man is painted by Nick is unique and exciting. Lately, I’ve been trying to think of ways to use a similar technique in my own writing, trying to tell a story about people without having it told by one of those people involved. It sounds complicated, yes, but Fitzgerald pulls it off effortlessly and allows the reader to enjoy questioning whether they can trust Nick and what it is that Nick isn’t telling them. I highly suggest that everyone picks this novel up – even if they have already read it, seeing as I just recently finished my second reading of it and find myself even more enraptured by it than ever before."
899,Hilary Nekvinda,"Nick Carroway moves from the Midwest to New York, where he lives next door to a mysterious man named Jay Gatsby - who loves to throw extravagant parties. Jay is in love with Daisy, who is married to Tom. Tom is having an affair with Mrytle Wilson. As truths are discovered, all the character's lives are turned upside down. Excerpt:In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.“Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me,just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.” He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores."
900,Cady Junker,"Have you ever wanted something that you can't have? ""The Great Gatsby"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald, tells a story about this that's a true wonder. This classic and romantic book tells a deep story to all those that will listen. The book is told from the point of view of Nick. Nick is neighbors with Gatsby, a man who is constantly throwing extravagant parties, and lives in a huge house. When Nick finds out the real reason of Gatsby's parties, and big house, it adds to the magnificence of the tale. Gatsby has romantic past with Nick's cousin Daisy, who lives just across from Gatsby. But, unfortunately for Gatsby, Daisy has gotten married since their last encounter. Daisy's not happy though with her husband, Tom, but at the same time she's not willing to leave him.""Fitzgerald's writing is unassailably magnificent"", says Common Sense Media. This amazing piece of literature is highschool level reading, because of difficult words that require the skill of comprehending. Even so, I think this book is really well written and everyone should read it at some point in their lifetime. Will Gatsby's enchanting attempts to win over Daisy again work? Will there be a happily ever after ending? To find out you'll have to read the book!"
901,Katya Bogdanov,"I read The Great Gatsby pre-emptively, a good while before the movie came out. It was a spontaneous purchase driven by the glamour of the movie trailer and the beauty of the edition I came across. I’d never even heard about it before. Serendipity at work, because…From the very first paragraph it became one of the two books I had so far categorized on Goodreads as “absolute-all-time-favourites” (together with The Road, by Cormac McCarthy). A few reasons. First, it is one of the few books I’ve encountered where every sentence seeps with beauty. Not necessarily profound meaning, or thought-provoking ideas, but sheer beauty. The words just come together like pearls on a string to deliver a final product with an aesthetic value that far exceeds the sum of its parts. The other thing I marvel at is the elegant simplicity with which The Great Gatsby expresses a complex idea. I’ve found that too many authors give their characters long rambling monologues or otherwise engage in extensive narration to get their point across. Not Fitzgerald - the novel is his idea. The Great Gatsby is a story, nothing more, but its actors live the dangers and delusions of the then newly-minted American dream, without soliloquies. The novel gave me the rare feeling you get from a work of art where you just know that it needs no edits. There’s nothing to add or to take away. You just understand. You understand the tragedy of living in an envisioned world of grandeur, of reaching higher and higher, obsessing about fitting every part of your life into a grand personal narrative of wealth, success and high society and then disappearing without a trace (even to the reader, it’s not immediately clear that he died), while the world carelessly moves on. At the same time, like Nick, you can’t help but appreciate the extraordinary power of Gatsby’s dreams. Like his parties, Gatsby’s dreams set him apart from the mundane dreariness of life Fitzgerald recreated in the first third or so of the book (think of the scene when Nick first visits the Buchanans). This power, while awe-inspiring, is also more than a little frightening - it is what drives Gatsby to obsess, among other things, over Daisy, and to insist that she follow his script. He did not love Daisy, you see (even though he himself thought he did) - he needed her to be his trophy, his crowning achievement. Marriage to such a desirable higher class woman would be a testament to Gatsby’s success - definitive proof that if you believe and work hard enough, you can pull yourself up from the dirt. That’s the attractiveness of the book, I think. The power of Fitzgerald’s idea, the elegance of its expression, and the tragedy of the grand delusion of the novel’s protagonist, a delusion that is all the more tragic because each one of us is thus deluded, at least briefly, at least to a small extent. I can understand why The Great Gatsby can be a relatively less enchanting read for those who look to sympathize with characters in their reading; I really can. The characters, as people, are all rather unlikeable. But I don’t think that’s the point. The Great Gatsby is not a story of good and bad, or a story about romance, or a story that’s supposed to keep you guessing; it’s a story of what is and what was. It’s a study of a time period that was defining to the American ideology. It’s a perceptive portrait, painted in broad, exaggerated, yet elegant strokes, of the generations of American dreamers that made the country great and (likely) also cemented its faults.The Great Gatsby is the work of a master, no less."
902,Grant,"A perfect novel and one of the five best books ever written. This is the book I like within reach of my desk, the book I would bring with me to another planet, the book I have to open now and then just to read the first or last paragraph of. I love so many of Fitzgerald's stories--nearly all in fact--and while there is something to take from any of his novels I think this his one flawless masterpiece in that form."
903,Samantha ,"After reading The Great Gatsby for the second time, it is now my favorite book of all time. It is just so beautiful. It's short and sweet. Every line is beautifully crafted and Fitzgerald's prose is rich with description and human insight. I also picked up on a lot of things I missed the first time around, which was a fun surprise. Gatsby is narrated by Nick, a supporting character in the drama that unfolds on Long Island in the summer of 1922. He recounts the story of Jay Gatsby, a mysterious millionaire who arrived that summer to win back his now-married love, Daisy Buchanan. What unfolds is dramatic, romantic, and ultimately tragic. I think this book has a truly perfect climax and denouement. Fitzgerald's attention to detail is superb and I marvel at how every word he uses is perfectly chosen. In my opinion, this is the great American novel. If you haven't read it yet you should. And check out Baz Luhrmann's fabulous film adaptation starring Leonardo DiCaprio. In my opinion, this film version perfectly captures the essence of the novel and its use of dialogue straight from the book is great. "
904,Alyssa Rose,Such an amazing book. Loved it a lot. An easy read with many deep messages in the words. Can't wait to study this more - for school!!
905,Patricia,"My idea of rebelling as a teenager was refusing to read the books I was told to read in school. I didn't like being told how to interpret what I was reading and most literature in educational curriculum are boring as hell.Aside from not getting a better grade in 11th grade English, I'm glad I read this book as an adult and only skimmed through back when it was only a reading assignment. I'm not surprised that the book didn't get much recognition when it was first published and gained popularity years later during the Beat Generation. If Jack Kerouac had had a little stability in his life, he probably would have written something similar to this. Fitzgerald's writing style is a little choppy, but the love story and the characters in this book are timeless. Even though this book is almost a century old, it embodies the unattainable quest for love and the disparity of social class which unfortunately is still very prevalent today. "
906,Greg Williams,"Fabulous read, old sport! I had trouble putting this one down and so I read it over the course of a day. This is a story about people imprisoned by wealth and one man (Gatsby) who was using his wealth to try to recover something from his past. And it all goes sideways in a tragic way. There are no ""good guys"" in this novel; all the characters are despicable in their own way (even the narrator, Nick). In the end, I felt sorry for all of them.IMHO very well written. I can see why many think this is Fitzgerald's masterpiece. I would highly recommend that you give this one a read!"
907,Scatterbooker,"A beautifully written snapshot of New York in the 1920s, old sport. The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be F. Scott Fitgerald’s magnum opus, as well as a literary classic. I’m sure many people have studied this novel at some point during their school days!It is narrated from the perspective of Nick Carraway who comes from a well-off Midwest family to New York in 1922. He becomes a mediator in the messy romance between his mysterious and fabulously wealthy next-door neighbour, Jay Gatsby, and his married cousin, Daisy. Daisy’s husband, Tom, is also having an affair and Nick spends most of the novel dating Jordan Baker, who is a flapper and golf pro.The Great Gatsby has become the quintessential novel of the 1920s, or the Jazz Age as Fitzgerald preferred to call it, and the decay of the American Dream. Jay Gatsby spent his entire adult life chasing the notion of the great American dream only to end up dead and alone, which implies that Fitzgerald believed it was a futile endeavour.I believe the characters of Jay Gatsby and Nick Carraway represent different aspects of how Fitzgerald viewed himself. Fitzgerald’s wife was similar to the character of Daisy and it is well-documented that he spent a great deal of effort to make a name and fortune to impress her, much the way that Gatsby does for Daisy. Nick is the part of Fitzgerald who sees through the snobbish veneer of New York’s elite, forever feeling like an outsider.The Great Gatsby is another one of my all-time favourite novels. I love Fitzgerald’s beautiful writing style that encapsulates the 1920s perfectly. It was a tumultuous period and this novel provides a perfect snapshot of several of the major social issues of the time: bootlegging, consumerism, social climbing, snobbery, fast cars, and reckless behaviour. The original cover is possibly my favourite book cover ever!I can't think of a David Bowie song that fits with The Great Gatsby, but I'm open to suggestions. As an outsider who made New York his home, I can see why Bowie listed this book as one of his favourites. I think he led the Gatsby lifestyle for quite some time before he realised the silliness of it all.This book is part of the David Bowie Reading Challenge #DBowieBooksOriginally posted at https://scatterbooker.wordpress.com/2..."
908,Maegan,"This is an outstanding book! Fitzgerald told an unbelievably realistic tale. Everything rings with truth. I think part of it has to do with the fact that a lot of what was put into the book was pulled from real life. Daisy's comment on having a beautiful fool of a daughter was something Zelda said about her own daughter. And the way Fitzgerald portrays Gatsby, it's like he's talking about himself. (view spoiler)[Fitzgerald skims over Gatsby's death like it's some how...sacred. The death of Gatsby is almost as if he's foretelling his own death and doesn't want to linger on it, contrary to how he wrote Myrtle's death. (hide spoiler)] At times it felt like Fitzgerald was seeing the future. Tom would have been the perfect Nazi. And then you have the parties. The parties, in the beginning, are wild and gay, but the last parties are different. Events happen that cause the parties to spoil, and then they stop all together. World War One...Fitzgerald saw the future, I swear. Everything came together soooo well, and I appreciate the book so much more because I know that Fitzgerald was OCD about his work.I hate to pick favorites but that last line was AMAZING! Scary and haunting, yet still so beautiful. No wonder it was put on Fitzgerald's tombstone.I am literally out of words to describe how amazing every detail of this novel was. Just read it. Don't procrastinate it. Just read it."
909,Tushar Chakrabaorti,"In my short duration as an ardent reader of books, i have never been more enthralled by a book, more captivated by the characters, and more enchanted by the prose, as this.....This may have been the single greatest piece of fiction I've read."

911,Mikhail,"'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'This isn't just an epigram — life is much more successfully looked at from a single window after all.... a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of anti-climax.'Now, don't think my opinion on these matters is final,' he seemed to say, 'just because I'm stronger and more of a man than you are.'I've heard it said that Daisy's murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.'All right,' I said,'I'm glad it's girl. And I hope she'll be fool — that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.'... each one introduced to us as Mr Mumble.It was one of the rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life.'And i like large parties. They're so intimate. At small parties there isn't any privacy.'I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye.... most affections conceal something eventually, even though they don't in the beginning...Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply — I was casually sorry, and then I forgot.'You're a rotten driver,' I protested. 'Either you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn't to drive at all.''I am careful.''No, you're not.''Well, other people are,' she said lightly.'What's that got to do with it?''They'll keep out of my way,' she insisted. 'It takes two to make an accident.''Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.''I hope I never will,' she answered. 'I hate careless people. That's why I like you.'Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: 'There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and the tired.''One thing's sure and nothing's surerThe rich get richer and poor get — children.In the meantime,In between time —'It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.'Don't be morbid,' Jordan said.

She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby — nothing. He felt marrying to her, that was all.What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?And all the time something within her was crying for a decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately — and the decision must be made by some force — of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality — that was close at hand.What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldn'tbe measured?if that was true he must be have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream.There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant thing perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away. <...> When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man.'nevertheless you did throw me over,' said Jordan suddenly. 'You threw me over on the telephone. I don't give a damn about you now, but it was a new experience for me, and i felt a little dizzy for a while.'We shook hands.'Oh, and do you remember' — she added — 'a conversation we had once about driving a car?''Why — not exactly.''You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didn't i? I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.''I'm thirty,' I said. 'I'm five years too old to lie to lie to myself and call it honour.' She didn't answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.I couldn't forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy — they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made...Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter — tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further... And one fine morning —So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."
912,KL (Cat),Reread for English class. As beautiful as the first time I've read it.
913,Jim Dooley,"For me, GATSBY is not only Fitzgerald's masterpiece. It is also American literature's masterpiece. Yes, this is my favorite book. GATSBY is retrieved from the shelf about every two-to-three years, and I continue to marvel at its rich depth of expression. The story of a man who changes his life to literally become his Dream of his best possible self is fascinating.I first read GATSBY in college and, oddly enough, it was too soon. I firmly believe that I needed to have more years under my belt to appreciate the many layers of the story. However, I was impressed enough to return to it again and again, and it has rewarded me every time.GATSBY is one of those happy times when exactly the right writer told exactly the right story. Although I admire many of Fitzgerald's other works, only TENDER IS THE NIGHT comes close to approaching GATSBY. Someone once told me that the story is a tragedy, but it has not been so for me. It is a reminder that Reality does not appreciate the Dreamer...and, to achieve real happiness, the Dreamer must be willing to bear isolation."
914,Michael Scheinert,"One of the most intriguing novels I've read. Fitzgerald is masterful in his ability to convey a message to the reader through symbols, diction, and dialogue through the eyes of a third party. Most of my takeaways from the novel involve the significance of symbols. The green light certainly represents Gatsby's longing to rekindle his love with Daisy, which leaves me to wonder what my green light is. My active lens for the novel was light, and much of that is brought out through the description of eyes. The eyes of Doctor TJ Eckleburg most likely represent God's continual watch over His people, as suggested by George Wilson. My final takeway is an unanswered question: if the past is behind us, why do so many people work tirelessly towards future prospering?"
915,Lilian,"I admit, I was made to read this book for English in college, and I read it in one sitting. I think it might be the first assigned classic literature novel that I made me to read beyond the assigned pages (ok, maybe Of Mice and Men had the same effect too.)I particularly adore the Nick Carraway. Even if he is a rather passive character who seems to get dragged everywhere by Tom, Jordan, and Gatsby. He comes off as someone trustworthy and humble. I admit I get frustrated with his passiveness at times; somestimes I just want him to slap the characters, but I guess that would be acting out of character. For a guy that only knew Gatsby for three months yet held a funeral for him, and is aware that he was used as a pawn to get close to Daisy, Nick is admirable. There couldn't have been a more perfect narrator.Gatsby is beyond redeeming. He is a friendly, likable character, but it is apparent that he is a desperate mess behind his overwhelming wealth. He is clearly deluded by the idea of having Daisy and social status, even when Daisy is clearly a mess herself. I'm not sure what he even sees in her, but I suppose his undying love makes him likable, albeit frustrating.I'm not sure how Daisy can murder someone and not be terrified. I imagined her as a girly girl who gets scared easily, but to kill someone and not feel immense guilt...I have my reservations."
916,Showey Yazdanian,"The Great Gatsby is a nearly perfect novel, scarcely a word out of place. Fitzgerald is an artist – a daub here, a brushstroke there and he creates portraits of dazzling beauty.On Daisy:“Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it.”“I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.”On Myrtle:“Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips, and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice: ‘Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down.'”On Tom:“He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body–he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage–a cruel body.His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked–and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.”On the lot of them:“They were careless people, Tom and Daisy — they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made…”The book is about the enduring passion of Jay Gatsby for Daisy Buchanan, the Southern belle he’d loved and lost five years before. Daisy is now the monied, bored and careless wife of another man, but Gatsby’s love is undiminished. Indeed, his passion has far exceeded the limits of what Daisy can offer him – he will not settle for a flirtation or an affair or even a divorce – he wants nothing less than to resurrect the past. He loved Daisy, but he loved the idea of Daisy even more.I’ve only read one other work by Fitzgerald. This Side of Paradise is a bore."
917,Jessup,"I just reread this book, haven't read it since high school. I read it in one sitting - it took me four hours and that was with rereading lots of paragraphs as I went - I just could not put it down!! The writing is so beautiful. The story itself is beautiful and heartbreakingly sad. There was a depth and richness to Fitzgerald's writing that I missed when I read it the first time. Life experience of my own has given the novel a different shade...I haven't gotten that completely sucked into a book like that in a long, long time. I can't even express how much I loved reading it, except to say that even now I have a powerful urge to read it again! Maybe it's especially powerful because the storyline, and the general theme of the moral degradation of society, really resonates in today's world. Ok, so now that I'm done gushing about how amazing the book was, I have some big questions and thoughts about the story. If anyone cares to read on and join this conversation, I'd love to hear your thoughts! **********SPOILERS AHEAD ************ Was Nick a reliable narrator? I think he was, and then there's that moment after Tom's party when he ends up in bed with that male neighbor...??? What's that about? Was he in love with Gatsby? Or was it, as a friend of mine suggested, more of a ""bromance""? I like that theory better - I think Nick grew to admire certain aspects of Gatsby greatly. And he certainly pitied him. Nick was also critical of Gatsby, too - it definitely wasn't hero-worship. For all Gatsby's lies, there was a purity about Gatsby, a truthfulness and a goodness about him that made him infinitely more likeable than Daisy and her ilk, and Nick recognized it. Nick himself had a lot more class than all of the other characters. But then that was the point, right? The juxtaposition of morality and vacuous immorality? The thing is, although Nick is a saint compared to Daisy's crowd, he is far from perfect. More like an average guy with average morals and discernment. Another big question I had was: Did Daisy ever love Gatsby?? I do not question Gatsby's love for Daisy at all - even if the dream of loving her eventually overrode everything, and grew so out of control that it could never actually be fulfilled in reality. Still, he loved her, unquestionably. But did she ever love him at all? It's easy to assume that maybe she loved him in her younger days. However, I have a hard time even buying that. Daisy was probably so immature back then, and used to men falling all over her. She didn't even wait a few years for him to return from war? And actually wasn't he already at Oxford when she married Tom? If she loved him, she wouldn't have married Tom. Period. Her love of money and the lifestyle it affords trumped her love of anything, in my opinion. She actually has much more in common with Tom than Jay Gatsby...which makes it believable that her bond with Tom was stronger than her feelings for Gatsby. I think Gatsby came along at a time in her life when she was feeling ignored and maybe slightly older...she's had a child, her husband is openly cheating on her, and much of the thrill has gone out of her life. The fling with Gatsby, the incredibly rich guy from her past who worships the ground she walks on, was just the confidence-booster Daisy needed. Who cares if it destroys lives in the process? Admittedly, I am being very hard on Daisy, but as the second half of the novel progressed I became less and less sympathetic toward her. Another question: What was wrong with Gatsby??? One of the things that makes this novel so magical (and also frustrating at times) is all the stuff that is left unsaid, or left out. For example, although we get a rough sketch of Gatsby's past, many questions are left unanswered. During the scene where Gatsby and Daisy are reunited for the first time, Nick goes outside and stands under a tree, taking our view of the scene away with him. What did they say to each other?? What were the details of their relationship??? I think Fitzgerald did this deliberately, because he knew that our imaginations could fill in the gaps, and that shrouding the details makes it somehow more romantic. I think he was trying to say that the details don't matter -- what really matters is what the relationship did to transform (and ultimately, destroy) Gatsby's life. Gatsby had such a need to be loved and a need for approval...it was so sad. Yet that need for approval seemed to be focused primarily on Daisy - he didn't appear to care about what his family thought, let alone the many friends and strangers who frequented his parties. Indeed, it seemed like Gatsby's laser-beam focus on Daisy actually prevented him from forming any other meaningful relationships in his life, evidenced by the very poor turnout at his funeral. Yet he had everything in the world to be proud of! He worked his way up from the lower rungs of society into a self-made millionaire. So what if he was involved with bootlegging and some shady dealings with Wolfsheim...that's still a lot closer to ""honest work"" than Tom or Daisy had ever come! So why didn't Gatsby just believe in himself, feel good about the person he was, and find a girl who loved him? (I realize that this was all part of the very tragic love story element of the novel, and I wouldn't change a thing about the story, I'm just musing here.) And finally: Do you think that the hit and run that killed Myrtle made any lasting impression on Daisy? What about Gatsby's murder? Did she feel anything when she heard about it? Does she feel guilty? Or does she just let all of those feelings and all of those memories slip into the ether, and order another mint julep?"
918,Esme Bowen," The great gatsby is a book about love, triumph, death, and how some people are not really who they seem to be. Daisy acted like she was someone adventurous but really it was all an act. She could have left Tom the man she never really loved and run away with Gatsby the person she really did love. Daisy really only cared about riches and a comfortable life not being with the person she loved. She only stayed with Tom because she was comfortable. They were rich, and there was never much drama. I think if Daisy truly loved Gatsby she would give it all up to be with him. Even though Gatsby was rich and could give her a lot there would be drama and questioning if she ran away with him. Daisy's ""adventurous side"" was all an act if she was truly like that she would run away with Gatsby without hesitation. What puzzled me was that if Tom already cheated on Daisy with a girl who is also married why would he be so bothered if she cheated on him? Daisy should waited for Gatsby because if she did he wouldn't have died and she wouldn't be married to Tom. Over all I think that the author couldn't have given the book a better ending. I don't want I cookie cutter perfect love story ending a tragic one with twists and turns is much better then any other. "
919,kat,"6 January 2015:""He won't touch her,"" I said. ""He's not thinking about her.""31 January 2013:Daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.*****30 June 2012:It occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well.Truth.*****9 January 2011:Oh bliss, bliss, bliss, and bliss again. What a perfect tonic to a shitty ass motherfucking day.*****Since I imagine a review for this will come up at least annually in this here Goodreads profile, what I thought I'd do is quote a favorite passage from that particular reading. And today, that is this:""I mean, it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.""""I'm thirty,"" I said. ""I'm five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor.""She didn't answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away."
920,Julie Ehlers,"Now that I've pulled myself together I can say a few words about Gatsby, like that it's beautiful, and timeless, and feels contemporary--it could have been written last year. It's like a razor, shiny and sharp, cutting away everything inessential and probably cutting you too if you get too close, which you probably will.I think I was in college the first time I read this, although I didn't read it for college--I borrowed a copy from a friend, who'd gotten it from her cousin, who had read it for her eighth-grade English class (the notes in the margin, you can imagine, didn't exactly enhance the experience). But this points up the fact that Gatsby is one of those books that's usually assigned to people who are too young to appreciate it. Even at twenty, I was clearly too young. Better to read it after you've spent some time beating against the current yourself. I'm very glad I gave this another chance. "
921,Samyogita,"I liked it but failed to see the kind of absolute perfection that everyone (that means you, Stephen Fry) raves about. Maybe that's just me and I need to come back to it after some time to really appreciate it; god knows it won't be the first time.BUT it's one of the only 3 (I think) 'american' novels that I've actually managed to finish and like.Recent edit [20 Dec 2012]: I happened! Definitely one of those books that become increasingly beautiful in retrospect. So I'd like to take my first impression back, please. Going back for a second read soon!John Green certainly helped! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9Au9... (Don't watch if you haven't read it; don't miss if you have!)"
922,Carolyn,"A wonderful book to reread. The characters are well-developed and Gatsby is particularly appealing. Tom Buchanan is a brute, and Daisy is sad and shallow. But the story pulls you in and it is hard to put down even when you already know how it will end. A real pleasure. Now on to Tender is the Night."
923,Laken Scott,I tried to read this at the beginning of last year for a (failed) book club with my friends. I thought it was going to be boring and hard to read since it was written in the 20s and is considered a classic. Boy was I wrong! I read it through in a night and then went back to the beginning and annotated it. This book is well crafted and has plenty of foreshadowing and biblical allusions I didn't catch in the first read. The plot is beautiful and the whole theme of the American Dream is perfectly captured. This is the kind of book I'll keep on my bookshelves and read again and again! 
924,David Ciferri,"F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby is hugely popular and a literary classic. It deserves both distinctions.Who was The Great Gatsby? The short answer is James Gatz, who came from a poor farming family but left North Dakota at seventeen with a driving instinct for glory. In reinventing himself as Jay Gatsby he took on the persona he needed to pursue this glory.As a lieutenant in World War I Gatsby met Daisy Fay of Louisville, and from that moment his drive fused with the limitless love he felt for her. Daisy married another, wealthier, man while Gatsby was at war. Then the war ended, and Gatsby set out to claim her. Daisy lived in splendor on Long Island. Gatsby made a fortune (don’t ask how) and bought a mansion across the bay from her. He threw fabulous parties for hundreds of people on the chance she would wander by. When she didn’t, he found other means of pursuit. The novel sounds highly plotted, but in fact the narrative is slight. The story is held aloft by Fitzgerald’s dazzling, idiosyncratic descriptive style. His narrator, Nick Carraway (Daisy’s cousin and Gatsby’s neighbor), takes the reader through Jazz Age New York apartments, Long Island palaces, and coal-smoked wastelands with a keen eye and a singular verve. He answers the question asked by almost everyone taking up the novel – Why is Gatsby great? – in part by contrasting him with the feckless fops who attend his parties. While the partygoers slosh through liquor, babble inanities, and smash up Rolls Royces, Gatsby single-mindedly pursues his dream of love. He enjoys the trappings of wealth, but he would throw his mansion, his car, and every last silk shirt on one of the novel’s famous ash heaps if doing so would win him Daisy. What about Daisy? To many readers she comes off as shallow and, at story’s end, even callous. Why does Gatsby love her? The question is unanswerable. I think Fitzgerald daringly placed an unsympathetic character at the center of Gatsby’s affections to show that love is experienced by the individual, not the multitude.For me, having read the novel more than once over the course of many years, the title fits its subject. As for Daisy, I don’t love her. In fact, I don’t even like her. But what of it? I’m not The Great Gatsby. "
925,Cheyenne Bagans❤,"The Great Gatsby is by far one of my all time favorite books. It's one of those classics you can read over and over and never get bored of it. From Jay's love for Daisy, to Tom having Myrtle on the side, and Nick witnessing it all. This book touches all aspects of life in the 1920's during prohibition. This is one book I can read over and over and never get tired of. "
926,Shawn Thrasher,"Like it or hate it, The Great Gatsby pervades our culture. I had a friend who threw a huge over-the-top party a few years ago, and describing it later, he said it had been ""like a Gatsby party."" We all knew what he meant; the title character has become a metaphor for excessive exuberance bordering on crassness (perhaps future generations will refer rather to the Kardashianian than the Gatsbyan, after the Huns finally sack Rome). The Great Gatsby, for better or worse, serves as a handy stand in for the Roaring 20s as well - Gatsby walks hand in hand with flappers, bathtub gin and Calvin Coolidge. Fitzgerald's carefully crafted writing is what creates this sense of longevity; he is truly a master of setting the scene in this novel, whether it's at one of Gatsby's bashes, languidly lounging with Daisy and Jordan in their steaming hot but well appointed Long Island mansion, or attending a gin soaked get together with Tom and his mistress Myrtle. The plot is - well, it's so ingrained in us at this point that it's hard to be objective; it's like a book out of the Bible of American Literature. I read it described as a plot Hitchcockian, what with the luxury car confusion at the very end that leads to the crazy climax. Is this the Great American Novel? With it's story of wealth and longing, it certainly probably will be in the top 10 of this elite gathering for several more lifetimes. "
927,Ryan Connors,"May be my favorite work of fiction, if for no other reason than Fitzgerald creates such a vivid and simply elegant love story in so few words. Many sentences I can pull for memory, ""I was within, and without."" Nick Carroway's character resonated with me a lot during my first time reading it, and his perspective is very interesting. I guess what I mean by that is how he can be in a blatant state of depression but still be encouraged by friendly strangers that soon become friends. In a way this is a coming of age story, but Nick doesn't come to age, as much as he gains an unspoken life lesson that can only be learned from having experienced it. I'm still trying to decide what I think that life lesson is, but for now we'll call it something along the lines of: making a really good friend, and losing them too quickly. I don't know what there is to learn from that, besides, perhaps, a further state of depression. Then again, we're all just moving ceaselessly into the past, boats against the current. "
928,María Ramírez,"First of all, me da pena haber tardado tanto con un libro tan corto, pero bueno...No sé qué esperaba de El Gran Gatsby, ya que había leído algunas reseñas que lo recomendaban pero el libro en sí no me llamaba mucho la atención, a pesar de esto me encontré con un libro muy bueno. Me gustó la forma en que está escrito, me encantó Nick y su forma de narrar la historia. Los personajes, las metáforas, el final... todo estuvo excelente."
929,Melica,I just feel that any review I can right will be a disrespect to this book!So I just can say I love The Great Gatsby!
930,Bianca Katharine  Islington,"""The loneliest moment in someone's life is when they are watching their whole world fall part, and all they can do is stare blankly.""-F. Scott Fitzgerald.Again, not sure how you write a review for such a classic novel. The Great Gatsby was such an incredible and moving book with layers too complex for a 13 year old's mind I'm sure. I really enjoyed the book though and I enjoyed reading about Nick and his relationship with the other characters. The connection between him and Jordan was very layered and complicated, very intense which I liked. He wasn't exactly in love with her, it was more of a deep fascination and admiration I think.Also Gatsby and Daisy's relationship was so heartbreakingly sweet! I loved it so much! Though on the surface Gatsby seemed to be very calm and collected on the outside, we saw various layers of his character. We saw his wild, reckless side, his nervous and agitated side and his sweet, tender side at times. ""I hope she'll be a fool-- that's the best thing a girl can be, a beautiful little fool""- F. Scott FitzgeraldAlthough we didn't see much of Daisy, Fitzgerald showed her to us in a way that really made me see some of what she felt and experience.  definitely a book I will re-read! "
931,Jose,"Jay Gatsby. He's not ""the great"" because of his money, or because of his shirts taken from England , or because of his exclusive cars.You'll have to discover who Gatsby is on your own. Fitzgerald will give you clues little by little. But you won't know who Jay Gatsby is until the very last chapter. Only then you will be able to put all the pieces together and, perhaps, just as me, you might have to re-read the whole book again to understand his complex and beautiful personality.Fitzgerald also describes us how society was organized at the time, how they suffered, and how they got a good time. When I was reading this book, I wondered: ""What am I doing here instead of dancing at one of Gatsby's parties?"". I really wanted to be there, and I think that's what Fitzgerald wanted us to feel.You will learn lots of things when you're done. But, if you want my advice, please read this book slowly. Taste every sentence. Think about what you're reading, which is not apparent. ""The great Gatsby"" is not intended for quick consume. This is Literature, starting in capital letter. Thank you and enjoy. :)"
932,Chelsea Nelson,it is a classic for a good reason. it rules. 
933,Brian Willis,"If The Great American Novel is the work of fiction that most encapsulates the idea of the US within a timeless narrative, The Great Gastby is that book. If I were to compile a list of my favorite prose passages of all time, there are probably about 20 from this novel that would make the list. Certainly one of the most beautifully lyrical books of all time, it is nonetheless far from perfect as Fitzgerald acknowledged. But we're not looking for perfection. Gatsby, the character, is a deeply flawed human being shrouded in a mist of idealism and idealization, and that in a nutshell is America itself as well. As Nick observes at the very end of the novel, in the passage that seals this novel's place in history for me, like Gatsby, Americans are constantly reaching forward for the future of the green light, for financial security and/or excess and love. And yet, we are constantly tied down by our past as well, by the initial sins of the fathers and the foundational laws that ensure that the Tom Buchanans of the world will always win. Gatsby is the ultimate cautionary tale in socioeconomic mobility. Fitzgerald was always a massive fan of John Keats and in this book, he achieves that level of sensuous beauty and tragic dimension with his own story. He knew that the book was a great one, and so did the critics. It transcends the 1920s and becomes a parable for all time. I will never get tired of re-reading this book as I have on the number of occasions since I first read it in 1992."

935,Laurie Notaro,"A classic, certainly, but everyone in this book is a sociopath. Any romance, wit, charm, is washed right out of it once you reread it after the age of 30."
936,James Wataba,"A real classic look into the American dream and the nature of wealth. Short, sweet, and simple. Too bad no producer has able to make a film worthy of the book. Fitzgerald's writing style is quite distant and aloof, but fits rather well considering the overall theme. How tragic that Gatsby's head-over-heels tunnel vision made him ""pushing up Daisies"". I somewhat wish, however, that Fitzgerald had included more narrative on why Gatsby felt so strongly about Daisy. Yes, she's rich, but I doubt Gatsby was after her money as he pursued her despite becoming rich himself; in fact, he got rich BECAUSE of, and as part of, his pursuit for Daisy. Thus, the reader really can't help but wonder what Gatsby saw in her and whether Daisy is actually a good allegory for the American dream - or maybe that's the point? Regardless, 'The Great Gatsby' (the book) truly is great (the character himself is questionable in this regard) and is worthy of being called the ""Great American Novel""."
937,Olivia Harrison,"The Great Gatsby By F.Scott Fitzgerald is often dubbed a classic and there is no doubt in my mind that it is deserving of its title. The authors purpose for writing this book is up to the reader, but interpreted by myself as to entertain and inspire.Its no secret that since the creation of The Great Gatsby it has been inspiration for authors everywhere due to its vivid descriptions of lavish party's turning grotesque, its lively poetic narrator and its discovery of the human soul. The themes of this book is of the rich and the poor, and how they are as much the same as they are different and that no amount of money can put a ""rank"" on your soul. As Our narrator Nick Carraway states ""They're a rotten crowd your worth the whole damn bunch put together."" The books is written in narration style as spoken by Nick Carraway our metaphorical, paradoxical and foreshadowing ""guest"" to a new class of the rich and riotous.The story is told in pas-tense since Nick has already experienced the events and this serves well because Nick analyzes the past situations beautifully for example ""People came and went from Gatsby's backyard like moths among the whisperings the champagne and the stars."" I loved this book because it is beautifully written startlingly true and bitter sweet. I would not change a thing about this book. It is one of the best stories i have read about love and the human heart not likely to be surpassed or compared to any other story. "
938,Carolina Morales,"I will divide this review in three parts. The first about the book, the second about the 1974 movie and the third about the 2013 screen version.I) This novel deserves to be called a 'masterpiece'. In Semantics, you have a concept referred to as the 'Semiotic Square', which is a valuable implement to analyse art oeuvres. The semiotic square measures the development of main themes according to previously established parameters, such as: Pride opposed to Humility, Love vs. Hate, Nature vs. Culture, Wealthy vs. Poverty, Wisdom vs. Ignorance, Identity vs Annonimate. The Great Gatsby, in a concise manner, presents so many possible squares that you can offer an interpretation based on almost anything.Jay Gatsby is a self made millionaire, whose gold comes from unjustified sources, which leads others to doubt the legitimacy of his wealth. He is clearly obessed with his former fiancée, Daisy Buchanan, currently married to Tom Buchanan, a brute polo player with a very noisy lover, who calls him inceasantly even at dinner time. The situation becomes unbearable when Gatsby shows up with riches and style far more attractive than Tom's rude behaviour, culminating in an ultimatum demanding Daisy to admit she has never loved Tom, which is untrue. Torn between the fascination beyond sense of Gatsby and Buchanan's pragmatical worldly existence, Daisy stays in her sheltered dumbness and lets Gatsby alone to be murdered by Tom's lover husband, lead to think Jay had driven over his wife (when actually Daisy was the one driving Jay's iconic car). II) The 1974 movie starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow is excellent. Its inspiring interpretations and 1920 aesthethic reproduction are both outstanding.III) The 2013 movie starring Leo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan is a play delight to the eye. It's very colourful and no less well interpretated than the previous big screen version. I also recommend Lana Del Rey's soundtrack, Young and Beautiful - as a Philosophy & Literature graduated, Lana has suceeded in a very deep level to catch the essence of this tragic love.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_1aF..."
939,Thiago Braun,"Um excelente livro. Talvez eu esteja levemente impressionado pela qualidade narrativa de Fitzgerald, ou pelas tiradas sarcástica contra sociedades hipócritas."
940,Michael Armijo,"How can anyone NOT give this book 5 stars? I appreciated the foreword, preface, afterword, explanatory notes & the notes about the author by Matthew J. Bruccoli which enlightened my eyes before I started on the path of reading The Great Gatsby.It's funny that somehow my high school English teacher skipped this as required reading for me in the mid to late seventies. I bought the book for my niece, Ashley, a few years ago. I remembered a co-worker, Kim, who was an avid reader who once told me that The Great Gatsby was her all-time favorite book. I was curious. It's strang that it took my 17 year old niece to 'get me on the bandwagon' to finally read this classic book at age forty-one. It amazes me to realize that the author, F. Scott Fitzgerald, died at age forty-four in Southern California on December 21, 1940, believing himself a failure.It's quite clear that Fitzgerald's ideas may have been 'made up' but he sued real life people, his own experiences and other true events to make his story.In retrosprect, the novel contains a story of money, greed, love, deceit, suspense, hate, alcoholism, stress, passion, time, ambition, death, life, status, 'leaving a mark in life', pleasure, vacation, free time, heroes, lies, trust, women vs. men, the 1920s, mystery, intrigue, romance, poor vs. rich, Sundays in the park, art, happiness, choices, fashion, lust, loneliness, friendship, adventure, honesty, making conversation, scenic views, people, music, dance, avoidance, communication, observation, summer, intelligence, panic, forgetting, agin, laughter, family values, prejudice, jealousy, past, future, youth, tranquility, grief, responsibility, self-improvement, self-actualization, carelessness, escaping and living life. "
941,Melanie,"This book is hands down AMAZING! What i love about it is the mystery it leaves you with. Its up to interpretation from beginning to start:In today's capitalist America the idea of wealth’s equivalence to power is not a new idea but a reoccurring mentality. In the 1920’s this idea was at it’s peek; Nordic relations and white supremacy. It is no secret the Fitzgerald wrote about his experience, thoughts, and emotions and The Great Gatsby being no exception. Fitzgerald claimed The Great Gatsby to be his most carefully crafted work, thus, it’s been a topic of conversation for decades. Throughout the 1920s, flappers, Prohibition and the idea of the American Dream were at it’s peak.Daisy, is a topic of conflicting views in Fitzgerald’s novel. Daisies, otherwise described as small grassland plant (family Compositae) that flowers with a yellow disk and white rays. In most film versions of The Great Gatsby, Daisy was portrayed as a blonde although Fitzgerald is very clearly states that Jordan Baker is blonde, and Daisy's hair is, if not black, a very dark shade of brown.Nick Carraway's describes Daisy’s hair to be ""a damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek,.."" or as describes by Gatsby ""once he kissed her dark shining hair....""Might Daisy be part black or ‘yellow’? The texture, thickness, and manageability of Daisy’s hair is also different. Daisy is more often than usual brushing and pinning her own hair, as if it is unruly, a characteristic not depicted to other characters in the novel. Daisy says of her daughter Pammy that ""she has my hair,"" its a reasonable argument to believe it not in color. Although, it is a fact that for Pammy is blonde. Daisy’s hair may or may not be a gene passed down from her “1/11th” “yellow” gene. But Daisy’s skin color might not be purely white either. Daisy avoids the sun whenever she can. When Nick accompanies Daisy to Jordan’s golf tournament she insists on sitting in the shade under the veranda whereas Jordan Baker, a professional golfer, makes her living out in the sun. Even when going into the city with Gatsby, Tom, Jordan and nick she decides to ride to New York in the coupe rather than Gatsby's open convertible. Would it be because she doesn't want to catch a tan? Daisy tries really hard to hide he unique individuality, especially since because of Toms Nordic ways. The ration might be a small but it is of importance to her as much as it is to Tom.Does Daisy posses more than that which meets the eyes? Daisy’s race/ethnicity is a characterization of Tom. Tom a complex, Nordic outspoken character. His masculinity alone is intimidating, but Tom is also has an unusually high or exaggerated sense of masculinity. His mistress, jealousy toward Gatsby and Daisy, authoritative action towards Nick and tension when around Gatsby, a wealthy powerful man symbolize his need or control, order and power. It is not doubt Tom is aware of Daisy’s un-pure being. When Tom argues that ""'these books are all scientific,'"" and that ""'it's up to us,who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things,...'"" Daisy whispers ""'we've got to beat them down,' winking ferociously toward the fervent sun."" She blinks back tears? “...Besides, Nick's going to look after her, aren't you, Nick? She's going to spend lots of weekends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very good for her. ""Daisy and Tom looked at each other a moment in silence.""Is she from New York?” I asked quickly.""From Louisville.” Daisy replied. “Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our beautiful white-- "" At which point she is abruptly cut off by Tom, who asks ""'Did you give Nick alittle heart-to-heart talk on the veranda?'"" to which Daisy responds“Did I?” Looking at Nick. “I can't seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure we did. It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know -- “Tom interrupts and advises her, “You can't believe everything you hear, Nick.” … Daisy tries really hard to hid her true identity around other.“Stand up now, and say -- How-de-do.'"" A southern greeting occasionally used by the daughters of aristocratic southern families, having been raised in the home by their African-American nannies. Daisy speech is influenced parents' domestics; on the other hand, perhaps it is a trait she obtained from her unorthodox family. Is there possibility of Daisy being the child of black man? A Southern woman would never admit to it and would always try to hid her views. And the possibility of Daisy being the daughter of a white man are slim, especially during such segregated times. A true southern woman would hide her error.This novel raises various question on Fitzgerald views or society, and race. The Great Gatsby is a novel often referenced to when trying to depict the era of 1920s. The standard definition of beauty is often depicted a your typical “golden girl,” but Daisy was just golden in wealth. A wealth she attempted to use to cover her distinction from the crown. To Daisy wealth was an escape. She is a character that lacked desire because she had to space to dream. Her world is corrupted by her husbands Nordic thoughts, her own insecurities and fear. For Daisy Gatsby symbolized that escape, and rebirth of opportunities"
942,Jack Streicher,"The Great Gatsby, a novel by F. Scott. Fitzgerald, is told by the main character Nick Carraway. Nick is Daisy Buchanan's cousin and Gatsby's neighbor for most of the book. The entire book revolves around Jay Gatsby, Nick's billionaire neighbor, and his one desire. His one desire is to be reunited with Daisy Buchanan, his one love that he had years back when he was in the army. Jay’s journey to reunite with Daisy leads him from very poor to very rich, reuniting with the girl he has been waiting for, and eventually to his death. The Great Gatsby was published in 1925, and known as one of the most classic pieces of american literature. The genres the novel covers are social commentary, jazz age, and American fiction. Fitzgerald did a fantastic job capturing a cross-section of american society. In this novel, there were plenty of major thematic topics, motifs, and major symbols. The major thematic topics are the decline of the American dream in the 1920’s, social issues, prohibition, and displaced spirituality. The motifs in the book are weather, geography, and types of money. The major symbols are the green light, the valley of ashes, the eyes of T.J. Eckleberg, and Gatsby’s parties.The Great Gatsby is hands down the most interesting and entertaining book I have read. Fitzgerald kept me hooked throughout the entire book. I never wanted to put the book down at any point. I like the way Nick tries to reserve judging others characters, and Fitzgerald still manages to criticize through his narrator's tone. Overall, I was engaged every page of the novel and I encourage anyone who loves classic American literature to give The Great Gatsby a try. "
943,Krzysztof,"Wielki GatsbyNie ukrywam, że zacząłem przygodę z tą książką od obejrzenia ekranizacji. Była to próba, przynajmniej tak myślałem uwspółcześnienia, uatrakcyjnienia tekstu bazowego, z jakim zmierzył się reżyser. Nie wiem, czy to kwestia tłumaczenia, czy też samej powieści, ale moim osobistym zdaniem ona tego kompletnie nie potrzebowała.Historia sama w sobie jest dość uniwersalna, autentyczna i co więcej wytrzymuje próbę czasu. Po przeczytaniu od razu zrozumiałem, skąd taki pomysł na ekranizację, tak mocno bazującą na walorach wizualnych. Język pisany zdecydowanie pozwalał na stymulowanie wyobraźni w odpowiedni sposób.Same postaci wydają się być ciekawe, ich motywy nie są od razu oczywiste, intryga, historia, relacje międzyludzkie przedstawione są w sposób interesujący. Wydaje mi się, że to co jest największym atutem tej powieści to zdecydowanie główny bohater. Osobiście jestem zachwycony tym jak pisarz stymuluje wyobraźnię, przywiązuje nas do postaci, fascynuje ich relacjami, a także przedstawia dylematy moralne każdego z nich. Klasyk i pozycja absolutnie niedoceniona."
944,Caroline Mattise,"The Great Gatsby	Nick Carraway unknowingly finds himself in the mist of precarious situation in the town of West Egg. Nick meets up with his friends Tom and Daisy Buchanan who reside in East Egg. A man named Jay Gatsby, who lives next door to Nick in West Egg, is reliving his romance with Daisy Buchanan and he wants to continue where they left off. Nick is the ligament that connects them once again, and the rest is history. One night as Daisy drove home, she struck a woman with her car. The woman's husband, Wilson, identifies the car and takes a ride over, with his gun, to Gatby's house. Nick later breaks off all ties with his friends in East Eggs, including his new found love Jordan Baker. Nick then states that “The loneliest moment in someone’s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly”, as he stares at his own life blankly. 	The Great Gatsby is a mysterious and intriguing novel. F. Scott Fitzgerald created a dramatically pleasing masterpiece. Having Nick Carraway narrate the story allows the readers to see a different point of view. They are able to receive the narrators feelings towards the different situations. However, this means that the reader is unaware of the others characters' emotions. The reader is still able to infer the different emotions of the characters. The mind never wanders while reading The Great Gatsby, the reader is always interested and wondering what will happen next.	 The book quickly begins to escalate to its miraculous climax. Once the climax is reached the conclusion seems to be there in no time. It may seem as though the book is becoming predictable, but just wait, the ending is a surprise and a half. 	The reader will find themselves excited and talking out loud, perhaps even screaming about the story as they read. It is as though the reader is right there in New York experiencing the whole thing. How mysterious the world can be, for people are never who they say they are."
945,Evan,"Characters: Nick Carraway: Main character, narrator. Lives in East Egg. 5/5Jay Gatsby: Highest secondary character. Nick's neighbor and friend. Very wealthy. 5/5Tom Buchanan: Husband of Daisy. Very concieted and wealthy. 3/5. (Well described but unlikeable.)Daisy Buchanan: Wife of Tom. Gatsby is in love with her. Nick's Cousin. 5/5. All of the character's (5) in The Great Gatsby were very well described and seemed very real. By this I mean that their relationships wit eachother and their actions all seemed very believable and do not seem like they are made up. The quote “Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead” is said by a character named Meyer W. and it shows the characters' outlook on others. They try to show eachother their feelings because they realize that life does not go on forever. They stay true to themselves by sticking with their original ideals and morals. Gatsby tries to get the woman that he loves; Nick keeps it undercover and doesn't reveal that they are in love; and Daisy is consistant with her need for love and attention to be with Tom and Jay. The Great Gatsby's setting (5)is in New York in the early 1920's. The Island is separated in to two sections called The East and The West Egg. Nick lives in the West egg, which is the less wealthy of the two. Even though Gatsby is very wealthy, he lives in the West egg also. In the 20's, alcohol was illegal but was sold illegally. Nick says his house is ""squeezed between two places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a year"" (Fitzgerald, 14). The setting is very important to the story. It is described in a very elegent manor and is a key to Gatsby's love for Daisy. The separation of the two ""Eggs"" gives Gatsby motivation to keep loving her. The story is told in fairly fast timing. It kept me interested throuout the whole book. The plot of the story (4) is told in chronological order. I did not expect the ending, as it was a bit of a twist. It showed sides of the characters that weren't foreshadowed very obviously. I don't think many people would've guessed the ending with Gatsby, but the fact that the story is written about him shows that something grand would happen. The story shortened in to a few sentences is Nick is fascinated by Gatsby's wealth and attitude towards life and Daisy, who is married but he is still in love with her. Nick helps Gatsby out of his awe for him, without letting other people know. “The loneliest moment in someone’s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly"" (65) shows that the characters really want eachother to be happy, but it can cause many things to go wrong. One of the main themes (5) of this story is that the ""American Dream"" was diminishing in the 1920's. The people in the book are all in the upper class but most of them don't earn their way up, they are given the money fro their family's wealth. The original American Dream was about being individual and living a good life but money has corrupted this. THe seperatioin ofthe East and West egg finiancially shows that people were given the choice between two almost identical places but chose one over the other just because they would seem more wealthy. Gatsby's goal of loving daisy is ruined by difference in social class, which makes him do things that he regrets, just to impress her. My overall rating for this book is a 4.75/5. I really liked the development and description of the characters. The descriptions of the settings were very poetic and the last page is very beautiful. I would recommend this book to anybody that is looking for a book that they will be very interested in the characters. :)"
946,Allison Urban,"Love Gatsby, love Nick, love Daisy. The ending was so unexpected! "
947,Kailyn Trainer-Walters,"I have a thing for books that are adapted into movies. I really like to compare them both.I hadn't read Gatsby in high school, like most of my friends. I read To Kill a Mockingbird, twice. I switched school my junior year, and my new school was reading TKAM, which I had just read the year before. That year my friends were Gatsby. As a romanticist, I'm surprised I didn't read Gatsby sooner. I knew it in reference, the roaring 20's, the fashion, the ostentatious art noveuau Gaudi-ness. Finally after the movie came out I decided I would read the book so I could watch the movie and compare them.I know a lot of people consider this a classic, and I can see why. I expected the book to be longer, and was surprised it took me only a day and a half to read the whole thing.I felt present in the world Fitzgerald created, and I really loved the idea of things not only being what they appear. I did not know before I read the book that Gatsby dies, and I was seriously shocked when I read this. Killing of the main character? I liked how shocked I was to read that. I am a huge fan of romantic storylines that involve affairs, and all consuming love, and obsession. Gatsby definitely delievered for me. Although I didn't particularly care for Daisy's character, most of my dislike was how flakey she was. I also loved the sadness this book portrayed. At the end, no one comes to Gatsby's funeral except his one friend, Nick. A man who was supposedly adored by all, was ultimately alone, and this message really hit me in the feel spot. Gatsby had everything, but yet he still wanted something he could never truly have: The prefect moments of the past. He kept trying to recreate his happiest moment. I enjoyed all the secrets everyone confided in Nick, this poor guy who gets to be stuck in the middle of everyone's drama. He is the only one who has his head on right in the book, and as that breath of fresh air, I enjoyed his character quite a bit.I really enjoyed this book, and I enjoyed the movie as well. DiCaprio did a wonderful job portraying the depth and control of Gatsby, and Toby McGuire is a perfect awkward and trusting Nick. I definitely recommend this book."
948,Maggie,"My English teacher assigned this for American Lit, I class where I despised almost ever book we read. I was surprised to find this book incredibly enjoyable. I love the characters and their interactions, and the symbols are nice but not annoying like in The Scarlet Letter. A great read!"
949,Brendan Rodriguez,"	The Great Gatsby is the story of Nick Carraway’s life after moving from the northern state of Minnesota into the Long Island, New York district known as West Egg. Nick’s neighbor, Mr. Jay Gatsby, is a World War I hero who lives in a humongous mansion. Nick is a Yale graduate, and unlike Gatsby, is a very social character.	One night, Nick meets his cousin Daisy Buchannan and her husband Tom for dinner in East Egg, a higher class district of Long Island. At the dinner, Nick meets Jordan Baker, a sarcastic young woman with whom Nick has a brief relationship. After a short while, Nick is invited to one of Jay Gatsby’s infamous parties, where Jordan and he finally meet Mr. Gatsby. As Jay and Nick become friends, Nick soon discovers an unexpected connection between them. Soon, the affairs and secrets of the wealthy East and West Egg take a turn for the exhilarating as they are revealed. Then, one night changes everything.	I liked the setting of this book very much. I thoroughly enjoy the early twentieth century, especially the 1920’s. The setting of Long Island, the elegant and fancy theme of the book, and the high class characters combine to make a very enjoyable experience of reading the story of Nick Carraway. I also like the reunion of Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchannan. Both came from the south, and somehow through a turn of events, they both ended up in New York living the high life. The chances that these two would have ended up seeing each other again are slim, yet their paths cross once again in an unpredictably magical way.  Fitzgerald is a fantastic writer; I do plan to read more of his works in the near future."
950,Phil,"Like ""The Catcher in the Rye"" this was a book that I'd read many years ago and was coming back to at a time in which it seems to have slipped down the critical scale - no longer the automatically accepted ""classic"" it once was. So I wonder if what I remembered matched what I'd read this time around. But I needn't have worried. The Great Gatsby is one of those perfect gems of a novel - like Jane Austen and her ""square inch of ivory"" it places a tiny portion of American society under a microscope and exposes its hollowness, its futility and its savagery. Gatsby, appearing from nowhere, is feted and surrounded by glamour and vitality and music and excitement, but ultimately left with nobody and nothing. His vision, his dream, of an ideal love that's driven him through so many years of work and acquisition so he felt he could justify that love, is proved to be simply a worthless paste, stage jewel. In this glittering, jittery world of the Jazz Age nothing is worth anything other than money and the next drink and party: not learning, not spirituality, not honesty and certainly not love.The language of the book is sheer perfection. Every word, every sentence, every analogy is perfectly placed and phrased. Its in its brevity, its utter (deceptive) simplicity that its greatness lies. It's not a love affair gone bad, it's about loneliness, dreams, perception, the futility of glamour, masks, ambition, lies, - it's about so much, in so few pages, and with so little actually happening. I was entranced right the way through."
951,Jobie,"I haven't re-read Gatsby for years. After watching the 2013 movie with my boyfriend and saw how it affected him, I wanted to re-read the book. The book can be read very easily, it took me a matter of hours. When I got to the end of the book, I realized the truth of the notion that one learns something new each time one returns to a book. And Gatsby is one of those novels that MUST BE returned to periodically to be fully appreciated.Gatsby is a novel that breeds contrasting opinions from readers throughout. That is definitely a sign of a great, classic piece of literature. A book that is both loved and hated at the same time proves to be one which offends and intrigues audiences in such a vast, drastic way, that its ability to do this makes it in itself a masterpiece.It is Fitzgerald's unquestionable brilliance as a writer, his amazing style and eloquence, that gives this book its greatness. His style is elegant, brief and his narrative is impeccable. The wittiness, the humor, the sarcasm, all mixed with the sadness and depression, creates an atmosphere of life breathing through the pages. Gatsby is actually a very simple story. It lacks the complexity of a Faulkner stream of consciousness layered narrative, there's no cleverly disguised objective correlative ala Hemingway, no complicated character sketches as in Steinbeck. It is just pure and simple genius.The uses of symbolism are brilliant, such as the green light on the dock, the Valley of Ashes, their houses separated by the bay, and the eyes of Dr. Eckleburg. Gatsby's love for Daisy is not ""love"" in the sense that you or I know, but a kind of sick perversion or more aptly put - the inability for him to come to terms with his past.Gatsby is so insecure that he shrouds himself in glitter. He wants one thing he can't have so much, he surrounds himself with every other possession. He loved his mental projection of Daisy -- his ideal woman. But the Daisy he loved and the real life Daisy were as different as night and day. The real Daisy was shallow, self-centered, and materialistic. He finds that getting what you want is often the worst thing possible, and that, to be very cliche but borrow from Fitzgerald's own images in this book -- everything that glitters is not gold. The character is classic because a part of him exists in so many people.Daisy and Tom are also classic characters. Haven't we all met this shallow type that takes what it wants at whatever cost and leaves the world to clean up their messes? Daisy could not love because Daisy was not really a person. Instead, she was a one-dimensional imitiation of a human being; her husband Tom is her male counter-part; neither one is a whole person. As Nick tells us ""They could always retreat into their money.""Nick is a wonderful character because he is so like the reader. He is the man who can't help but stand on the side of the road watching an imminent disaster. There is little we can do but watch and once it happens, we can't force ourselves to turn away.In many ways, Gatsby has as much relevance today as it did for the twenties. In our super-materialistic, name brand society, people are brain-washed into pursuing Daisy-dreams of designer clothes, prestige cars and bigger, better houses.The compelling message of Gatsby is the romanticism within us all - that there is an incorruptible truth out there somewhere, if only we can maintain the focus to seek it out and the courage to embrace it when we stumble across its path. Time, love and dreams are what give value to life, and Fitzgerald shows us the truth of this statement as if it were frozen in crystal. Without doubt this book has more depth and expresses more of life in less than 200 pages than many novelists capture in a thousand pages. The novel is pure genius, on a multiplicity of scales. If you have not read this book, I would urge you to read it now. If you have already read it once, I would suggest that you re-read it; I know I will. Do not expect excitement... look for depth, meaning, symbolism and those lessons that could change your perspective of the world.""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
952,Sarovar,there are beautiful shirts in this book. really beautiful shirts.
953,Rob Blankinship,"One word: wow!I've held off reading this for so long now, even when I should have back when it was required reading for junior year (hs) english class. I'm sure I wouldn't have appreciated it nearly as much then as I have right now, shortly upon finishing.Where to start? I really do feel for Jay Gatsy, I can empathize to the point of knowing how he probably feels longing for Daisy. And of pining over the past and wanting it back. One character flaw that's tormented me for a while now is how I've felt about someone from my past, how painful it can be thinking about her still and how at times difficult it is to leave the past behind and move on. Reading this I wanted nothing more than Gatsby to come out ahead, he (and Nick) seemed like the only good ones in the story; Gatsby surely deserved better. But it's the result of chasing a broken dream. Tom's awful, but I can at least see where he was coming from. To him Gatsby deserved to die for murdering in cold blood his mistress. I found, which surprised me, Daisy to have a greater immorality than him even, refusing to stop after running down (youknowwho), having Gatsby take the fall, wiping her hands clean afterward, even choosing Tom over Gatsby... which reflected where her values lay. There's a moment in the end of chapter VII where Gatsby is hiding in the bushes around the Buchanan mansion, keeping a watchful eye out in case Tom abuses Daisy, and I felt a deal of pity and sadness over this protagonist. Again, to me he deserved better.Loved this novel, though. The motifs and symbols, and Fitzgerald's commentary on 20's America, and even Daisy intended to mirror his wife Zelda, are all just incredibly fascinating. I can see why Gatsby is regarded as one of the finest novels to come from the twentieth century."
954,Aayaam,"F. Scott Fitzgerald truly highlights one of the few aspects of humans that [I believe] is inherent: greed. His portrayal of characters and their shallow, superficial desires and the almost satirical manner in which he describes the Jazz Age makes for thought-provoking reading. A driving theme to be noted in this novel is decadence and its detrimental nature; the way in which the residents of West Egg live their lives is lavish and extravagant, to say the very least.All-in-all, Fitzgerald has created a piece to marvel at for its delicate satire, rich description, and a thorough, well-developed storyline with characters to match."
955,Barbara,"A re-read. What beautiful language. I found it much more impressive this time. Reading Careless People has helped me see more deeply into this book, as has the benefit of my added years."
956,A.K. Amirov,"He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. The Great Gatsby is the perfect novel. It's timeless; it's phenomenal. It's one of the best books I've read. I've heard a lot of things about  The Great Gatsby, some good and some bad, but this completely surpassed my expectations. For a while, it left me speechless.This is an amazing story about hope, love, and the American Dream. It is one of the best attempts at writing the Great American Novel. Undoubtedly. It's difficult to put my thought on this into words, but I'm trying.But, first: no matter what you think of classics, this isn't what you're expecting. In no way is this over imposing, or difficult to read, or slow. This probably is due to the length, but the prose is also so beautiful. Everything about this novel, to me, is ideal. Everything. No wonder people love this so much. It's amazing. I have nothing more to say. Everyone should read it, at least once."
957,Carson,"I picked up this book again because of a very odd NYT article about it last month in which immigrant high school students in NYC talked about the book. These students said that they found the book inspirational, basically saying that it was a book about the possibility America offers to enter the upper class.This was not at all how I remembered the book from high school. When I read it again, I could see how you could take a message of upward mobility from it, but ultimately it is still a depressing book, with a dark message, I think, about trusting people. The rich people in the book, other than Gatsby himself, are all pretty awful. And, the good guy loses. Maybe it is the kind of book in which you can find the messages you want."
958,Barbora,"Příjemně překvapivá kniha, která mě chytla tím, že:1) je vyprávěna ""vedlejšíma očima"" = ne hlavními postavami, pro mě velké plus, nevidím pak postavy tak zkresleně 2) Nick Carraway mi byl sympatickým hned od začátku 3) je svým způsobem zvláštní - tím narážím na závěrečnou část (či spíše posledních 40/150 stránek)4) v ní vystupovaly postavy, které bych až na výjimky za žádnou cenu nezměnila - protože pokud by k nějaké změně došlo, celý příběh by se stal nudným, suchým a nezajímavým5) jsem v ní našla : absurditu, nepochopení, pohrdání, výsměch, lítost, smutek, opovrženíPrvních (maximálně) 50 stránek jsem trochu pochybovala o bezchybnosti díla - ano, bylo dobře čtivé, ale pro mě moc ""normální"" a vleklé (po přečtení ale už vím, že bez onoho úvodu by vlastně celý příběh nemohl být vyprávěn a my se nemohli naladit na ""stejnou vlnu""). Poté nastal zlom, objevily se manželé Wilsonovi, Tom, Daisy, Jordan a ano, i samotný Gatsby. A já četla a četla, protože mi to opravdu vzalo dech, a já jsem MUSELA co nejrychleji zjistit, jak to celé dopadne.Přiznávám se, neviděla jsem ani jednu filmovou adaptaci. Očekávala jsem šťastný sladký happy-end a au-revoir, konec. Pochopitelně jsem se tedy zděsila, když jsem očima zkoumala řádky se slovy ""smrt"" a ""je mrtev"". V tu chvíli jsem bylo myšlenkami úplně pohlcená. Gatsbyho jsem si oblíbila i přes jeho některé vlastnosti (třeba mi byla trochu proti srsti jeho ulpívání na Daisy), přišel mi milý a pohodový, působil na mě kladným dojmem. Oproti Daisy, která se mi zdála povrchní, sobecká, přelétavá, nevděčná, uměla manipulovat.. a tak bych mohla pokračovat dlouho, protože jsem na ní bohužel žádnou ""plusovou"" vlastnost nenašla (pokud vynechám fakt, že byla působivou osobností , zároveň plná živoucí energie a, když budu citovat Nicka, tepla)Žádná jiná literární postava než Gatsby mě zatím nedonutila tak přemýšlet nad oním ""co by, kdyby.."".A jsem ráda, že to byl právě on a ne někdo jiný. "
959,Kenneth,"Now I am not some fancy College English major, but just one who loves to read.I honestly read this out of rebellion towards my parents. My father saw the movie and read the book while in college. When a friend mentioned it to me I asked him about it and he forbade me to read because it's full of ""pornography"" but he wouldn't go into further detail on the matter, so out of curiosity, I rebelliously read this book. (It had nothing pornographic in it by the way)The characters weren't done all that good and I heard that it was a classic for it's history references but I didn't find any or notice. I don't think the characters were that good because F. Scott Fitzgerald didn't really go into any detail with them. I think that's why the love triangle was so intriguing, because nothing else was going on.The symbolism made up for everything in the end though! I loved it how Gatsby would throw these massive and expensive parties just to fill the gap or hole in his heart when he lost Daisy to the war then to another man. He never really thought he could be with her again while she was stuck in an abusive relationship with another man.It wasn't very clear how Gatsby made his money. It leaves it up to the reader how he did, which I enjoyed! It is during the time of prohibition so I decided to choose Gatsby as the type of man who ran a lot of Speak-Easy and underground alcohol trafficking. The narrator, Nick, eventually becomes very close friends with Gatsby and gets to hear his side of the story and how he loved and still loves Daisy. Then, as tragedy happens, Gatsby takes the blame of a terrible car accident where a women died in a hit-and-run. He loved Daisy so much he takes the blame when in was really her behind the wheel.My most favorite symbol that I noticed right when I finished the book was; when Gatsby dies only a few show up at his funeral, even though he held so many parties because he was so so rich. He supposedly had hundreds of ""friends"" and everyone knew his name. But in reality they weren't friends with the man, they were friends with his cash and parties. Money does not buy a true friendship, only time and experiences do.I love this book and I recommended it to all of my friends and family! (Except my father of course)"
960,Georgina Koutrouditsou,"Σε κερδίζει από την πρώτη παράγραφο:""Όταν ήμουν νέος και πολύ πιο τρωτός, ο πατέρας μου μου είχε δώσει μια συμβουλή που ξανασκέφτηκα πολλές φορές από τότε.""κάθε φορά που νιώθεις τη διάθεση να επικρίνεις κάποιον"", μου είχε πει,""να θυμάσαι ότι όλοι οι άνθρωποι δεν είχαν τις δικές σου ευκαιρίες στη ζωή"". "
961,Dan Hajducky,"How is one to go about writing a review of one of the greatest novels ever written, by one of the greatest authors who ever lived? A daunting task, this is. Let me start off by saying, in high school, I didn't particularly care for this novel. I read it, of course, but I was a pretty serious jock back then, and it was a matter of assigned reading, a have-to and not a want-to. I was being recruited to play soccer in college, so a B+ average and the bare minimum of schoolwork was good enough for me at the time. However, I was lucky enough that when my athletic career was dying down towards the end of my undergraduate studies, my literary hunger was ignited--or reignited, I should say, as I was a voracious reader in my pre-high school days. I equate my rediscovery of novels to the finding of a stylish shirt in your closet that you had forgotten you owned; you pull the smooth fabric off the hanger, hold it out in front of yourself, incredulous, eyes-wide and jaw agape, saying, ""Has this really been here all along?"" This was my reaction to the world of literature a few years ago. I had come home one weekend to Trumbull from Southern CT State University in New Haven. I was in my junior year, nineteen years old, just having transferred from Fordham University in the Bronx. I ventured into my brother's room after the Jets game had ended (God...those freaking pesky Jets) and I found a copy of The Great Gatsby that my brother had kept from high school. The game had ended, all of my homework had been completed (don't worry, I picked my grades up in college, graduating cum laude and a full year earlier than I was supposed to) and I didn't have to drive back to school for a few hours. I plopped down on my bed, and got to reading good ol' Fitzgerald. The book hit me...hard. My reaction to the novel was a completely different one than my fifteen year-old self had concocted. I wondered if it was even really the same book. After finishing it an hour or so later, I flipped it over and over, my mind racing, my heart pumping, searching the covers for some invisible secret that would give me answers--why hadn't I recognized its brilliance before? I raced into the living room, my parents exchanging concerned looks as I yapped on about Gatsby, Nick, and Daisy, in between running down and back up the stairs. I found other books in the house, asking my parents about each one. Who wrote this, and what's this about, and is this one any good. I brought all the ones I could find back to school with me later that night, and started reading with fervent passion. I had to catch up with everyone else, after all. Now, it's three years later, I'm in an MFA in Creative Writing program, and I haven't stopped reading since.That was the second time I had read F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece and it hit me like a bulldozer. I have since read the novel twice more, and each time I have discovered something new about the book. I can't write the perfect review about The Great Gatsby, nor can I summon the perfect words. What I can say is that I feel that it is literary perfection. I can say that my story is what makes The Great Gatsby such a classic, such a perfect work of art: the best books written are the ones whose meaning changes each time you read them. The truly timeless books are the ones that change as the reader changes. I truly feel sorry for the people who don't think Fitzgerald's book is a brilliant cornerstone of literature, because it is a novel that has quite literally changed my life.The Great Gatsby"
962,Rachel Bergman,"The story of the mysterious Mr. Jay Gatsby, told by his neighbor Mr. Nick Carraway, deserves a solid five out of five. The novel is fast-paced, therefore keeping you intrigued in the plot. The wording is confusing at times, especially the odd similes and phrases used. These, however, can be decoded enough to understand the events. I would suggest anyone with a mature enough mind to read great tragedies. ""The Great Gatsby"" brings you into the complicated lives of not necessarily Nick Carraway, in which it is narrated, but rather Mr. Gatsby and the Buchanan family. Nick, after moving to West Egg, is thrown into complicated marriages and affairs. His second cousin, Daisy, is married to a cheating man, Tom. Daisy, however has secrets of her own. Nick's neighbor, Mr. Gatsby, was Daisy's first love, who she has not completely forgotten. Gatsby lives across the bay from Daisy and is still madly in love with her, so he throws extravagant parties, hoping one night she might wander in. Whether he is a murder, Oxford man, or a German spy, Gatsby is mystery to all. Tom finds out about Daisy and Gatsby, and is oddly outraged, even though he has his own side-woman. The rest is for you to figure out, but the question that will probably forever haunt your mind is: Who really is Mr. Jay Gatsby? "
963,✿.Ⓐⓟⓞⓞⓡⓥⓐ.✿,"Undoubtedly Fitzgerald's greatest novel, The Great Gatsby showcases his undeniable understanding of unfulfilled lives plagued by greed and illogical longing. Gatsby concentrates his entire life on being with Daisy, a girl who honestly doesn't deserve a man half as good (or should I say ""great""?) as Gatsby. If there is one thing that saddens me about this novel it is that Gatsby spent his life on someone so unworthy of his love and obsession.The message that speaks to me the most is that Gatsby, though a noble and well-meaning man, has very rotten values due to the focuses of society. Society has done wrong by him, and his life is therefore given close to no meaning. It outlines the American dream perfectly, especially its flaws at the time and the skewed view many people had of it.The reason I give it 4.5 stars (rounded up to 5) is because of one small thing I didn't agree with throughout the book. Jay Gatsby has an obsession with his past, that is true. However, he is not attempting to relive it... He is trying, rather, to rebuild it."
964,Komal,"Ah, Fitzgerald. There isn't really any other author I've experienced whose writing is so crystalline, so sharply acute and whose characters seem so much like they're formulated on dreams and movies.The book is regrettably short but says everything it intends to and more. The air of a gently unfolding tragedy hangs over every page. "
965,Killian,"RATING: 8.9/10Review Summary: The perfect portrayal of an entire generation, from its highs to its lows, its comedies to its tragedies, its glories to its vices.The Great Gatsby is one of the most perfectly heartbreaking, timeless and memorable novels that I have ever read. Within these short 180 pages, Fitzgerald crafted a masterpiece that sums up the zeitgeist (OOH! Big word) of the Jazz Age. It at once revels in the empty decadence of 1920's society, while also condemning it. The beautiful prose perfectly matches the almost dreamlike nature of the book and I can really see why The Great Gatsby has become one of the most well-respected and beloved books of the last century. With this book, F. Scott Fitzgerald created a masterpiece.For those of you who don't know, the plot centres around the character of Jay Gatsby, a wealthy but reclusive millionaire who throws lavish parties but seems to harbour some dark secret. It's told from the point of view of Nick Carraway, Gatsby's neighbour as he witnesses Gatsby come out of his shell...First and foremost, the writing in The Great Gatsby is beautiful beyond compare. It manages to be sensuous, haunting and lyrical, while at the same time it remains eminently readable, compelling and accessible. Fitzgerald sucks you in with his prose and does not let go. My opinion of writing quality has always been that a good writer is not a writer who uses big words, but a writer that uses the right words, and Fitzgerald kind of manages to do both. In short, The Great Gatsby is beautifully written and had me hooked pretty early on. It's also insanely quotable, which is also a big plus.Every now and again, there comes a book that manages to strike at the heart of its generation. There are very, very few novels that manage to do this, but The Great Gatsby is certainly one of them. As I've said, no other book so brilliantly portrays the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess. It truly manages to sum up that era. It shows the us its lazy apathy, its frenetic activity, its gluttonous excess, it empty vanity and its vapid posturing in a cool,detached light. Its portrayal of the society of the time is damning, bold and about as near to perfect as is humanly possible. I also think that the way Fitzgerald condemns the shallow, empty nature of many of the characters is definitely relevant in this modern era, and that may be one of the reasons why The Great Gatsby is such an enduring classic.The characters are great too. Our narrator, Nick Carraway, I felt was a perfect fit for the story. He was very detached from society, so I think that meant that the story could just happen around him, which was essential seeing as Gatsby, not Carraway, was the main character. Speaking of Gatsby, he has now become one of my favourite characters in literature. His hopeless, desperate love for one of the characters (I won't say who but you probably know already) is, simply put, heartbreaking. He is a character that has been consumed by a single, hopeless desire and Fitzgerald's portrayal of him is truly amazing. The other secondary characters, like Tom and Daisy Buchanan, were great too. I felt like they really represented the emptiness and shallowness of the upper classes at that time (and nowadays too, maybe). While they were a tad one dimensional at times, I feel like this was OK because that was why they were in the story. Also, I know a good few people who, in Irish standards, are very well off and I could easily imagine a good few of them as Tom or Daisy Buchanan.To be honest I could go on and on about how much I love this book. While I would've liked a little more character development from the narrator, I think that The Great Gatsby is one of the best books I've read in the past while. I know its only January, but I have a feeling that this is going to be pretty high on my Best Of list at the end of the year. The character of Jay Gatsby is at once totally alien yet strangely relatable and, as I've said multiple times, the quality of the writing is exemplary. While it is certainly a real cliché to say that you like this book, I'm certainly not ashamed to say that I think it's amazing. If you've been avoiding this because of the hype at the moment, let me say that it definitely deserves the praise. Also, if you're trying to read more classics this year, like me, this is a good place to start, mainly because it's filled with amazing quotes, amazing characters, amazing writing and an amazing plot. The Great Gatsby is a true classic in every sense of the word.If you want to read more of my book reviews (as well as posts about music and film) check out me blog: http://leaf-on-the-breeze.blogspot.ie/"
966,Georgiatai,This was such a well crafted and vivid story. the plot was coherent but not boring and the characters' depiction was true and cleverly done. I loved the end. it's simply one of my favorite reads thus far...
967,Laurel,I enjoyed this book in a way that I didn't know you could enjoy a classic. I didn't feel any obligation to finish this book just because its popular or because it is a highly regarded classic. I read this book simply because the words were beautiful. The way that Fitzgerald writes and the raw description he provides just made me want to keep reading. I loved how when he described things he didn't use the words in which you would ordinarily describe them and yet you still could picture everything perfectly. The only reason this is a four star instead of a five is because I could not stand Tom Buchanan and how he seems to have personality influence over daisy. I know that this further adds to the story in most ways but for me it was just so irritating and kind of took away from the big picture. Would definitely read again.
968,Lauren,"The first time I read Gatsby was a freshman in high school, too young and coerced to come away with much but an urge to slap Daisy. The second read was magic — I drank it in a night, awed by the grace of the language, and particularly swept up in the sad romance of it: gauche, hopeful Jay Gatsby, arms and dreams wide as he stared across the Sound at the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock.This third time was the best, the purest, and if you haven’t read it for a while, I urge you to pick it up again. It’s truly a masterpiece, painting the whole American mess in vivid colors and flawless perspective without wasting a stroke. The best part, the deftest, is that Fitzgerald makes everyone culpable, from philandering elitist Tom Buchanan to passive narrator Nick Carraway. Even the reader can’t help but feel involved: In the thousand wrongs and slights of everyday, in our selfish wants and our crueler rationalizations, we create and prolong the world Fitzgerald painted for us.And yes, I still want to slap Daisy."
969,Kalani Upshaw,"The novel, The Great Gatsby, takes place in the 1920's in New York. People were going against tradition and morals and doing what they pleased. Things like bootlegging, partying, fashion, etc were very popular during this time. The rich were just getting richer and the poor were getting poor. This book portrays the life of a ordinary man, Nick Carraway, who narrates his story and experiences hanging with the rich people after coming from the war. The story takes place in New York in West Egg, East Egg, and New York City. Nick lives in a decent looking house on an island in West Egg next to a mansion owned by Jay Gatsby. Nick's cousin Daisy and friend Tom live in East Egg in their mansion with their little girl. Gatsby who lives next to Nick is only in New York and throwing parties every night just so he can get to see Daisy again. He hopes that Daisy will leave Tom for him and continue where they left off five years ago before Gatsby left for the war. Gatsby lies to everyone about how he got so wealthy when really he was a bootlegger who sold alcohol and drugs. Gatsby does all this just so Daisy could see how wealthy she is and consider leaving Tom for him now that he has money. Tom, who is cheating on Gatsby with a women named Myrtle, finds out about Daisy and Gatsby little affair and all goes downhill from there. Tom and Gatsby get into a dispute over who Daisy loves and will leave with while out in the city. When they head home one night Daisy and Gatsby hit Tom's mistress with Gatsby's car and kill her. Gatsby takes the blame even though Daisy ironically killed her. Tom, Nick, and Jordan, their friend, arrive at the scene and are in shock. Tom talks to his friend Wilson, who I also Tom's mistress husband and tell Wilson that it was Gatsby's car that hit and killed his wife. Out of anger Wilson goes to Gatsby's house and shots and kills Gatsby and kills himself after. Nick arrives later wondering why Gatsby hasn't answered his calls and finds Gatsby dead. Gatsby's dad arrives for the funeral and tells Gatsby's story and who he really was to Nick.I really enjoyed this book because it was interesting and had a lot of twists to it. How the characters connected in the story was really interesting and how it ends was very shocking. The ending really showed the characters true selves. The plot line was put together very well. I like this book because it is something everyone can relate too and how America kind of is today. Fitzgerald tells the story about how Americans are living for material prosperity but are morally corrupt. It shows how wealth can change people’s moral values. This novel shows how the 1920’s society had lost their moral values and the American dream.I would recommend reading this book because it is one of those books that you must read in your life. Its the type of book that everyone can understand and relate to in someway. It also portrays the lifestyle of the rich and poor in the 1920s from someone who actually lived in that decade. So you get a real incite of what was going on during that time period. "
970,Michael,"						The Great Gatsby	The book I am reading is the one and only, The Great Gatsby. The book is written by F. S. Fitzgerald in 1925. He was born in 1896 in the city of Saint Paul in Minnesota. He was born into a middle class family. Fitzgerald was named after his famous second cousin, three times removed, Francis Scott but was referred to as Scott Fitzgerald. He was also named after his deceased sister, Louise Scott, one of two sisters who died shortly before his birth. Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald was an American author of novels and short stories, whose works are the paradigmatic writings of the Jazz Age. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century. He is considered to be part of the “lost generation”.	This book takes place in the Roaring Twenties. In the book, it starts off with Nick Carraway a bondsman and war veteran, in New York, getting a little house in West Egg. He visits his cousin Daisy Buchanan and her Husband Tom Buchanan and Miss Jordan Baker. He then returns home and notices his neighbor staring down at him. Next day, he receives an invitation to a party at Jay Gatsby's. Only one to receive an invitation, he asks around about gatsby and hears nothing but rumors. He then asks a man, very stunning man, he replies with “i Am Gatsby”. Nick and Gatsby begin to talk more and Gatsby tells him he was a war hero and he went to Oxford. Gatsby used to go with Daisy back in the day and wants her back. Tom is eager to expose Gatsby because he knows something isn't right. One day Gatsby and Nick go to the Buchanans and they go to town. In a town where they stop, which is where Tom has his mistress Myrtle. In town they all get into a fight. Gatsby and Daisy leave back in the car Tom was in which was Gatsby’s, to the buchanans. Myrtle gets into a fight with her husband. She runs out into the street and gets killed by daisy in the car that is Gatsby’s. Tom stops at the gas station to see what was the commotion to see that Myrtle was killed. He then says it was Gatsby. Gatsby is waiting for a call from Myrtle but when a call is from Nick Gatsby is found shot and killed by Wilson, Myrtle’s Husband and he then goes on to take his life.	I believe that the meaning of this book his that you can not recreate or relive the past. What's in the past is in the past there is no recreating or reliving it. The famous quote from the book that gatsby says is , “Can't repeat the past?....of course you can!”. That quote, I believe, set the meaning of the book. You knew what was going to happen when he said it. He was trying to say the past can’t comeback theres no going back so live in the present and don't let anything important to you slip away. 	In my opinion, this book is one of the best books ever. It has the right mixtures of romantic, suspenseful, mystery, etc. It has everything. This book will be talked about for years from now. This book was well written by a very smart writer. Nothing, nothing would make this book better. 	I honestly would recommend this book to everyone. This is a book you can't hate. Every Time someone asks me about a good book to read my response is, “ The Great Gatsby”, and it always will be. I would have to let them know that they will want to keep reading and reading. That they will be very very pleased with the book. "
971,Paige Bryant,"I won't lie, the initial reason for reading this book was due to my English Literature course at school. However since then I have reread the book and continuously fall in love with it. Although that long first chapter still kills me a little! Fitzgerald's language is a beautiful, his symbolism haunting and his characters unforgettable. The recklessness and carelessness is evident in us all. Although a reflection of the decadent behaviour of the 1920s it amazes me how it still reflects in modern society. The novel is a must read to all literature lovers. "
972,Nikki Bezdel,"Spell-binding. I read this book in one afternoon and found myself lost in the exceptionally beautiful narrative. Fitzgerald's prose is akin to poetry and almost sings to you from the page. The story is good, but it is not that which is breathtaking, it is the perfect use of language to express an emotion which captures you - for me, the greatest last paragraph of a novel ever written - for it's simplicity and profound truth - is to be found at the end of this great book."
973,Jo Lampert,"Yes to Fitzgerald. Ah, romance and tragedy and the jazz age. What's not to like? "
974,Douglas Hayes,"I’ve successful avoided reading The Great Gatsby for all of my 52 years, and I’m the poorer for it. What is worse, I read it because a movie is soon to be leased by that name, directed by Baz Luhrmann, whose artist flourishes I’ve greatly appreciated. I have now corrected my life-long error, and am better for it. It is a sad and tortured tale of a self-made man with longings for life he cannot have. He pulled himself up from obscurity and prospectlessness by giving himself the name Gatsby. Through passionate self-discipline and shady dealings, he became a social sensation. All so that he could create a future with the love of his life, whom he lost so many years before. It is a comic tragedy that reminds us that life cannot be so easily controlled and sculpted to our vision of it. The final lines of the book ably summarize our plight (without giving anything away): “Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eludes us then, but that’s no matter – to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther…And one fine morning-So, we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”Although we can be redeemed from our past, we cannot go back to remake our future. Our past must be accepted for what it is, and incorporated into our hopes for the future. Without a true and virtuous redemption, our past will follow us a haunting and fearful specter, threatening to ruin us in most unexpected and pitiful ways. Fitzgerald uses words masterfully and poetically so that we are compelled to pause and think about what he means by them. A rare gift indeed!"
975,Brianna,"I read this book in one day; it was sooo good. This is the first book for pleasure reading that I've read in a long time since I'm hella busy during the school year but it was a great first summer reading book! I love that it takes place in the summer; it really has a perfect summery vibe to it. The writing is so engaging and poetic without being stilted. Nick has a lovely voice.""A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about...""The chronology of it is strange; if I sat down to write a book about a young man named James Gatz who realizes his fantastical alter identity of the rich, successful Jay Gatsby, I probably wouldn't think to tell the story from Nick's perspective and in the way that he does, but it definitely works.I like Nick; he's the kind of guy with whom I could be friends. In fact, we're a lot alike. And, in some ways, Gatsby also represents for me ""everything for which I have an unaffected scorn."" I'm a very logical, rational person (so I like to think). But, like Nick, I love Gatsby all the same. He's a beautiful romantic fool.For some reason, however, Daisy fascinates me as a character. Almost from the beginning I was dying to get inside her head, maybe because her character is the type that usually ends up more as an object in a story than an actual character, merely something for our romantic young male hero to pursue, the symbolization of all his unachievable hopes and dreams. The story is named after Gatsby, of course.But I actually thought Fitzgerald did an excellent job carving out each and every of the characters.""I hope she'll be a fool—that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.""Daisy certainly has her flaws. She has a bit of the irresponsible, careless, rich girl persona. But she's definitely not empty-headed. When she's talking to Nick on the settee, it's clear that she's very perceptive of the way her life is and who she is. She's self-aware; I like that, even if she keeps on living as she does.One of my favourite books as of now. Would definitely recommend."
976,María,"Me ha gustado, empiezo por ahí porque hablar de un clásico sin saber demasiado sobre literatura norteamericana de principios del siglo XX... Bueno, hagamos lo que podamos. No hace falta ser experta en literatura para saber que la historia se ambienta en ""los felices años 20"", la época gloriosa tras la cual los Estados Unidos se sumirán en la miseria tras el crack de la bolsa en el año 1929. Evidentemente, si son los ""felices"" años 20 el libro es una fiesta constante. Nick Carraway, cuenta en pasado la historia de nuestro protagonista; Jay Gatsby, un señor misterioso que da fiestas en su casa todos los días, unas fiestas famosas por la cantidad de gorrones gente que se colaba. Pero, ¿quién es Gastby? Algunos dicen que ha matado un hombre, otros dicen que es un contrabandista, nadie lo conoce pero todo el mundo lo adora. Gatsby no es más que otro hombre enamorado, otro hombre que bebe los vientos por una chica y sí, me gustan este tipo de romances, amores prohibidos que se han cuajado durante años y no, no me gusta la romántica. La historia destila una crítica a la sociedad de la época brutal, pero sobre todo, al sueño americano. Cargada también de símbolos en forma de colores y ojos:""Un hombre con ojos de búho en una fiesta de Gatsby se sienta en la biblioteca y murmura impresionado que todos los libros son libros de verdad""No soy una experta, y probablemente me equivoque, pero me da a mí que tanto amarillo en casa de Gatsby tiene algo que ver con el dinero, la riqueza, el oro. Los personajes me han gustado, incluso a los que me gustaría escupirles, por el mero hecho de lo bien construidos que están. Por un lado está Tom, el marido de Daisy (la manzana de la discordia), un hombre altanero, mentiroso y sobre todo, infiel, y me encanta lo que Fitzgerald le guarda, porque es mi estilo. El karma siempre triunfa, aunque a veces se equivoca de persona. Por otro lado, tengo que reconocer que el principio del libro se me hizo completamente pesado, he tardado más en leerlo porque mientras que Gatsby no aparecía, la historia era demasiado sosa y me aburría bastante, pero al seguir leyendo ha sido un no parar, no poder soltar el libro ni aun teniendo que irme a trabajar. Es por eso que se ha convertido en un gran favorito. Aunque el final me ha dejado desolada, y no quiero hacer spoilers, sabía que este tipo de historias debían acabar así. Que este libro terminase de la forma que , probalemente, todos hubiésemos deseado, no habría hecho si no empeorar el clásico. Me encantan los finales tristes. Tristes pero necesarios. En ocasiones es necesario sacrificar algo para que viva toda la eternidad."
977,Susan Williams,"It's always satisfying to read a classic, even when it's an effort, but when it's a pleasure like the Great Gatsby, it's even better. I've had this on my list for a long time, started it, but got distracted and abandoned it. On a whim I picked up the book on CD version and what a treat! I'm often annoyed by the performers on audiobooks, but Gatsby is read by Tom Hanks, what a bonus!All this aside, the Great Gatsby now ranks as one of the best novels I've ever read, up there with and probably should be paired with, the Razor's Edge. It has that same feel, written from the prospective of an observant secondary character. The reader feels transported back to America in the 1920's.Nick Carraway, the narrator, is a struggling bond trader who makes the acquaintance and eventually becomes the closest friend of charming playboy, Jay Gatsby through his cousin Daisy. Initially unbeknownst to Nick, Gatsby and Daisy are former lovers and Gatsby is desperately trying to get her back. Daisy is currently married to a philandering bigot, Tom Buchanan.Nick becomes entwined in Gatsby's schemes to win Daisy along with Tom's attempts to avoid Daisy's discovery of his affairs. The story spins to an ugly confrontation and tragic accident. I won't add any spoilers although most have either read this book or seen one of the many screen adaptations but the story flowed deftly until the shocking and sad climax.Fitzgerald's writing is tight and concise and the story builds and sweeps the reader along with it. A truly timeless classic!"
978,Anne Camille,"Re-read after seeing the recent movie. Sure there were some things different in the movie, but for the most part I think it was true to Fitzgerald's book. Except for the Bollywood actor (that casting was weird), and the corny, unnecessary frame created for the movie. Fitzgerald's prose is weighted down with unnecessary flourishes - things that a writer today wouldn't be able to get away with - but nobody depicts the era better. The book still holds my interest 40 years after I first read it. I've lost count of how many times I have read it and it has been several years since my last re-read. Still, I always find something new in the novel. "
979,Susanna,"I read this book in high school and maybe once since. At a friend's suggestion I just re-read it, a few (!) years wiser now, and I was impressed with how memorable it had been to me in those earlier years, and how I remembered the well-crafted symbolism, the setting, the characters. What struck me with the re-read (as with a recent re-read of The Sun Also Rises) was the stylishness of the prose, but also its rigor -- how its spareness disguises a wisdom about the human condition, but even more so the American condition, with not too many aphorisms and observations but some very striking ones. Many of the book's themes certainly resonate still today, 90 years after its publication: social striving; the hollowness and desirability of material accomplishments, and even love, to fill the void left by our industrialized world's wars and development; the subcultures of West vs. East in the U.S.; the complexities that make up human personalities. How well Fitzgerald observed the human character, or one set of it -- ""personality is a series of unbroken gestures,"" ""enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names."" And of course, at the same time, he captures a particular point in time, when Prohibition had outlawed parties like Gatsby's, the horrors of WWI still resonated and WWII hadn't happened yet, and the privileged people in the story were worried about losing their position, whether to self-made new money or to intermarriage between the races. "
980,Just_a_dreamer,"""Ma in Gatsby c'era stato un cambiamento semplicemente sconcertante: splendeva, né più né meno: senza una parola né un gesto di trionfo, un benessere nuovo emanava da lui riempiendo la stanza.""Avvincente, intrigante, mai banale. Gatsby ci insegna a sognare, a non smettere mai di credere in qualcosa, qualsiasi cosa che ci renda felici e ci strappi un sorriso. Purtroppo però, a volte, i sogni restano ancorati al passato, incapaci di attualizzarsi nel presente. Così la ""luce verde"", il futuro incalzante che ""indietreggia davanti a noi"", che ci stringe in un abbraccio mortale, svanisce lasciando soltanto un vuoto, un buio incolmabile. "
981,Miller Sherling,They shouldn't give this book to 16-year olds. I wasn't ready for it. Finally re-read it in my late 20s. Wow.
982,Jagoda,"One of my new years resolutions was to read more classics. The Great Gatsby was a great way to start it, undoubtidly. My experience with classics isn't big and since forever I considered them to be dull. I am nearly 100% sure that school in Poland made me think this way. You see, there's no way you could compare polish classics with english/american classics (except for Quo Vadis, maybe)BUT Great Gatsby turned my classic books opinions upside down.I found The Great Gatsby such an incredible book, full of amazing, often hidden symbols and metaphoeres. I particularly enjoyed the historical aspect of a story- 1920s , criminal activity, parties with jazz music, American Dream and upper class society. Also, the wonderful (but blizzard) relationship between Gatsby and Nick made my heart melt. It was so damn beautifull and touching. I actualy read an artcle just a second after I finished the book (when I was still in a slight shock after the ending) about those metaphores and symbols that I mentioned before. (and also places and characters.) Also, I think that I'll reread it someday, when I am older, as I am not sure if I understood everything completly. Still, 5/5 stars. Wonderful!"
983,Miguel A.,"F. Scott Gerald's ""The Great Gatsby"" is a countless classic that can be interpreted a million ways. It is a story about love, no wait, the pursuit of happiness. The idea that true happiness is unreachable in a time when everything is thought to be possible and names become immortal. Read and lived through the eyes of Nick Carraway, our narrator who is or is not as honest as you may imagine. He tells us about his neighbor Gatsby who was born from New Money and business. About Daisy who has mastered the skill of illusion, masking her carless and destructive nature with the image of true perfection.I truly adored this book because of the idea it sells to the reader. It just makes you want to scream and cry and causes a lump in the throat when ever you pick it back up to continue reading. I refuse to believe that all of our work is hopeless and that dreams can not be achieved. Because of the strong ties this book has with metaphors, foreshadowing, and references to sex I can not recommend ""The Great Gatsby"" to anyone less then middle school. I give this book a perfect 5 stars since it is the only book I have ever read twice, so... it is good. The movie is not have bad either."
984,Clif Brittain,"In anticipation of the new movie, I re-read this for what must be the fourth time. I continue to marvel at how much is contained in such a slim book. What Fitzgerald captures between these covers is simply the American Dream. Lots and lots of money - money coming, money going, old money, new money, too much money, not enough money. But no happiness, especially in relation to the amount of money.My father was absolutely in awe of money. He thought that if he emulated John D. Rockefeller, he would have Rockefeller's financial success. He read what Rockefeller read, he ate what Rockefeller ate (chew every bite forty times). He never accepted that Rockefeller and Carnegie and Mellon and Ford all cheated and betrayed their way to the top. I think of my dad as a Rockefeller Republican - one of millions who think that by emulating the habits and thinking and voting of these plutocrats, one will become one of them.So too Gatsby. He thought he'd become one of them. But even if you become one of the 1%, you still aren't in. There is another requirement. You have to be accepted. You have to become validated. The requirements are nebulous and changing. This etherous society doesn't have a solid state. The American Dream is only a dream.I love the archetypal characters. Some of the dialogue I love, especially the drollness of Nick, Daisy and Jordan. The brutality of Tom. The naivety of Nick. The avarice of Wolfsheim. This time I read the book more critically than I had before and I found what I thought were some significant flaws. In previous readings, I followed the story and was not so concerned with the descriptions or the dialogue or the logic. This time I paid more attention to the writing and in many cases, I just couldn't follow it. For instance, in the opening pages, ""If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away.""First, I don't get ""personality as an unbroken series of successful gestures."" I don't think of anyone I know in terms of gestures. ""Gestures"" has the connotation of being insincere. Not one of my Goodreads friends who I know in the flesh is defined by ""a series..."" If you are in this select group, please identify one gesture you've made to me that I can identify as critical to your personality.""Heightened sensitivity to the promises of life?"" Excuse me, but Gatsby was clueless to the sensitivity of life. Maybe the promise of sensitivity to life, but he had the feelings of an anvil with regard to sensitivity. That was a pretty dumb sentence, but I think you know what I mean. ""Old Sport"" was about as sensitive as Gatsby managed. A phrase that makes me cringe. It has the sensitivity of a leash and collar.That is an example of what bothered me on closer examination. The sentence is beautiful, the simile great, the use of the word ""gorgeous"" perfectly descriptive of Gatsby. But it makes no sense in explaining Gatsby. Unless the purpose is to confuse people into thinking they know Gatsby when they don't. Did I just discover something?The logic also confounds me. ""Let's go to the city."" Why would they go to the city? They have a pool right there to cool off. Maybe you go to the city to do stupid stuff, I don't know. Why would Daisy go back with Gatsby? Why would she drive? (The explanation that it would calm her I don't buy.) I just don't get the motivations of these folks.In the other ""great American novels"", Huck Finn, Grapes of Wrath, you can follow why characters do things. In Gatsby, actions are inexplicable. Maybe they're not actions, but gestures?In regards to the upcoming movie, I anticipate being the wealth voyeur (Dad - you'll love it, he owns his own plane.). The previews promise I will be rewarded. This is what movies do best. I loved Branaugh's Hamlet, just for the interior scenes. The best part of Harry Potter were the early Hogwarts scenes. I think DeCaprio is great, but playing Gatsby would be very difficult. How do you play an invisible man? I know, gestures!I'm polishing my 3-D glasses. I'm researching the car. I can't wait to see the shirt scene. Who will be hotter, Daisy or Jordan? Exactly how hot is Myrtle? What happens to Myrtles dog? How hard will HULKING Tom hit Myrtle? How hot will it be in late summer? Will I understand the book better? I hope not. The ambiguity is the best part."
985,Carol," I am re-reading Gatsby. It is a charming read and seems somewhat quaint in2009, but why wouldn't it? It's so short and manageable. Nick Carraway tells thetale of the people he meets when he moves into a small house in East Egg. Thegrand parties that seduce him next door at Gatsby's mansion and yet Gatsby is called to the phone frequently by the staff during the soirees. The guests seem tobe the only one enjoying the flow of liquor, romps on the beach at night andthe gardens and pool. Slowly we learn the reason, Gatsby has purchased this houseso that he can long for Daisy Buchanan, the wife of Tom. They live right across the sound and Gatsby longingly peers at the green light on their dock. He is planning to have Daisy see his mansion for five years. Now Nick learns that he isto be the conduit that brings Daisy back to Gatsby. Nick just happens to be Daisy's cousin. So we enter what has become the classic tale of loveand longing among the idle set of 1920s America. Nick learns that these lives seemingly lived with abandon are not as carefree as they seem."
986,Lbball27,"gatsby will forever be one of my favorite characters....want to read more f. scottt...for a truly beautiful review just read my son's review......""so we beat on...."""
987,Jodie,One of the best books ever.
988,Katy Eyberg,"A heart-wrenching account of hopeless, lovelorn Jay Gatsby's empty life amid the Roaring Twenties. Poignant, awkward, cruel, devastating. I'm so glad student teaching has given me a good reason to return to this book. I couldn't put it down. "
989,Ian Gabogovinanana,"The True Value of Monopoly MoneyCapitalism tends towards monopoly. No capitalist welcomes a competitor or rival. Having attained wealth, the desire is to retain it, not to concede it; to increase it, not to share it. A competitor is perceived as a threat, and will be treated like a virus invading an otherwise healthy, but vulnerable, body.The Great American Dream""The Great Gatsby"" is often described as a paean to the Great American Dream.This Dream supposedly sustains the average American. It offers the opportunity to achieve success, prosperity and happiness, regardless of class, status, background or wealth.It contains a promise of upward social mobility, a reward that will be ours if we work hard enough.We all have an equal opportunity to transcend our current circumstances. Implicitly, if we fail to transcend, we have only ourselves to blame. We didn't take sufficient advantage of our opportunity. Everybody is responsible for their own failure.The Great American Dream isn't far from the Objectivist Philosophy of Ayn Rand.
Stars and stripes and silhouettes and shadows.Jay GatsbyMost readers think of Jay Gatsby as someone who took advantage of his opportunity, and made it.In that sense, he's the epitome of the Great American Dream.He has amassed enormous business wealth. He owns a colossal mansion on West Egg, Long Island. Every week, he holds a lavish party attended by all and sundry. The parties are the ultimate in Jazz Age glamour. Gatsby has achieved everything material an American could want. He has realised the Long Island real estate mantra, ""Vocation, Location, Ovation"".The Green LightSo what's Gatsby's problem?Every night, Gatsby looks across the sound to a green light on a porch, where Daisy lives in her more prestigious East Egg mansion with her husband, Tom Buchanan.Daisy is the one thing for which Gatsby yearns. She is the one thing he has sought after since he met and fell in love with her five years earlier at age 25.""The Great Gatsby"" revers that small green light. What we never see is what Gatsby's mansion looked like from Daisy's perspective at home. We aren't expressly offered a vision of Gatsby's fully-lit mansion as a counterpoint to Tom's, but that is what it is.The point is Gatsby's achievement of the Great American Dream was not the end, as it is with most Americans, it was the means to an end, and that end was winning the hand in marriage of Daisy.The most important thing about Gatsby's mansion, from Gatsby's point of view, is what it would look like to one woman across the sound.Love's Labours RetrievedGatsby has already lost Daisy once, in 1917, when as a destitute young officer during the war, he was unable to marry her, because he could not offer her a financial security that was acceptable to her wealthy mid-west family.Since then, he has acquired wealth, by whatever means necessary, to win her away from Tom and marry her.The wealth was nothing to him, the parties were grotesque bonfires of vanity, designed with one thing in mind: to attract Daisy's attention and bring her, curious, within his reach.Then, having got her within his sphere of influence, he could win her back.""The Great Gatsby"" is really about the love a man had for a woman, how he lost it and what he did to regain it.At one point, Gatsby talks about repeating the past. I don't see him as repeating it, so much as regaining it, making up for lost time, retrieving what he felt should have been his.""The Great Gatsby"" is not so much about repetition, as it is about retrieval; not so much a remembrance of things past, as a resumption of a journey from a point in the past when the journey was broken.Carey Mulligan as Daisy (Courtesy: The Telegraph)The Pursuit of Another Man's WifeAt its heart, Gatsby engages in adultery with Daisy, with a view to convincing her to divorce Tom and marry him.Many might find his conduct objectionable, except that he is young, elegant, good-looking, fabulously wealthy and, most importantly, in love with the slender Daisy.In contrast, Tom is a brute of a man, he is an ex-champion footballer, hard and cruel. Most importantly, he has cheated on Daisy many times and now has a mistress, the stout, but sensuous, Myrtle Wilson.Tom comes from an extremely wealthy mid-western family. Money is no object to him. Daisy might have the voice of money, but Tom has the demeanour and arrogance of not just money, but old money.When Tom learns of Daisy's infidelity and Gatsby's takeover bid, he goes into typical capitalist mode in order to defend his wife, his asset, his marital property.He researches Gatsby's past and theorises about how he has made his new money. He plans his counter-attack.The narrator, Nick Carraway, watches on, not just witness to a battle between Good and Evil, but in reality a battle between two degrees of bad.Black and white portrait of Isla Fisher as Myrtle WilsonTom's Defence StrategyIn the realm of love, as between two rival men, there can be no such thing as a friendly takeover bid.There is no suggestion that Tom can allow Gatsby to have Daisy, so that he can settle for Myrtle. The latter is just a plaything, something he spends time on, because she is available and he can have her without effort. All Myrtle ever wanted from her own husband was a gentleman with breeding. He turns out to be a mere mechanic and car salesman. He doesn't have the right status. Equally, although he is content to have her as his mistress, Tom doesn't see Myrtle as having the right status for marriage either.Ultimately, the role of marriage is not to perpetuate love and happiness. Tom's task is to bond together two wealthy establishment families and their riches. A merger of two capitalist families moves them that much closer to monopolistic power, in the same way that the intermarriage of royal families once cemented international power.Tom's goal is so important that it can accommodate his cruelty and infidelities, at least in his eyes.Moreover, it allows Tom to prevail over Gatsby, who, despite his war record, his partly-completed Oxford education, his wealth, his glamour, and his apparent achievement of the Great American Dream, is not ""one of us"".Ultimately, coincidence, accident and fate intervene on behalf of Tom, almost comically if it was not so sad, and he resists Gatsby's takeover bid.Nick, the observer, the witness, the audience of this tragedy, is left disgusted.Elizabeth Debicki as Jordan BakerThe Great American Paradox""The Great Gatsby"" is a short novel. At times, there is more telling than showing. At times, the description is too adjectival or adverbial for the dictates of current style manuals.Take away the mansion, the parties and the glamour, and what remains comes close to the dimensions of film noir like ""Double Indemnity"".While the novel is perceived as hailing the Great American Dream, the paradox is that it highlights how great are the forces that are lined up to resist the efforts of a man who aspires to the Dream, especially if that man is a trespasser who covets another man's wife, even if he loves her and she loves him.There are flaws in Fitzgerald's writing, but they are tolerable. The story is magificent, even if, when laid out methodically, it might appear cliched. The characters, while realistic, are detailed and larger than life, certainly detailed enough to withstand the scrutiny when they are projected onto the silver screen. They are portrayed acting out their emotions in exactly the same way that we might in the same circumstances.However, in the long run, what makes ""The Great Gatsby"" great is Fitzgerald's ability to both adulate and perpetuate the Great American Dream, while simultaneously subverting it."
990,Sarah Yeung,The most spectacularly sad book I have ever read.
991,Stephenee Foster,I liked this school book... I liked it a lot... It's one of my favorite classics... And I ugh! Im yup I really enjoyed this 
992,Amy Stilgenbauer,"I argue a lot with my friends about my extreme love for this book. No, I don't relate to the characters in any way and no, I don't find any of them admirable or even relatively good people. In fact, I find them frustrating, shallow, and in desperate need of a good dose of reality. I don't think this is a failing. I think this is what attracts me to this book. There is something about the way Fitzgerald captured a turning point in society. The underlying cynicism of the book is what does resonant with me. It's looking into a world that is suffering severe decadence and saying ""No, sorry, sometimes you can't get what you want and you're just going to have to get over it.""It is a chilly book in tone and it's hard to get emotionally attached to, but again, I don't feel that's a failing. I feel like some context about the modernist movement and the world in general in which these authors were writing helps. World War I is not talked about very often (at least in the history classes I had during my years in American schools). It tends to get skipped over, but the reality is, the world was -reeling-. A lot of great art and literature from that time is bitter, cynical, absurd, isolationist (especially American works) and basically a desperate attempt to make sense of what just happened. All of society was trying to do this as well. It led to a lot of self indulgence in popular culture and that is the world that Gatsby represents.[Disclaimer: I've never been very good at taking ""New Critical"" approaches and removing context.]I think that the Great Gatsby is a perfect slice of society novel. It shines a light on a particular aspect of Jazz Age culture, forces it in front of a mirror and says ""Look at yourself!"" The self indulgence of the characters mirrors our own society in ways that I don't think we realize and I think it's something that we need to be called on occasionally.I understand that this opinion will always be contentious and that's all right, but for me at least The Great Gatsby will always hold a special place in the ""books that affected my life"" part of my heart."
993,Lauren Page,"The Great GatsbyReviewed by: Lauren PageThe book The Great Gatsby is absolutely great! I strongly recommend this book to anyone. This book in complied of stressful situations along with exciting parties at Jay Gatsby's mansion in West Egg. I believe that anyone could get into this book because of the many situations that pop up as you continue reading. As you begin reading The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald you are introduced to the main character and narrator Nick. After you are introduced to Nick, you meet the rest of the characters. Tom, Daisy, Jordan, and of course Jay Gatsby. Once Nick is moved into his home on West Egg he is invited to one of Gatsby’s parties. One of the few who are actually invited by the host himself. Once you get deeper into the book you learn that Jay and Daisy had once been romantically involved with each other. But that was before World War 1 started. Some of my favorite parts of this book are when Gatsby and Daisy are reunited and when they have tea for the first time in almost 5 years at Nick’s house. I believe that most people could relate to the extreme awkwardness that takes place during that meeting. I also loved that you can put yourself in the character’s shoes. You can more than likely relate to how Gatsby feels about Daisy and the love he feels for her. This book captures your mind and heart and this is how any good book should be. "
994,Lisa (Harmonybites),"I think the biggest surprise about The Great Gatsby was what a pleasure it was to read; not what you expect of the ""great"" classics you are happy to not be required to read with your school days finished. It's fast paced, not long for a novel, with completely natural dialogue. The prose is gorgeous and memorable and leaves you with an indelible impression of the Jazz Age.It has a reputation as a romantic book, or as a romance I don't think is justified. Daisy Buchanan and Jay Gatsby come across to me as too shallow for me to believe in the sincerity or deepness of their affections. But then I think that's part of what the book is about: surface versus reality and flash versus substance. Daisy is more an ideal of romance Gatsby flirts with and Gatsby himself all shining facade.Americans like to think of themselves as ""self-made"" and if The Great Gatsby is thought of as a great American novel I think it's partly because in the figure of Gatsby you get the fake side of that--not someone who sheds past or tradition to become a truer self but to hide their real self--and because he can't it comes crashing down.But the book itself isn't shallow or just surface shine but the kind you find more that strikes you on rereads. I think that might be part of why it's Nick Carraway that carries the narrative, not Gatsby. You need an observer deeper and sharper than Gatsby and the observer perspective allows Gatsby to be introduced (a good 54 pages into the book in my edition"
995,Micha Blum, I'm just speechless.Best book I read the entire year.
996,Luke Mino,"The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a classic fiction book, set in the fictional town of West Egg, New York, in 1922. A major theme that can be seen in novel is that wealth does not always provide happiness. In The Great Gatsby, Jay Gatsby is a wealthy, mysterious man, who is known throughout West Egg due to misconceptions about his past life and rise to fame, brought on by unknowing people, and for the outrageous parties that are often thrown at his mansion. Although Jay may have a seemingly perfect life, his happiness is found through the love of his life, Daisy Buchanan, who Jay relentlessly pursues. An issue that the book suggests is that even having all the riches that one could desire, happiness may still not be found, and once it is found, one should try their hardest to keep it. The Great Gatsby won’t soon be forgotten, due to it’s dramatic and descriptive scenes, that can make the reader feel as if it is a part of the book. The Great Gatsby rightfully deserves it’s title as a classic."
997,Ayne Ray,"This defining American novel, set against the background of the decadence of the Jazz Age, is a superb examination of the betrayal of the American Dream, demonstrating the folly of falling in love with wealth and idolizing luxury, and thereby illustrating the absent moral center and hypocrisy of the era."
998,Laura Ali,"This was suppose to be a high school literature read for me, 10 years later I pick it up and finished it in one day-really good read! Jay Gatsby is so mysterious and you long to know ever detail of his life while speculation is thrown around you still wonder. Fitzgerald draws in his readers with his colorful descriptions and as a NY'er you can really imagine the tone if the city and LI in the 1920s. Now I can watch the movie."
999,Nightshade,"At the end of this book, starting with chapter 7, all heck breaks loose! It's CRAZY!"
1000,Caroline Mcneil,"The year's 1922, in West Egg VIllage, Long Island, New York. Nick Carraway, a young business man, was different than his neighbors in West Egg. There was a man by the name of Gatsby, Jay Gatsby. Gatsby was an extremely wealthy man who threw extravagant parties in his mansion every Saturday night. Half the people who came either weren't invited or didn't know Gatsby whatsoever. One night, Nick drove out to have dinner with his cousin, Daisy and her husband Tom Buchanan in East Egg. Her house mirrored Gatsby house over the sound. While at dinner, Nick is introduced to Jordan Baker and they later form a relationship. Jordan tells him about Tom's secret affair with a woman, Myrtle Wilson. Later on in the story, Nick receives an invitation to one of Gatsby's legendary parties. At the party he chats with a young man who just so happens to be the host himself. He also meets Jordan and she tells him a little bit about Gatsby. He and Daisy were 'childhood sweethearts' and he bought her house and the reason he threw these parties was that he hoped that Daisy would wander into the parties and impress her. Gatsby gets wind of the news that Nick is cousins with Daisy and asks him to invite Daisy over for tea, so that he could see her. She accepts the invitation and the two awkwardly rekindle their love. Tom knows something is up with his wife now that she is spending more and more time with Gatsby. He invites Jordan, Nick, and Mr. Gatsby for lunch at his house, then later head into the city. Things grow awkward and result in a heated argument between Jay and Tom. Tom tells Gatsby that Daisy would never love him because she already loves him (Tom) and Gatsby's money was from bootlegging and illegal business. Gatsby responds saying that Daisy and him were deeply in love and after all the years, she is still in love with him. The men continue to argue who Daisy loves more. Daisy is persistent of leaving, so Tom sends her off with Gatsby to drive back to East Egg. Tom, Nick, and Jordan drive back to East Egg after the two left and passed by George Wilson's garage. Myrtle's husband was a mechanic; as they drove pass, they saw a crowd so they investigated. There was a murder; Myrtle was hit by an oncoming car and killed instantly. Wilson is devastated and shocked. Tom has a word with him before the group leaves and obviously he is upset and distraught that his lover was dead. They arrive at the Buchanan's house and Tom calls a taxi for Nick. As Nick is waiting for his taxi in front of the gate, he encounters Gatsby who was lurking in the bushes whom was keeping a watchful eye out for his sweetheart just in case Tom tried anything. He explains that it was his car that hit Myrtle, but Daisy was driving. She was still shaken up from the lunch and apparently wasn't well enough to drive, but Gatsby tells Nick that he will full blame for her. The next day, George starts to go 'mad' after figuring out from Tom that it was Gatsby's car that struck Myrtle. He is enraged and jumps to the conclusion that it was Gatsby who was having an affair with his wife. He goes to Gatsby's mansion and finds him swimming in his pool. George shoots Gatsby killing him, then shoots himself. The story ends by Nick arranging a funeral for Jay Gatsby. He tries to ring for some of Gatsby's friends, most of which declined at the invitation except for Mr. Gatz (Gatsby's father). The only people at the funeral was Mr. Carraway, Mr. Gatz, and some of Gatsby's servants. After this episode, he ends his relationship with Jordan and moves back West to escape the life of Mr. Gatsby. Nick never got ahold of Daisy to tell her that Gatsby was dead and reflects that Gatsby was truly 'great' because he turned his dreams into reality. I personally loved reading this book. I found myself attached to this book and the characters. It was written with big words that I honestly had no clue what they meant and I had to reread many sentences over and over to try to understand the context. Overall, I give this book a 5 out of 5 because it was truly great. "
1001,Saya,"This novel, The Great Gatsby by Scott Fitzgerald, is one of my most favorite books in the whole world and I am very glad that my English teacher allowed me to write a review of this book, as my English “essay”. I read this book for the first time when I was in fifth grade, and this would be more than 10th time rereading this book. But actually when I first read it, I hardly understood the story since it was too complicated. Still I like the story plot, since then, bug I was deeply impressed the second time I read it when I was in middle school.First of all, I really liked this book because of its mysterious themes and how things are written so beautifully. Some parts are even mysterious to the end since some parts of the books is written by the bias of Nick Carraway, the narrator. I was amazed by how things are greatly written, yet short in length, since most books that are said to be great are long. The story itself is simple, but has many symbolisms, and catches the readers’ attentions. The symbolisms that I thought that was interesting the most were the colors. Each of the colors that have been emphasized has meanings to it. Out of all the colors which comes out in the story, green must be the most important symbol, it represents hope and wealth. In the first chapter, at Gatsby’s first appearance in the book, “ he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward- and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock.” He was reaching out for hope about his eternal lover, Daisy, in the beginning of the book, which also comes out in the end of the book. Gatsby has “believed in the green light.”At first, the movement of the story is rather slow as in many of the other books, but when I reached the point where the story plot started to build conflicts in the story; it soon attracted me to read without even stopping. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is desperate to read a great novel; The Great Gatsby sure is one of the greatest books of American Literature. It is entertaining, intriguing, and is a masterpiece.I would rate this book with five stars out of five, which is very rare for me to do since I usually have some parts that I dislike about the book even if I do like the book itself, because of its gorgeous way of expressing the story. What I liked the most of this book was its use of the narrator, Nick Carraway. Nick was explaining to us, the readers, from his own perspective as a first person point of view, which made it interesting for the readers since as Nick finds out something, at the same time, we get to know his discoveries. Not Nick retelling the story. There weren’t any part which I did not like in this book since this was so perfectly written. I think that most of the people who read this book will like this, and I would like to recommend this book, for people to read, once in their lifetime. "
1002,Rogi,F. Scott Fitzgerald is one elegant writer.
1003,Harry Dunkerley,"Fitzgerald maps out the sprawl of wealth, exuberance and amorality of the Jazz Age in perhaps some of the most succinctly elegant prose I have ever come across, effortlessly transitioning between conversational and abstract tones with a real poetic clarity.Nick's somewhat reserved personality does seem to either be interpreted as dull and lifeless, or as almost a transparent window for us to glimpse into the lives of these shallow characters without bias. He sort of becomes a spectator as they idly prance between lovers, seeking love, or status, or some warped amalgamation of the two that rises out of their hedonistic lifestyles to form a thin facade over something more empty and vapid than they could imagine. I'm undecided about how I feel towards his character, but considering the rest of the book I'm happy to set that aside.Gatsby’s single-minded ambition, pursued in all its garish opulence, altered by every whim of his beloved, and largely uninterrupted by Nick’s hesitant character is what destroyed him in the end, as a man rising into circles he was never a part of, and never truly could be. It seems that for all his passion and courage he too was taken in by the shining surface of promised love, riches; yearning for an American Dream that for him was unattainable.Definitely five stars. How could I not? "
1004,Tempo de Ler,"O Grande Gatsby é muito mais do que aparenta de início e é também prova de que, com relativamente poucas palavras, é possível contar uma história absolutamente formidável... Não me refiro ao óbvio romance mas sim a tudo o que está por detrás do mesmo.F. Scott Fitzgerald pintou um magnífico quadro do início do século XX ao descrever uma atmosfera urbana moderna marcada pela especulação financeira, pela inovação tecnológica, pela corrupção e pelo consumismo extremo. A descrição de uma sociedade supérflua apostada na aplicação narcisista da sua riqueza, na exibição de liberdade e na frenética busca pela felicidade é soberba deixando ainda espaço para a demonstração da diferença entre classes sociais associadas também ao complexo racial. Senti-me completamente transportada para este mundo vibrante - Fitzgerald fez com que a electricidade e a proliferação dos carros e dos telefones parecesse realmente uma novidade também para mim.…E num mundo de tanta realização industrial é também possível «criar» pessoas: e foi isso mesmo o que Gatsby fez com ele próprio! De origem humilde, Gatsby força a sua entrada numa sociedade à qual não pertence tornando-se para os que o rodeiam num homem misterioso sobre o qual são espalhados os mais variados rumores. Mas Gatsby personifica o que é estar só no meio de uma multidão: apesar das festas badaladas e de ter a casa constantemente cheia, nunca ninguém se aproximou o suficiente para o conhecer realmente, ninguém sabe da sua devoção e dedicação a uma única mulher - Daisy. Assim, ao enganar os outros, Gatsby engana-se a si próprio, correndo atrás de um sonho que já passou do prazo, perseguindo o seu verdadeiro amor enquanto vive uma mentira vazia. É através de Nick que vamos conhecendo, pouco a pouco, Gatbsy. Nick Carraway pode parecer na maioria das vezes a única pessoa sóbria no meio desta agitação, mas é também ele produto da sociedade em que se inclui e a qual nos permite analisar através das suas observações. É também através dele que presenciamos o desenvolvimento do romance entre Daisy e Gatbsy; aqui, até o amor é marcado pela superficialidade e associado ao consumismo, ao desejo arrebatado de possuir. O amor de Daisy por Gatbsy é reflexo da riqueza que ele possui e exemplo disso é a sua resposta ao arrebatamento romântico de Gatsby… um simples e oco comentário à sua aparência requintada. E claro, sendo a ""sentimentalóide"" que sou, foi o final que me arrebatou. A decepcionante sensação de não ver um sonho realizado, de perceber que este não era sequer realizável - Daisy não passava de uma ilusão à qual Gatsby teimou em se agarrar em todos os seus anos de solidão, uma mulher que sendo estupidamente inocente ou inocentemente estúpida nunca poderia compreender Gatsby nem corresponder aos seus sentimentos. Ainda assim, Jay Gatbsy persegue o seu sonho com o máximo carinho e dedicação, até à tragédia. Claro que por detrás de um grande romance está obrigatoriamente um grande escritor. A narrativa é belíssima, poética e pomposa mantendo-se, ainda assim, fluída e descomplicada. O Grande Gatsby é mesmo um Grande livro."
1005,helen the bookowl,"The first time I started reading this, I read about 50 pages and wasn't much into the story - so I quit it. I recently decided to pick it up again, and this time I was blown away! This is a beautiful story that I think depicts the Jazz Age perfectly, and it contains some amazing themes such as love, popularity, friendship and how a person can impact you for life. I loved it, and I especially loved how F. Scott Fitzgerald weaves every detail together beautifully. There are no loose ends and you can't help but smile once you finish reading the last page. One of the things that appealed to me the most about this story was how it was told in reverse. You know that the narrator looks back on the things happening, and it leaves you with a tense feeling because you know something big and dramatic is going to happen. I also love how this story comes with its share of surprises, and I especially love how it captures the mood of the Jazz Age. Even though I didn't live during that time, I clearly felt the ambiance of that era through the pages. After finishing this book, I immediately ordered a new book by F. Scott Fitzgerald: ""Tender Is the Night"" - simply because I needed more! I'm excited to see if I'll like that one as much as ""The Great Gatsby"", because if I do, I might have found a new favourite classic author of mine. "
1006,Stephanie Suarez,"What can I say about this book, I was just amazed very page Was a new adventure a new drama This books is about how the American dream decline, the difference between social classes , and the pass dreaming for the future. For me the love between Daisy and Gatsby it was a mystery twisted love, actually a sick love. We can see how gatsby became everything he propose to become just to be close and win his ""true love"" and in the other hand Daisy dosent even care for him just the money but that not even enought because at the end she choices what is already secure. Gatsby had hope that he and Daisy would end up together, the green light on Daisy dock symbolize that. But here is when we all ask what when wrong ? Gatsby had it all why Daisy didn't end up with him did Gatby accomplish his dream? That make him the failure? I asked myself this question and what I can conclude about this is the he fail because he was still living in the past. He try so hard to make something that it was never going to happen, he wanted to bring the past to the future , this is why he fail you would never get what you want and the way you want it. And as every American novel we already know how gatsby is going end up. With a failure dream , no hope and alone his destiny was set for him to be gone. And that how this story end he become successful and rich to try re live the past with his true love Daysi. Got His money from dealer, and try to make something out of him that wasent true to win Daisy, she never love him, all she ever loved was the money do from the beginning we knew they worent meant to be together. Daisy end up not getting with him , Gatsby lost his hope and daisy and die."
1007,Jorge,"The Great Gatsby is F. Scott. Fitzgerald's masterpiece for it is only less than 200 pages long and is still one of the american classics. The book acomplihses this through a masterful use of language and symbolism. Some symbols found in The Great Gatsby are the extensive use of gold in the novel that signifies wealth and how tragic a life of wealth can be. For the book is about the American Dream and about it's flaws for the dream of success can lead to failure in many ways. Fitzgerald shows how the dream can destroy a good person such as Gatsby chasing after Daisy a woman that is careless and cold such as a broken dream, for Gatsby just dreamt the wrong dream."
1008,Hennessy,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is an amazing, amazing book truly a great piece of american literature. “His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips’ touch she blossomed like a flower and the incarnation was complete.” This is one of my favorite quote because the great Gatsby is a love story the way Gatsby looked at daisy was the way every girl wanted to be looked at. This book is very good not only does Fitzgerald capture the good and happiness but he also captures the tragedy and drama. The book takes place in NY West Egg district of Long Island, a wealthy area. The main character is Gatsby and he stays enigma to his next door neighbor Nick but eventually invites him to one of his extraordinarily large parties. Gatsby threw parties every weekend everyone from everywhere went their but no one really knew what Gatsby looked like. After a while nick and Gatsby become very close and the whole reason Gatsby threw all those parties was in the hopes that daisy would one day show up. Daisy did in fact show up with her husband one day & I suppose you can say they had a secret love affair. The Great Gatsby is full of themes and lessons to be learned like love, wealth, lies, deceit, passion, forgiveness and much more. Overall I gave this book 5 stars because I loved it I would definitely recommend it. The Great Gatsby book has the right amount of love and drama to keep the reader interested and always wondering what's going to happen the next. I think it's a book that effects emotions, it can be confusing and sad but overall its amazing and still deserves 5 stars. "
1009,Josh Ang,"One of the most famous novels to come out of the Jazz Age, The Great Gatsby is a tragedy of a man whose pursuit of the elusive American Dream leads to his destruction.Gatsby, as seen through the eyes of Nick Carraway, is a larger-than-life self-made man with a dubious background, whose opulent parties at the brightest-lit mansion on West Egg precedes even the man himself, and who looked the part of “an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd.” In this fleeting impression Nick has of Gatsby at their first meeting, there is a sense of a buried identity under the artifice that is not quite successfully kept from view.Gatsby is obsessed with Daisy, Nick’s married cousin, who becomes more a symbol of what he wants to possess, but which ironically loses its significance when it is within reach. The novel is complicated by Nick’s narrative, which is never reliable, and like Gatsby’s identity, never quite stops shifting, and oftentimes displaces the focus on Gatsby to become more revealing about Nick. That we never get a true picture of Gatsby or Gatz, is perhaps the strength of the novel as a modernist text, in the way it sets questions about identity and the construction of it in place. "
1010,Daniel,"I believed in the green light, the orgastic book that year by year recedes before us. By the time I read The Great Gatsby for the third time, I had come to believe it was the best and most beautiful book in the world. I last read it ten years ago. I remember that last reading. I had been doing some unpaid overtime to meet a deadline, doing the most drearily robotic work imaginable, one weekend in June 2004, in a workplace far away from everywhere. Afterwards I walked a few kilometres to a bus stop where I thought a bus might come in the next hour or two, a bus stop amid tall pine trees, situated on a thin strip of gravel that was not quite footpath and not quite road, where every moment I imagined one of the automobiles shooting past might waver momentarily, might mistake this strip of gravel for part of the road, as must be easy to do, and extinguish me. I pulled Gatsby out of my backpack and stood there in the middle of nowhere and plunged again into a richly lived and remembered and written life in the fast set in New York in the 1920s. I remember so vividly the reading of it, and know so well that I loved it, that a few weeks ago it seemed strange that I had forgotten so much of the book itself. I noticed it when I watched the Baz Luhrmann movie. I kept thinking 'What? Why would they add that?' and then looking it up in the book and seeing that it was in there after all. That's when I knew I needed to bump it up my reading pile - if I'd forgotten so much, I was long overdue for a re-read.I think a lot of the reason I'd forgotten things that happened in it is that Gatsby is more about ideas and emotions and impressions and beautiful sentences, than about the things that happen in it. The people, apart from Gatsby and Nick, are ghosts. And Gatsby himself is an idea as much as a character. Maybe several ideas:a) A person is a fictitious character that a 'more real' version of the person invents and acts out. The character we perform is not only performed for other people, but also for ourselves. This is illustrated by showing us an extreme example in Gatsby, where the 'more real' man and the creation have different names and look and act and speak differently.b) It is more satisfying to believe in the unattainable 'green light', than to achieve some real-life goal. The green light is only an idea, so it can be perfect; real things must always be imperfect. But I always believed in Gatsby as a character, as someone who might exist and who would be admirable and likeable if he did.During those years between reads, Gatsby had become a kind of green light to me, a perfect book deep within my to-read pile (a pile that currently fills several rooms), waiting to be enjoyed again when the time was right. The actual reading was necessarily a disappointment. It turns out there are lots of sentences that are not beautiful, but merely deliver information in a matter-of-fact way. In my recollection it had turned into a prose poem, all green lights and blue lawns and valleys of ashes and Eckleburg's eyes. It was surprising to find that a lot of it is just stuff happening. Interesting and enjoyable stuff, yes, but not the stuff that dreams are made of.I think it says something about how great Gatsby is that it ferments in the memory to become something greater than the words in it. This does not happen with many books.I wonder how long it will be before it stops being a real book and becomes a green light again? And when that happens should I read it again, a great book but not nearly so great as my recollection of it, or hang on to the green light? If I could catch that green light version of the book, and write it down as I remember it, that would be something."
1011,Destiny Walker,"The book I read was The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The genre of this book is a fiction. The theme of this book is, "" There are many obstacles to achieving the American Dream"". The main characters are Jay Gatsby, Nick Carraway, Daisy, Tom ( Daisy's husband), Jordan Baker, Myrtle Wilson, Mr. Gatz, Meyer Wolfsheim, and George B. Wilson. The setting takes place in 1922, Long Island, the fictional town of West Egg. Nick Carraway moves to the West Egg in search of the American Dream. He becomes neighbors with a millionaire named Jay Gatsby. Nick becomes captivated in the world of wealth, affairs, and murder. "
1012,Abigail Clark-Morgan,"Well, somehow I have never read this classic and when it was ready for collection from the library I immediately delved in. I have literally just closed the cover and feel a huge reminder of how fickle most people are and how few true friends you really have. It is not until adversity strikes, that those really there for you are revealed. Poor Gatsby! Basically all he ever did was love someone unavailable to him and then spend his life living in that past recollection of happiness without care, trying to find her and bring back that feeling. Was it that lack of care that allowed him to bootleg a lifestyle to support the fantasy he cared so much for? This book has quite an Oscar Wilde feel to it - the societal confusion, one-liners and tragedy. Unfortunately, events did not end happily with all loose ends well tied. Perhaps I'm more of a romantic than I thought, but I don't think Gatsby got what he deserved. Yes he was a crook and that's bad, but his intentions were honourable and I felt Daisy's revelation of, albeit briefly, loving her husband as well as Gatsby was his ultimate crushing moment.I enjoyed this, the pages almost turned themselves and the story unfurled from between the almost falling out pages and inky typeface of my well-read library copy of this Penguin classic."
1013,Lila,"The Great Gatsby is a complex story about a man whose dedication to a dream of a girl leads him to his downfall. Small enough to read in one sitting, but requiring multiple readings to understand, it's one of the most skillfully crafted novels I've ever read. Fitzgerald is a master of prose, able to create entire scenes with language still fresh today, and whose keen eye focuses on the nuances of our flawed desires even from a peripheral point of view. Nick Carroway and of course Gatsby himself, are characters so memorable and defined that identification with either is impossible to avoid. Who hasn't had a friend doomed to his love, whose personality and ambitions bubble over reality? And who hasn't been gripped by that innocent, fiery passion for a girl or a boy in their youth, refusing to let it go? Unlike Gatsby, the novel matures over the course of the years in your life, and I read it every few years or so to weigh in my mind and heart the choice to stay true to my warm ideals or submit to cold reality."
1014,Emma Mason,"The Great Gatsby is a classic literature go-to for avid descriptions of the ""Golden Age"" of the 1920's. However, it is not popular because of its idealization of the good qualities of the 1920's, but for the insights it offers into the deeper darker corners of man's mind at the time. It provides fleeting glimpses into turbulent romances, including the main affair of Gatsby and Daisy, whom Gatsby met a long time ago. Fitzgerald's poetic writing style provides confusing at some moments in which the meaning is lost in the jumble of words, but it otherwise proves an effective writing means throughout the book as it adds in necessary details to the plot. Fitzgerald's main goal appears to be to provide a unique take on an age reveled for prosperity in many ways, especially including women's rights as they became more independent. Gatsby's character is an odd one in the sea of ideal partying socialites, eager to quickly grasp onto tendrils of any type of excitement, including alcohol, they find. Gatsby, however, is a down to earth, focused man whose one goal is to pursue a women who has already been claimed by another. However this woman, Daisy, easily leaps into this affair with him, proving just how rash people were when it came to decision making. The ending of the book is beautiful in its simplicity, demonstrating that there were many more ideas Gatsby could have pursued, but he died eternalizing the green light. The Great Gatsby, therefore, is a great book for all ages to read as it is a literary milestone, and it also provides beautiful sentients as well. A five out of five rating."
1015,Nicholas XP,"This was my first book I have ever read a while back when I took up reading as a leisure activity. My older self wasn't acquainted with the vast vocabulary and profound comprehension skills I now possess. In fact, I didn't retain anything from the then convoluted book and was perplexed by every chapter. Fast forward a year later, after my enlightenment, I see the beauty of Fitzgerald's writing and his distinctive style. He presents a story with impeccable details and characters that are so static that they are surprisingly interesting. Most authors cannot have static characters for they fear they will born the audience with their banality. However, Fitzgerald presented his characters with the utmost perfection. Daisy was a quasi-worldly lady who from conception was beleaguered by wealth which makes her narrow minded and blind to the common vicissitudes of life. Gatsby was entrapped by the idea of attaining great wealth that from an early age he had looked at himself as already rich. His unwavering love for Daisy is unique; he knew as soon as he kissed her his lust and desires for other woman would be gone in an instant and forever. He was possessed by a perpetual trance that made him see the world and its events differently than if he looked at them objectively. The time period in the story is the 1920s, a time when sex was rampant and people revered materialism. The stock market was good and bootlegging made for some of the newly rich. He showed how people only cared about tangible items and lavish parties and much less for people and their feelings. There was cheating from Tom and others, and when Gatsby died, nobody showed up to his funeral. Although this is a fictitious story, I do admire Gatsby's drive to escape poverty and to remake himself through his own efforts. He was on his own, there were no handouts. From a young age he started on a perpetual quest to better himself in elegance, intelligence and overall knowledge. He was not one to waste time. What really made this story was the vivid imagery that was used constantly in different ways. For instance, I felt as if I was there, standing next to Gatsby as he watched the green light blink across the bay. I felt his strong desire and emotion to get what he wanted; he was determined and reserved. A great story. "
1016,Zach,"I am rereading or (rather listening to) the Great Gatsby as it is part of the ""Big Read"" here in DC. The great thing about rereading a novel is that you can mentally skip over the plot and pick up on other subtitlties. Humor: The book has some funny moments: -Nick describing a man sent over by Gatsby to mow his law...in the rain. -Description of an auto accident at the first party--the driver appearing confused that the wheel has come off and that the car cannot make it to a gas station --Tom about Gatsby--I've made an inquiry--Jordan's response ""You are consulting a medium?""--It's probably funnier in context. Time in US History: In the novel we see a generation that appears not that far from the present (20th Century America full of cars, big business, NYC is a major metropolitan center with skyscrapers, subways etc) but the novel also makes reference to the US Civil War and how the characters' families were directly impacted by it, the way people today may talk about WWII--this illustrates the major shifts that were happening in the US at this time. Gatsby's Obsession with Past with Daisy he is so enamored with the past or what he thinks was the past at the same time he is attempting to reinvent himself to avoid his own past. Gatsby demanding Daisy say she never loved TomSubtle Hints/Touches--Wedding going on in ballroom beneath hotel suite as Daisy/Tom/Gatsby have confrontation--Description of Tom as once impressive athlete--with only decline to look forward to now. "
1017,Gloria Huang,"I think the Great Gatsby is a great book for those who enjoy romance genres and books setting in the jazz era. This book focuses on Jay Gatsby and his love and obsession with a former lover named Daisy Buchanan. Jay Gatsby is a millionaire who holds a huge party at his mansion every weekend. Those who attend don't have any invitations and no one has ever seen the mysterious Gatsby himself. It is revealed later that the real reason why Gatsby holds those parties is because he hope that one day, Daisy would wander into the party and they would be reunited once again. I think one of the theme in this book is that love is so powerful that you would do anything for the people you love. I really loved this book and also the movie. So if you have already watched and liked the movie, you would surely enjoy reading this book as much as I did."
1018,Anaatasiia Shevchuk,"I believe any girl would want a man to love her as Gatsby loved Daisy. Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning-- So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."
1019,TL," I loved this book! And that's saying a lot, since my enjoyment of classics usually doesn't go past ""mildly entertaining"". The Great Gatsby is beautifully written and very REAL. Jay Gatsby himself is the perfect example of ""fake it till you make it"". He buys all of this luxurious stuff just so he can impress Daisy Buchanan, the love of his life (who is married to another man). His character is desperate, tragic, and has a far-fetched dream that he has been holding on to for five years. Daisy and Tom Buchanan are vapid and shallow. I particularly disliked them because, as it was stated in the book, they were careless people. They didn't care much about the world, their daughter, or each other. Nick Caraway, the narrator, was probably my favorite character, despite his constant worshipping of Gatsby. He was a good friend and didn't show off his wealth like Gatsby and the Buchanans.  The story itself is about trying to recreate a beautiful past. I won't give anything away, so I recommend everyone to read this book.  The Great Gatsby's powerful end will stay with me for the rest of my life.  5 stars."
1020,Emily B,"""I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life""The first time I read this, last summer, I neither understood it nor enjoyed it. The characters seemed utterly self-absorbed and confusing and I wondered how anyone could possibly call it the greatest American novel of all time. Daisy seemed like a fluffy bimbo and Gatsby a desperate fool, with Nick being the helplessly annoying bystander to all their sordid affairs.In contrast, upon finishing my second reading, I found myself feeling stunned and bereft. The shallowness and hollowness which I perceived last time is exactly what Fitzgerald was aiming for, and I have finally 'got it'. I was tempted to feel absolutely nothing for the this morally deprived cast, and yet there are undercurrents of something so depressing throughout the novel, especially in the last chapter, which lingers on and forces me to feel a cocktail of uncertain emotions. Claustrophobic, dazzling and very relevant in today's wealth obsessed society. I am looking forward to the film adaptation."
1021,Nolan,"Loved this book, I need to reread and annotate the good passages...“So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.” “And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.” “There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.” No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.” ""Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,"" he told me, ""just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.” “His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips’ touch she blossomed like a flower and the incarnation was complete.” “Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.” "
1022,Kaleb Hanion, The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a book set in the roaring 20's with main narrator Nick Carraway. Nick moved to New York to join the bond business. His cousin Daisy Buchanan lived right across the bay with her husband Tom who which Nick went to Yale with. Nick soon finds out that his neighbor Jay Gatsby is a notorious party host. Gatsby throws massive and elegant parties every weekend. Nick soon becomes very well acquainted with Gatsby and learns that he is obsessed with his cousin Daisy. Gatsby and Daisy used to be madly in love until Gatsby went off to serve in World War I. Since then everything Gatsby has done has been for Daisy including the parties. Nick plays a role and reuniting the two. Conflict soon arises between Tom and Gatsby. Daisy ultimately has to choose between her husband and her long lost love. The Great Gatsby is a work of art in story telling and sentences are written so satisfyingly well. Fitzgerald does a great job of introducing ambiguity to the story that leaves you thinking about the book even when you aren't reading it. Also the book really illustrates the essence of America in the roaring 20's. The story is so incredibly written and I would recommend this book to anyone who appreciates great writing.
1023,Winston,"I can't help but simplify book themes to try to find some basic truth. However, to echo John Green, the truth resists simplicity. That being said, I found both the longing for a future and the past to be a central theme.I'm going to spend a bit of time just thinking it over. But I loved it. I loved Gatsby complete devotion to achieving his dream, regardless how fantastic and unreal it was. “He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his heart.” Gatsby is driven by for a love that he cannot have. It's unfair, mostly to him but Daisy also. Another line I really like that exemplifies their feelings for each other.""They had never been closer in their mouth of love nor communicated more profoundly with one another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder or when he touched the ends of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep.""And it wasn't meant to be, but Gatsby fights for it, stretching ever forward to get back to his true love. It's tragic that it didn't work. The world keeps turning, the bespectacled eyes of God keep watching, and everyone moves on. And sometimes, that's life for you.I don't know if Gatsby died because he lost his greatest love and couldn't bear moving on. I wonder if Daisy is happy. Or, if in the moments of her life that she gets a bit of peace; when her thoughts drift, she comes back to Gatsby.Anyway, lovely story. Great view point on idea of a apathetic God. "
1024,ellen,"This was one of my favorite books ever in high school. It was interesting to re-read it as an adult, because I found most of the characters so shallow and horrible. I think as a teenager, the party scenes, glamour of the era and drama enticed me. Now I was struck by how pathetic I found everyone, and what shallowness the era seemed to cause. Gatsby, making his fortune by mysterious means, focuses his life on winning back the heart of Daisy who has married Mr. Buchanan since they dated. This is such a faulty idea that Gatsby seems crazy and pathetic even while his party guests think of him as larger than life. Daisy is just a pretty and empty headed rich girl, so I did not understand why Gatsby would want her so badly. Of course that sad part of their doomed love is that Daisy's husband is repeatedly unfaithful and she may have been better with Gatsby after all. There is some wonder about how happy they would have been if Daisy and Gatsby had stayed together. Gatsby was nouveau riche,however he got his money, and Daisy's family would have disapproved. This mystery and tension around Gatsby and Daisy is the center of the novel, but the narrator Nick has a romance and a life in New York City, and Daisy's husband has an important role with his mistress. This book continues to enchant because of the glitter and partying atmosphere that surrounds the era. It is probably accurate that rich party animals were shallow and unsatisfied. The climax and ending is quite dramatic, and it is easy to see how this is such a classic."
1025,Valetta Teo,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is possibly one of the most beautiful books I’ve ever read. You can see its distinct beauty in its extremely lyrical writing. Fitzgerald’s writing makes you feel like you’re floating. It’s gentle and soothing and keeps you engaged. My favourite line in the book: “I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life."" This is the kind of book that you can read and fall in love with instantly.The Great Gatsby follows the character Nick Carraway, who moves to New York, and his neighbor is a guy named Jay Gatsby. And as it turns out, Gatsby moved there to chase the love of his life, which happens to be Nick’s cousin. Is a quite a short story, just hitting over 200 pages, but the book contains so much more than what the plot shows.The Great Gatsby is a book about the failure of the American dream, and it is set in the 1920s USA. It uses colours, and metaphors and juxtaposition to tell the story and it is a story of dreams, and the problems that come along with it.I’m sure all of you have heard of the saying “be careful what you wish for”, and The Great Gatsby will explore this in depth. No spoilers, but the characters in the book are all living the dream, yet none of them have a happy ending. To quote the book, “Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams”.The Great Gatsby shows you the people who live in riches, who have a carefree life and can basically do whatever they want, but it also shows you the danger of doing so. In the book we see how the characters live the life that so many of us wish for, but we get to see how it caused them to ruin their own lives and the lives of those who love them.Conveniently, The Great Gatsby is written from the point of view of Nick Carraway, who basically acts as a narrator and has not much significance in the book except being omnipresent. This is good for the book because it shows you the lives of the fortunate through a normal guy who got his wealth overnight and found his way into that strange and dramatic world. It makes the book more relatable, and easier to digest.The Great Gatsby is a book of love, of life, of care, of god, of wealth, of dreams and of death and it is definitely worth a read. Although, it might be a little dry to those who are not used to the writing style (but don't worry, it's a short book!)"
1026,WORDS N QUOTES,"WORDSNQUOTES Chances are that if you are over the age of eighteen, you have read, The Great Gastby. It is hard to ignore a classic with the perfect element of historical essence. Set in the 1920s, Long Island, New York, Fitzgerald depicts the transformation of the American dream from the focus on individualism and the pursuit of happiness into indulgence and corrupted dreams.Jay Gatsby, the main character is a walking, talking billboard of the American illusion. He is charismatic, wealthy, a war veteran, and most importantly he is in love. He is in love with Daisy Buchanan, the epitome of old aristrocracy and the shallowness achieved in 1920s America. Although Gatsby’s wealth is founded on criminal activities, his heart is pure. His devotion and love for Daisy are what lead him to his death. Daisy is the representation of women in Fitzgerald’s eyes. She is beautiful, alluring, wealthy, but also dangerous. Without a doubt, every character and place are a symbol supporting the broken dreams of the Jazz Age.The novel gives us a look into Fitzgerald’s psyche and real life. Nick Carraway, the narrator and the glue of the story, is the ghost of Fitzgerald’s mind. Like Nick, Fitzgerald’s popularity introduced him into a new seductive lifestyle and his conflicting feelings on the Jazz Age. It is worth revisiting or picking up for the first time. The Great Gatsby effortlessly brings life to the dichotomy between beauty and the hideous side of human nature. Facebook  | Instagram |  Twitter |  Pinterest  |  Society6"
1027,Pernille Tårnes,"Wow. Dette er en helt, helt fantastisk bok. Den er så utrolig velskrevet og helt forskrudd. Eller, den føles forskrudd. Handlingen i seg selv er ikke nødvendigvis så på kanten, men måten den er skrevet på gjør den så stor og fantastisk og rar. Mye mulig den har blitt en av mine favorittbøker, og det er helt klart en av de få bøkene jeg kommer til å lese igjen. Anbefaler den på det sterkeste hvis du vil ha en liten tur inn i en utrolig gøyal (språklig, i det minste) verden."
1028,Riya,"This is kind of a special review. You see, it's not often I review books out of the Young Adult genre, but after reading this classic gem, and then seeing the otherworldly movie, I just couldn't resist. Maybe it's because I read the book with Leo DiCaprio as Gatsby, or maybe it's the tragic love story that left me in a strange state of unshakeable giddiness and depression, but I loved The Great Gatsby, and encourage all of you who are planning to see the movie, to read the book first.The thing with classics is that even though they might not have many pages, they take much longer to read than a Young Adult novel. One cannot simply skip pages or skim over a section, because every single word, every sentence contains so much. With The Great Gatsby, I finished all 184 pages of it in no less than 4 days. Why, you ask? Because of all the damn, beautiful vocabulary! It's safe to say that my word bank has grown significantly after reading this. And that's not even the best part!Whereas I didn't end up enjoying Pride & Prejudice as much as I would have liked to, the opposite was true of The Great Gatsby. The parties, the affairs, the corruption at the core of a high-class American society composed of amusing, engrossing characters... I really don't think I've ever experienced anything quite like it! Fitzgerald transported me to a completely different, fantastic world, with characters whom I mostly hated, and captivating stories I was completely immersed in. Not once did I feel bored! This, coming from a 15-year-old teenager girl like myself seems pretty immense in my opinion. Read it, breathe it, live The Great Gatsby. And if you don't get it the first time, read it again. The Great Gatsby is one of those iconic, timeless novels that everyone should read, at least once in their lifetime. There are so many hidden messages and lessons behind this intricately, beautifully crafted novel that are still relevant today, and always will be."
1029,Jack Miller,"Holy cow, Jack read a book!I first read The Great Gatsby in my sophomore year of high school American Studies class. I must confess that, like so many books in my sophomore year American Studies class, I found it incredibly difficult to read, either due to my own distraction or disinterest, to the point where I would basically skim it and blatantly miss major plot points (example: did not realize Gatsby had died until it was referenced in a later chapter).This time, I found it a much easier (fun?) read. Gatsby has long been a favorite of my wife Courtenay who happens to be from Long Island so I always assumed she liked it because she found it to be relatable. So either a) I am a better reader now than when I was 15 (maybe...) or b) somehow the book hit closer to home. Now, as a guy from the midwest in his late 20s who spent a few years on the East Coast only to happily return I suppose I too found GG to be quite relatable.Even though the book seems to be regarded as a 1920s period piece I found the language, characters and situations to be pretty modern and fresh. All and all an enjoyable read and I am glad I picked it up again - I might try the same with some of the other books from sophomore year.Side note: I was interested in the ""car culture"" references in the book. In the mid-20s cars wouldn't have been that common so it was surprising to see the characters refer to different makes and ""car situations"" (standard shift? 60 mph?) so casually. However, I suppose this might have been designed to make the characters stand out as wealthy whereas now speaking casually about cars doesn't really have that effect."
1030,Fardila Metavia,"I once heard about how this book was a definite must read for classic novels, and oh boy, were they right! I picked up this novel just a day before I devoured each words and each phrases that were so enchantingly amusing that it kept me awake all night. The characterization of Jay Gatsby was depressingly beautiful, I always saw him as this young handsome gentlemen who does everything in suave motion, who talks suave, who walks suave, who does his hair in a suave manner and everytime I pictured the way he smiles, it somehow tugs the tip of my mouth to form a not so picturesque grin. At the first time I spotted the scene in where Nick Carraway caught talking with a man about a war at the first few pages of the book, I knew it was Gatsby all along. Because the way he talked and presented himself was perfectly well-mannered! I, then, followed the journey of how Gatsby, who was so desperately in love with Daisy, tried to arrange a meeting by using Nick as the bait. The scene where they finally met up that rainy afternoon were making me nervous, just like how Gatsby had been the first time he saw Daisy in the living room. I also found Ms. Jordan Baker very attractive that I longed to dress up like her someday. She was a true beauty, quite arrogant and acted all mighty, but that was his definite charm, I suppose. It's a pity that her relationship with Nick doesn't go well because I always imagine gorgeous woman like her to be ended up with a good man like Nick.Otherwise, the whole plot about Gatsby as the perfect representation of The Great American Dream's paradox was beautifully told throughout the book. It placed down everything about that Jazz Era, the after 1919 war effect that created plenty of joyous American's parties, the Wall Street's commotion, the short-haired woman, the illuminating lights of New York, the cheap tricks, the hidden secrets, the affairs and the tragic depiction of the low-class man... it was honestly told by Fitzgerald, making it the perfect novel to portray the American Dream. Achieving it is nearly impossible and The Great Gatsby is the perfect representation because the love and happiness he painfully seeks are impossible to obtain. Daisy had fleet away like birds flapping through the window. Its wings spread out wide, the sun is shimmering down into its thick white fur and the summer breeze blows past it, while the bird cries out loud...This book makes me want to know more about Fitzgerald and his works. The Great Gatsby is such a great start."
1031,Procyon Lotor,"Qualche critico lo ha stigmatizzato lamentandosi che manca il sociale. Per secoli ci si � interrogati quando l'anima veniva insufflata nell'essere umano. Su di noi pi� o meno i filosofi hanno raggiunto un accordo, su certi critici ancora ci si interroga. Un uomo lotta per essere desiderabile. Quando lo diventa, � cambiata lei, sono cambiati i tempi eccetera. Gatsby pu� tutto ma non tornare indietro. L'impotenza del potere negli anni ruggenti. Cos� assurdamente ed epicamente romantico che lo consiglierei anche a chi un libro simile lo straccerebbe non potendo prendere a schiaffi l'autore urlandogli ""come puoi permetterti di farmi questo?"" NON � una storia che rimane inchiodata agli anni '20. I chiodi te li pianta a te."
1032,Joshua Miller,"In this astounding novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, he creates a forbidden love story illustrated in the Roaring 20's. When war veteran, Nick Carraway moves to the West Egg to settle down as a bondsman, his ambitions aren't fulfilled in the way he wants it to. Realizing and slowly unraveling the mystery of his magnificent neighbor, the eccentric Jay Gatsby, he soon becomes involved in a plan to reunite Gatsby with his previous lover and Nick's cousin, Daisy Buchanan. Yet after seeing the struggles and complications in reuniting these Jay and Daisy, including the fact that she is already married, the question arrises if whether they should really be reunited.I'd recommend this book to people who like romance stories. It's practically a 1920's version of Romeo and Juliet. The story not only shows a passionate love story with a hint of action and excitement, but it also shows the lengths that some people will go in order to unite with their true love. Gatsby must've been desperate to re-unite with Daisy as shown by the fact that he continued to love her, even though he already knew she was married. That is why I recommend this book to romance fans."
1033,bitmaid,"I had to finish it in one sitting. It was a good read, and I love how miserable it is.I read it from elsewhere that this book (and some other books) of Fitzgerald is a manifestation of his own delirium. It went on and on about how each major dejecting or uplifting event instilled some sense of grief, longing or vengeance into his work, and this one has to do with a lady called Ginevra King. I enjoyed reading Hemingway's comments about his tortured friend almost as much as I enjoyed this book. So that's why this book feels so real- because it kind of is. There isn't a redundant character in it, because I imagine everyone who appeared in the book was inspired by someone Fitzgerald knew in real life, even the owl-eyed man. But even without knowing any of this, you can still taste the bitterness in it from the beginning. What a classical set up. The sadness in it is very much palpable. The parties Gatsby threw and all the fantastic luxuries that were displayed in his mansion and with Daisy struck me as nothing but phantom, and turns out they are just that. It only feels real when he started with the rain and the mud, and the collapse of Gatsby's confidence as he was shaken by his own imagination, and how close it may come true. He moved a greenhouse to Nick's house, cut his grass, and showed up there miserably- to me it was as if the funeral had already begun.But Daisy is just another female character hated by an obsessed man who forced this untouchable exaltation on her and crushed her with his morals. Fitzgerald hated women so much. I mean, he is an okay writer, he is a pretty chilling character himself (not chill, that's for sure). But I'm not going to read another book of his because I already know he's going to talk about the same shit over and over again. As far as I'm concerned, he is a failure that he considered himself to be... as a man, but not as a writer. I already said he's an okay writer."
1034,the gift,"read this yet again probably six times now, inspired by critical/bio work So we read on: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...... just decided to read it to see if I can catch the romance. heartbreaking. gatsby is the kind of man a seventeen year old would imagine, yes even if I was probably only fifteen when first read it... grew up comfortably, secure, not poor but not society... but could always identify with his romantic readiness, so rec this to all my efriends just to give it a chance, read it again, marvel at the clarity, the design, the concision, the lyrical passages... found this copy designed as mock-pulp, but have to remember it is related to popular culture of its time. this is now almost another world hundred years past but is not dated... is forever... will be able to quote the last paragraph forever...first review on goodreads: what is there to say of this? short novel that contains far more than word count suggests, the only thing i can mention is that this is very definitely sentimental favorite, as probably the first novel i saw as art capital a. read first when i was fifteen, read a few times since, this bittersweet romance encapsulates both how i wanted to believe self was something i could entirely create, and how, whether this was worthwhile, the way to live was to love and do everything for love. heartbreaking for my youth, only after some realtime relationships could i question these ideas. remains something i can recommend to any woman who is interested in figuring me out. i can quote many lines, i can quote the ending paragraphs, i can only wish i could ever write anything so simple, beautiful, and pure."
1035,Andrea Blythe,"I remember being completely confounded by this book in high school. It was required reading, after all, about which we were forced to discuss the symbolism of the green dock light and the rain and many other things, all of which felt like work and was entirely uninteresting to me at the time. Not to mention that my reading interests were less focused on the poetry of language than the entertainment of the plot (Stephen King was a big hit with me at the time).Reading it again now, I am struck with how profoundly beautiful this book is. The writing is clean, simple, and gorgeous, and while many of the characters in the book are not easily likeable, they are certainly fascinating. The Great Gatsby has now been added to my list of favorites."
1036,Jeremy Muse,"Truth of the matter is, I wasn't supposed to like this book. Forced reading at the High School level = torture, in my mind.But I was shocked at how much I actually enjoyed this book. First, this book could have been a romance, but Fitzgerald really ignored that part of the story, which I applaud. He also could have given a lot of detail to that timeframe, but he didn't, and again, I applaud. The book was amazingly fast paced, gave you insight to Gatsby slowly, instead of all at once. And most importantly, I really liked Nick and Gatsby. They could have been two guys that I wouldn't mind hanging out with. Of course there are a couple of characters in there I despised, and I think that was supposed to happen. An insight of the way my mind thinks, I thought this book was about a car.What surprised me most was how the last two chapters ended. Frankly, I didn't see all the death coming. And even though it was a bit disturbing, I liked how it wasn't a happy ending. See Jeremy, you should have read more in High School. Ender's Game is the next High School book I'm reading. I hope it's as good as this one."

1038,Courtney Lindwall,"At first I thought I was going to hate this book. I didn't want to read about wealthy, obnoxious people who go to self-impressed, obnoxious parties. I thought the writing might be too highbrow or too dense. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. When you approach a classic as big as The Great Gatsby, it can be daunting. Especially because I'd never read anything by Fitzgerald before. But, to my surprise -- I absolutely loved this book. I fell in love with Nick Carraway, the narrator. I fell in love with the writing. I fell in love with the 20s, Gatsby's parties, and the bizarre but magnificently intimidating social circles of New York's elite. Carraway was kind, removed from the gaudiness of East Egg, an observer in a world he didn't (nor particularly want) to understand. His fascination with Gatsby brought about my own. In a subtle way, he laughed at it all. He was amazed by it -- stunned, perhaps. But he didn't take it seriously just the same. Gatsby was, of course, flawed in a lot of ways. His dreams of his life with Daisy didn't take into account that Daisy was a human being of her own, whose dreams probably didn't allign exactly with his. She wasn't just a pawn in his fantasies. But even still, I felt so bad for Gatsby. His life was incredibly tragic. There's something that absolutely breaks my heart about people who are living in the past, about people who are so dependent upon the love and acceptance of others. Gatsby, on the outside, was an ornate, powerful, man of the town. On the inside, he was a sad, poor boy with a broken heart. And Fitzgerald wrote about it all brilliantly. The time shifts, the way the reader finds out about Gatsby through twists and turns, the wonderful prose. It all just hit the right pitch. "
1039,Mare,It was a bit boring until the end- everything got meaning then =) Love ithttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rARN6a...
1040,Marc,"One of the best novels of the 21st century, I especially love how much he says in such a short book. It's never boring or long winded. Just straight to the point. Even those not especially engaged with the time period or story will be struck by his beautiful prose. Gatsby made the fatal mistake of believing there is just one person in the world for you when a person can find happiness with many people. There are no ""soul mates"". That's pure fantasy bs and Jay Gatsby found out the hard way. An American classic, read it now if you haven't."
1041,Ned,"A soap opera of a story dressed in the most heartbreakingly wonderful language, language that is both magical and devastating, leaving me at its end sensitively aware of how beautifully sad this world can be."
1042,Ritesh Bhagwati,"So finally I finished up with this short story by Mr. Fitzgerald. About this book, even though I took quite a lot of time in completing the book, it was intentional and unintentional at a same time. I wanted to experience the book before the movie gets released in here. For the book, I liked the story of Mr. Mysterious (Gatsby), though I didn't like the end. I think writer could have done more to it rather than making it a send ending. Book was too short for an imagination to sink in the story. I felt it was more of a like straight-storytelling-no-bullshitting. Though this was my first book read from this author, I may be not very accurate about his style of writing. Anyways overall in the end, I shall definitely recommend everyone to go through this book if they haven't yet, at least before you tend to watch it in theatre when movie releases. If not then at least read it soon. It is surely a page turner, easy read."
1043,Brandon,"I have re read this many times and remember the symbolism as one of the brilliant aspects of Fitzgerald's genius, but my most recent read disturbed me far more than any past read. The death of Myrtle, the lurid secondhand details of her flopping breast, coupled with the stark absence of emotion from Daisy and Jay who while not willing participants of the accident bear some portion of responsibility. As an indictment of American ideals (and perhaps in light of the recent Wall street collapse and Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme) I can't help but feel that we embody the same mores. We still ignorantly stratisfy our society based upon cupidity. While it is certainly more fluid, is it any more effective than a class system based upon birth? Myrtles death while a factor in the death of Jay Gatz is also overshadowed and minimized by the murder. While death is ultimate equalizer, the ramifications of our lives do not end in our death, but act like ripples in a body of water. Perhaps my discomfort arises from the realization that the world shown by Fitzgerald is still one I would want to inhabit, but my moral compass can't rectify the erosion neccessary and exemplified by the illegal transactions that support the neauveau riche Mr. Gatsby, as well as the irresponsible and effectual cold hearted responses of Daisy and Tom. "
1044,Ellen,I loved this. It was beautiful and tragic. 
1045,Mars,"I think ""The Great Gatsby"" is a very interesting, thought-provoking book and I also think that F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing is quite beautiful. Of course he is an absolute wordsmith, as well as having a knack for creating wonderful imagery. I am glad to have read this widely loved classic. Even friends of mine who are reluctant readers, especially of classics, have read and liked this book. What's more, this novel is quite short. So, I would recommend it to just about anyone - including people that aren't big on reading in the first place.The primary theme of the corruption of the true American Dream during the Jazz Age is well represented in the novel. And, I think it can still resonate with readers to this day. Jay Gatsby is an intriguing character and the air of mystery around him made me want to read on. He starts out as this distant, almost majestic figure that is the subject of admiration, wonder, speculation, and gossip. As the narrator, Nick Carraway, comes to know Gatsby, Gatsby's motives, his past and his flaws are revealed. Gatsby is caught in an illusion. His dreams, his nostalgia, and his idea of love are all deluded and can never amount to anything. The book also focuses on Carraway's disillusionment with the people he has met, their wealthy lifestyles, and their poor attitudes. Overall, the book seems to favor turning away from loosening values and a glitzier lifestyle and instead turning back toward traditional values and a more genuine pursuit of happiness, represented by life back West in Minnesota."
1046,Yesshereads,"É a década de 1920, a famosa era do Jazz, e Nick Carraway, o narrador, acaba de se mudar para Nova York. Ele, falido, vai para uma casa simples em West Egg onde se torna vizinho do riquíssimo Gatsby, um ex soldado famoso por suas grandes festas no jardim sempre regadas a muita música, champagne e pessoas da alta sociedade. A história atinge ponto alto assim que Gatsby e a prima de Nick Carraway – Daisy – se reencontram. Ambos tiveram uma história no passado e Gatsby viveu anos alimentando o sonho de reconquista-la.Em boa parte do livro o leitor fica apenas conhecendo os personagens e às festas maravilhosas do Sr. Gatsby, pois o romance só começa na metade do livro. O personagem principal ficamos conhecendo mais através de comentários e fofocas feitas por terceiros. A narrativa é maravilhosa e detalhada. Publicado em 1925, apesar do livro ser pequeno (em torno de 150 páginas), não só é considerado o mais famoso do Fitzgerald, como também um clássico da literatura. Existe, inclusive, um filme feito a partir desta obra, mas nunca assisti... agora não vejo a hora!! Amei!"
1047,Ethan Warren,"Well...I watched the Baz Luhrman film and was captivated by Gatsby: I was in awe. I loved everything about the film, and i was desperate to read the book. I pestered my friends for a very long time in order to borrow the book, and eventually my friend Nadia gave me the book as a leaving present. I immediately immersed myself in the world of Jay Gatsby. And just wow. F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing is just spectacular, and there is no other to whom he can be compared.I stopped reading the book when I left Qatar. Somehow I felt that the situation I was in at the time wasn't worthy enough for me to merit reading The Great Gatsby, to continue his story. But also I knew. I'd seen the film and knew the ending. I'd also reached the point in the story right before the climax of the novel. I didn't want to read on. I suppose I didn't want to finish the story, to continue the charade. That is the power of Gatsby. That is the power of Fitzgerald's writing.So for an entire summer I hid away the book. Until today, when after all this time, I found the book again. It triggered a sadness in me, and a part of me begged myself to simply put the book away again, but I know that all good things must come to an end, so I finished it. It's an emotional trip, there's no denying that. This book...it's so much. Hopes and dreams. It's one of the greatest stories of all time and my favourite book. I'd recommend it to absolutely anybody, and maybe someday once I've recovered from the emotions that are still rocking me, I'll re-read The Great Gatsby."

1049,Bryan D.,"Arguably the most significant work by any American author, The Great Gatsby IS American literature. Fitzgerald is quite often credited with writing the most beautiful and most poetic prose of any 20th century American writer, and this novel is a true testament to the validity of this bold statement.From its first pages, Fitzgerald's self-proclaimed ""tour de force"" immerses the reader in a world filled with mystery (who the heck IS this Jay Gatsby guy anyway?). Then, with perfect calculation and precision worthy of a brain surgeon, Fitzgerald slowly draws back the curtain on his masterpiece. As the reader is plunged deeper and deeper into the dysfunctionally decadent world that is West Egg, he can neither resist nor stomach the too-smooth-to-be-genuine charm of Gatsby. Equally intriguing is the intertwined plotline that unfolds as Gatsby casually barges into the lives of his old flame, Daisy Buchanan, her husband, Tom, and their friends. These characters, whose empty lives are driven almost solely by their own pretention and their 'new money,' are balanced delicately by the calm, steady, and internally conflicted narration of Daisy's cousin, Nick. As Nick adjusts to his new life in New York (having just recently moved from another state...Minnesota, I think), his fresh point-of-view is, by the novel's midpoint, established as a major impetus of the novel as it begins to be juxtaposed with the dishonest and hurtful lifestyles of his cousin and her friends. As Nick begins to reluctantly, as well as subconsciously, become a part of this lifestyle, the inner struggle he undergoes serves as Fitzgerald's vehicle for the theme of the book. Nick is ultimately left to decide; he can enjoy the glitz and glamour of this way of life, or he can avoid the self-destruction that comes along with it. He cannot, however, do both. While the novel is known for its messages concerning the American Dream, it is Nick's choice that lies at the heart of The Great Gatsby. It is a wonderfully written work that reveals itself more and more upon second (and third, and fourth...) reading, and anyone who can relate to this life-changing (albeit subtle) decision will undoubtedly feel immensely rewarded at the novel's end. A must-read for every true book lover, literary enthusiast, and American, The Great Gatsby should be on your ""To-Read"" shelf, if it isn't already on your ""Read"" shelf."
1050,Meg ♥,"I first had to read this book for school years ago, and have since read it about 8-10 more times. I love this book and I love to reread it over and over again. I get excited reading about the jazz age, and to me this book never gets old. Fitzgerald's depiction of the corrupt, and disillusioned society of the Jazz Age is amazing. In this book, he captures the impending disaster Gatsby faces, as well as his search for meaning in a meaningless society. Almost every character in this book is shallow and unlikeable, but I still find Gatsby's love for Daisy rather sweet."
1051,Ashley DeVrieze,"I just read a thread discussing whether this is a wonderful or terrible book, so I feel like I need to share my personal review. Gatsby is one of my favorite books now, but in high school I didn't see any of the things that make me love it today. I was preoccupied by the general selfishness and darkness of the characters, and at age 16 that wasn't something I wanted to relate to. Who likes something so ugly as this situation where people lie and cheat and are generally miserable? Years later, I still hope I'm not like them, but I can see more than I would let myself before. Their situations aren't just black and white to me - and the gray is what makes the book interesting.Most importantly, I can see the writing. Reading aloud is perfect - his descriptions are pure poetry: ""In his enchanted gardens, men and girls came and went like moths, among the whispering and the champagne and the stars.""The characters are selfish and lonely and the story is heartbreaking, but all of it is made into a beautiful sort of sadness that I can't get over. If you're a high school student and you don't like it, I hear ya - I didn't either - but just the same, try it in 5 or 10 years with an open mind. I'm so glad I read it again. "
1052,Christoffer Betting,"The Great Gatsby, written by Scott Fitzgerald, was an inspiring and entertaining read. The author beautifully utilizes a very elegant diction, which draws in the reader, and makes sure you are always paying attention to the development of the story. Especially his clever use of figurative language serves to highlight the importance of Jay Gatsby’s situation. Fitzgerald creates a triangle love drama between Jay Gatsby, Daisy and Tom to create a more dynamic story line, which was key for my interest to remain constant, and the novel entertaining. The three’s constant quest for true love lays waste to innocent victims. In the end, their love issues broaden to what becomes an ethical massacre by Fitzgerald, as he portrays how love can make one completely blind and determined. At first, Fitzgerald leaves the reader with a gullible and happy feeling. However, as the deception rises between the characters, the reader also becomes aware of the gloomier picture depicted by the author. Thus, the story is all about deception and lies, and how the real world differs from that of our dreams."

1054,Gary  the Bookworm,"This is usually assigned in high school which spoils it for many people. That is too bad because it is such a powerful tale of America between the world wars. Fitzgerald explored themes as lofty as the erosion of the American Dream, and as personal as unrequited love and the loss of innocence.
There are no winners in this dark tale of America adrift during the Jazz Age. In retrospect we can see just how prescient his vision was. The violence he described, both random and premeditated, came to define America in the 20th Century. The 1929 Stock Market Crash and the ensuing Great Depression were brought about by shady business deals like those between Gatsby and Meyer Wolfson. 
The tension between old and new money, represented by Tom Buchanan and Gatsby, drove our political conversation for decades. The Lost Generation became the Beats who stepped aside for the Hippies. Common to all of them was an aching awareness that America was teetering on the brink of disaster. Fitzgerald may have succumbed to his private demons, but this short novel, his masterpiece, still packs a wallop. (view spoiler)[.

1055,Michelle Rugamba,"The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a novel that needs all your attention, as it is not an easy book to understand from the beginning. Personally, it took me a few chapters to finally get a hang of what was going on. In a nutshell, the Great Gatsby is about the American dream and the struggle that occurs when trying to achieve this dream. The ""American dream"" has been debated by many individuals as to whether it is completely fabricated, or if it actually exists. This book is quite the interesting read as it shows the differences between the East Egg, if you come from a wealthy family, and the West Egg, if you are newly rich. These two extremes are separated by the valley of ashes, which is where the ""poor"" people live. This novel teaches you lessons that you never imagined to get out of from such a book. This novel makes you wonder why people from other parts of the world make their way to the United States in trying to obtain this ""American dream"" that may not even occur or become a reality. I highly suggest that every individual should read this book as it makes you realize things you've never thought of before, and is a book everyone must experience in his or her life. Finally, I recommend everyone to READ THE BOOK BEFORE WATCHING THE MOVIE!"
1056,Chris Gager,"Just started last night/this morning for a few pages. My edition is about this old I guess, and hardbound too, but is solid blue and rather haphazardly put together.Now into it and sensing the futility of expecting 15-16 year old kids to appreciate this. I ""tried"" in high school like many others but failed. Now I give it 5 stars already. Beautiful writing... An amazing mixture of idealism, cynicism and some descriptive lyric beauty thrown in here and there for the heck of it. Certainly ""Winter Dreams"" is a fore-runner of this story. The narrator of that tale of lost love has been split into two characters for this book: Gatsby and Nick. Daisy's the offspring of Judy Jones in ""Winter Dreams"". Much evocation of Eliot's poetry so far: The Ash Valley(a Wasteland), ""men and women came and went""(Prufrock) etc. Certainly the characters seem to be Hollow Men. Notes:- The apartment ""party"" is awful and awesome.- Tom might be Michelle Bachman's granddaddy.- The writing is economical and ultra modern for it's time.- Jordan might be Jane Blaylock's grandma.- What is non-olfactory money? untainted by crime and corruption???(I just looked on Yahoo answers and that's pretty much it)And now finished with this short and bittersweet American classic. Best book ever? In the running for sure. Incredibly well written and compelling. The language is so lovely... Of course it about the rottenness at the core of the American Dream. Love and money conquers all. Or not... Gatsby is the white knight on his quest but doomed by his obsessive/non-realistic mind-set. The loner looking for just the one perfect thing. Notes:- Many authors have taken from this book. How about Nelson DeMille for ""The Gold Coast"" and ""The Gate House""?- Nick, like Marlow(with Kurtz) in ""The Heart of Darkness"" admires the outlaw-dreamer.- Daisy - molto charming but no guts at all.- Gatsby lost his dream 'cause he was poor and could never catch up with time and it's changes.- Nick, the omniscient narrator knows stuff he shouldn't(or wouldn't in the real world). Like what happened at the garage after the accident. Oh well, it's literature...- No wonder literature scholars love the book. It's so modern in it's prose and sensibility. Only occasionally does it sound stilted(like Sinclair Lewis for example).- Upon meeting Tom on the street in Manhattan: ""- rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.""??? Seems awkward... experimental perhaps? A misprint?-Fitzgerald on life at the end. We long for the past and can never get a hold of the present, which is continuously becoming the past. Yikes!- There's a definite literary/emotional connection between TGG and ""Lolita"". Obsessed romantic ""heroes""...Five stars easy..."

1058,Kacey Koch,"The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is an amazing book set in New York in the 1920s. The narrator Nick, is cousins with a woman named Daisy who was once in love with a man named Gatsby. Gatsby was said to be educated at Oxford, and went to the army to serve his country. Before he left, he fell in love with Daisy, but was forced away from her due to the war. In hopes of getting her back after the war, Gatsby threw extravagant parties and invited anyone who wanted to come. Through the help of Nick, Gatsby is able to find love again, but this time, it came with a price.Due to the beautiful syntax that F. Scott Fitzgerald uses throughout the novel, I rate this book a five out of five. Fitzgerald's articulate use of syntax allows the beauty of the story to be portrayed easily and consistantly. I absolutely love the way he developed the plot through each character, and used an outside character to be an important aspect of the story. His ability to create drama, love, and fun all together makes this book one I would recommend to any one willing to take the time to sit down and read it. It is a short read because of size and the fact that it is so difficult to put down. "
1059,Debby,I just listened to this again (Frank Muller reader) so that I could have it in my head before Baz Luhrman annihilates my images. The dude can write and create characters. I recommend listening to it because then you aren't able to read too quickly; you can appreciate the beauty of the writing. 
1060,Noor Ismail,"I finished reading the book today, then went on to watch the most recent movie online. Honestly there were some parts the movie cleared up. I had no idea the whole novel was a flashback, or that Tom's Mistress died. Even the man who killed Gatsby, I was unclear of his motives. However after watching the movie it all makes sense. I think it was the language of the novel. I plan on re-reading the book again one day in the future. I'm glad it's a required book to read in high school, I don't think it should be mandatory, but I'm still glad it was recommended. As for the story itself, I think it's a brilliant plot. There are so many hidden symbols that I enjoy finding. The green light was obvious, but the weather, and even Nick were interesting. Daisy represents greed. Tom is a wealthy racist. The light represented Gatsby's hopes and dreams of the future. Nick represented honesty, because he was the honestly civilly honest character throughout the whole book. He hosted and attended as the only person during the funeral, yet he even felt unhappy whole being in the whole city. Plus he was right, Daisy, his cousin, basically destroyed Gatsby's life. If it wasn't for her, the poor man would have succeeded much more in life. And if it wasn't for Tom, Gatsby wouldn't be dead at all. Daisy killed Tom's Mistress and Tom killed Daisy's lover. Daisy and Tom lived together and on, while many other lost in the process. The American Dream is completely destroyed in this novel, but maybe it's for the better. There isn't a happy ending because it's realistic fiction. Some things I'm still unclear about are:The only compliment Nick have Gatsby, about the crowd, what did that mean?In the movie, who was the last man to visit Nick? Could it have been Gatsby's father like in the book? But wasn't that the same man who was on the boat while Gatsby spent 5 year in the sea?Did the movie completely not include Gatsby's father in the ending? Where did Gatsby get all his money? Was he a dealer? Stocks?If Gatsby was a war hero, shouldn't that have gotten him some money?Why didn't anyone come to his funeral?"
1061,Ana Albutiu,"I thought this book was utterly beautiful, proof of actual literary talent, i.e. forging words to convey emotions and portray realities. It was plainly the writing style, the ingenious use of words that made this book for me. I actually didn't much care for the storyline, the characters or some higher meaning, but I genuinely admire this work of art nonetheless."
1062,Stacey,I read this in HS. I didn't think I would EVER revisit it. Ugh. So glad I did! I loved everything about it.

I know that when I started to read this book, at first I was getting ready to fall asleep. Although, the introduction didn’t quite catch my attention the second, and third page did. This is because it starts to explain a little bit about who Gatsby is, and how he affected the narrator. For example, it states “No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.” This quote helps the reader identify, and understand Gatsby’s character.Which is very important to pay attention to, because Gatsby is a confusing man , and he has different ways of showing his interests, and likes which wouldn’t be considered a norm to the average person. This is what made me fall in love with this book, because the author gives u the brief description of a man who is very temperament, but at the same time is a hopeless romantic. Which is a rare combination that has ever been put together. I know that I wasn’t too sure how anyone could write a love story about a heart broken man, who is bitter but does not show it, and regretful but covers it up with the parties of the early 1920s. This is makes the reader wonder how life could ever be so awful for this man who has everything anyone has ever dreamed of, but life still isn’t good enough. It gives a theme of not judging someone based on their appearance, or what they have, because they could be hurting maybe not physically, but emotionally. It shows how having everything may not really make a person happy and content, It’s about whose there for u, and who u could share your life and possessions with. This book made me want to actually meet the girl who made Gatsby determined, and so charming. When F.Scott Fitzgerald introduces her (Daisy) he makes her seem content with life , and grateful for ever being born. When he describes her husband( Tom Buchanan)he makes him seem like the guy of every girls dream, but he leaves out one hatred detail, and unforgiving action this men posses. Which personally shocked me, and put me in the shoes of Daisy. It makes the reader feel the sorrow, and regret daisy so easily hides. It gives the reader the perspective of being on the inside personally, and viewing it on the outside through the narrators eyes."
1064,Autumn,"This book was absolutely fantastic! Everything, the plot, characters, description - agh! Simply beautiful.The characters were beautifully put together. You thought you knew so much about them, but in reality they were so mysterious. I did like learning about Gatsby from an outsiders perspective of him. It was like there was no real getting to know him, he just popped up like he was your best friend and it felt like he was your best friend even though you knew nothing about it. Daisy was so sweet (even if she was a little ditzy) and just the was you saw her grow. Tom.... Even though I hated him, his development was great.The plot was so interesting, even though I felt like there wasn't a tone of plot until later on in the story. And near the end, I was just like ""What?... What!?.... WHAT!?"" I thought the descriptions were beautiful, but sometimes confusing. My favorite scene had to be when you first went to Daisy and Tom's house and how Mr. Fitzgerald described how the summer breeze was making the girls dress flow and the curtains snap. Just can't get over it...All and all, even though it is slightly scanty (Well, old days scanty), it is a great book and I would recommend it to anyone who wanted a great book."
1065,David Fulmer,"This brief novel about a hopeless, lovesick romantic, the Great Gatsby of the title, is full of all the longing, materialism, craziness, desperation, and need for acceptance you can find in American life and history, what Fitzgerald has narrator Nick Carraway refer to as “spectroscopic gayety”. Its characters have become classic American types: Tom Buchanan the rich Yale football player jerk; his wife Daisy the ultimate trophy wife in her white roadster with her green dock light and a voice full of money; Jordan Baker, the desiring and desirable miscreant golfer; and Nick Carraway the bitter narrator, who had so many advantages, who turned to the unending work of learning the bond trade but who got drawn into the life of Gatsby with devastating consequences for his own worldview, deeply divided though his reaction is to the unfolding tragedy he witnesses. Uniting them all at the endless parties he throws at his Long Island estate is Gatsby whose love is undying, whose idealism is perfect, whose faith in himself is limitless and whose love for Daisy means everything to him. His determination to repeat the past and win back the love of Daisy puts in motion a tragedy even his vast fortune can’t derail. The vision of this novel is deeply moral, but the novel is also poetic in its appreciation for what characterizes American life, its particular beauty and depravity. Add to that the regional theme of Middle Westerners living on the East coast, and the vivid setting of the the wild parties of New York, and what you have is a novel which expresses an attractive though highly critical summation of the American character."
1066,Celine," The Great Gatsby By F. Scott. Fitzgerald180pp. USAScribner, $14.00ISBN: 0-7432-7356-7Set in 1922, Long Island was divided into the West and East Eggs. Those who lived in the West were the rich who were less fashionable and lacked in grace and taste, but had personality. Those who lived in the East were the aristocrats who were fashionable and elegant, but lacked in generosity. The story is narrated when Nick Carraway, a young man from Minnesota decides to move to the West Egg one summer. Once there, he talks about his mysterious and intimidating neighbor, Jay Gatsby, who lives in a massive mansion next door. Once in a while, Mr. Gatsby would throw magnificent parties in which tons of rich people attend, whether invited or not. One afternoon, he goes to have dinner with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, who used to be Nick’s classmate at Yale. Arriving at their home in the East Egg, Nick meets a beautiful lady, Jordan Baker, who he eventually dates. Through talking to her, he soon learns about Tom’s affair with another woman. Not long after that evening, Tom goes to New York with Nick and it is confirmed that he indeed has an affair, with a woman named Myrtle Wilson, who is wife to another man. As time passes by slowly, Nick is finally invited to one of Mr. Gatsby’s parties. There, he meets Mr. Gatsby himself, a cheerful Oxford man, who has a habit of calling everyone ‘old sport.’ Nick finds him really appealing and unlike most of the people at the party, he seemed ingenuous and sincere. Surprisingly, Jordon Baker was also at the party and Mr. Gatsby finds time to speak to her about his love and admiration for her friend, Daisy. Through Jordan, Nick learned of this issue and is requested by Mr. Gatsby to plan a gathering for the two long lost lovers. As asked for, Nick does the favor and invites Daisy over to his home for tea. The get-together wasn’t the most interesting, but it allowed Mr. Gatsby and Daisy to fall for each other all over again. Because Daisy does have a smart and observant husband, Tom was able to tell that Daisy was in an affair with Gatsby. Through several meetings, Tom became suspicious of Gatsby through his emotion filled glances and admiration for his wife. Tom was furious because although he had been cheating, he couldn’t accept the fact that his wife was disloyal to him. To settle the problem, Tom, Jordan, Daisy, Gatsby, and Nick drive to the Plaza Hotel in New York. There, Tom confronts Gatsby, and not regretting what he has done, Gatsby admits. The two men argue over who would make the better half for Daisy and it is here when Daisy realizes that Tom is the better. Leaving New York in two cars; Mr. Gatsby and Daisy driving Tom’s car and Nick, Jordan and Tom driving Mr. Gatsby’s car, the latter soon discovers that Tom and Daisy had hit Myrtle and she is dead. The three rushes back home and conversing with Gatsby, Nick hears the story. Although Daisy was the one driving, Gatsby is willing to take the blame. As for Tom, this incident was a perfect way for him to eliminate Gatsby. The very next day, he pays a visit to George, Myrtle’s husband and tells him that Gatsby killed his wife. Without further ado, George finds Gatsby, shoots him, and then shoots himself. Nick is extremely shocked, knowing that Gatsby didn’t deserve to die. Having only met Gatsby for a summer, it was enough to tell Nick that he was a good person. Gatsby was humble, a man of his words, and most definitely, a man who stood up to his problems. Sorrowfully, Nick arranges a funeral for Gatsby and contacts people to go. Unfortunately, only one of Gatsby’s friends and his father ended up going. At this point, Nick had a clear view of the world, of society, and of people. Of the hundreds of people that went to Gatsby’s parties, only one person came and this proved to Nick that people only do what they do for advantages. And through Daisy and Tom, he saw clearly the behavior of the snobby rich. They used money to get away with everything and to avoid trouble, they left East Egg. These thoughts taunted Nick, and as a result, he broke up with Jordan, who he found sly, and left West Egg as well. u> The Great Gatsby is an excellent book that I would recommend to anyone. The ending was very surprising and unexpected, which I really liked. The text itself is also written really well. The characters were well described in the book and I really admired Mr. Gatsby. The text may be a little difficult to understand, but it was definitely an awesome story."
1067,Alina Vostrotina,"Сейчас уже не вспомню, почему знакомство с творчеством Фицджеральда начала не с общепризнанного шедевра, в настоящее время для большинства являющегося ассоциацией с именем американского писателя. Всегда придерживаюсь мнения, что прочитать хорошую книгу никогда не поздно, тем не менее, благодарна премьере экранизации Лурмана, которая форсировала знакомство с данным произведением - узнать сперва первоисточник для меня является обязательным. Зная стиль Фицджеральда по прочитанным ранее ""По эту сторону рая"" и ""Ночь нежна"" с обильными описаниями образов, деталей, лирическими отступлениями, которые могут показаться излишне затянутыми, не ждала от романа стремительного развития сюжета и наслаждалась красочностью описываемых событий, точностью формулировок, создающих объемную картинку, и простотой языка. Тем не менее, за всеми многочисленными эпитетами и рассуждениями героя, от лица которого идет повествование, сразу можно почувствовать интригу - интригу знакомства с главным героем. Фицджеральд дотрагивается до правды постепенно и деликатно, раскрывая истинную историю его жизни в нужный момент, при этом удерживая интерес к таинственности Гэтсби чуть ли не большую часть романа. А возвращаясь к простоте написания Фицджеральда, каким неожиданным оказывается лаконичное расписание дня и список общих решений Гэтсби.Субъективно, в произведениях Фицджеральда больше всего привлекает такое незамысловатое по сюжету, но в то же время тонкое раскрытие природы человеческих отношений. Писатель, являясь ярким представителем ""Века Джаза"" - достаточно узкого и своеобразного отрезка врмени - отразил через призму этого специфичного периода все то, что было, есть и будет свойственно человеку, когда, где и как бы он ни жил. Судьба, решения, отголоски прошлого и порой такое неясное будущее, любовь и преданность, измена и фальшь, материализм и ложные ценности, иллюзии и разочарование - актуальность растянется на век человеческий. ""Великим"" для общества Гэтсби сделало его идеальное представление о себе, присущее ему с юности, но был ли он на самом деле велик? Бессмысленность его смерти и восприятие этого события обществом и той, ради которой он сделал свой жизненный путь имеено таким, пожалуй, ответит на этот вопрос лучше всего.Не зацикливайтесь на ложных иллюзиях, созданных себе когда-то на почве душевных переживаний, потому что ""...пытаемся плыть вперед, борясь с течением, а оно все сносит наши суденышки обратно в прошлое""."
1068,Hannah Clark,"I've literally read this book a dozen times. And frankly, I think that I could read a dozen times more. Since seventh grade, I've held F. Scott Fitzgerald close to my heart, along with the Roaring Twenties . . . there's so much about Fitzgerald's writing that captures the essence of the Twenties perfectly . . . the alcohol ( illegal, might I add ), the parties, the sex and scandal . . . but he made it all seem classy. And that's one of the things that I love most about Fitzgerald. The Great Gatsby was his greatest masterpiece."
1069,Cass,"I always struggle to review classic literature. I am not naive or arrogant enough to imagine I will have any amazing incite based on a single reading and no real study. My first reaction, on finishing the book, was that I really didn't get what the fuss was about. I know this is a famous book, a top 100 book, a classic book that everyone should have read at some stage in their lives (I was first exposed to it in high school English, but I didn't really read it then). So when the book ended I felt like it lacked anything epic or grand or amazing, anything to make it worthy of this lofty position.But days later the book began to unpack itself. As the weeks went on I would think about the novel and my understanding grew. I began to notice things that were not clear while I was reading. I have spent a lot of time mulling of the characters in the book. Who they were and why they behaved the way they did. So spoiler alert. It is a book that saddened me the more I began to understand it. Here was a self-made man who had it all, but longed for a woman he had fallen in love with years ago. He gets her, he steals her away from a loveless marriage and they appear happy together. But the more I understand the characters the more I realise that she was not worthy of him. She was vapid, she loved being loved, but she did not love Gatsby with the same passion that he loved her. Very sad. This idea has played in my mind for weeks. "
1070,Anisa,"F. Scott Fitzgerald ' s The Great gatsby is filled with allusion to the ""American Dream"" criticism of capitalism and many other underlying themes to Daisy and Jay Gatsby ' s love. The Great Gatsby is told from the point of view of the young Nick Carraway. The Carraways are a family in the bond business, so nick goes to new York to learn the business. He ends up living in a small cottage by the famous and mysterious Jay Gatsby. Gatsby lives in a huge mansion that is the place of several parties frequently. Carraway and gatsby end up being friends and nick gets sucked unto the secretive life of Jay Gatsby . From Gatsby illegal underground business to his love affair with Daisy , Nick ' s cousin. I was first interested in it after I watched the movie starring Leonardo Dicaprio. I started reading it and I was amazed how exact the lines and dialog of the novel werr incorporated in the film. It made me appreciate the movie more and get more into the book. Reading the book also made me upset at the movies interpretation of the end. In the end no one shows up to gatsby ' s funeral besides Nick and Gatsby 's father, but in the movie Gatsby ' father does not show. However it still was a great read and the movie showed great similarities I appreciated and it was one of the best books I've read."
1071,Sean M,"Sean MellenMs. HayesEnglish Period 311/3/13The Great GatsbyThe Great Gatsby is a novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald it takes place in the summer of 1922. Jay Gatsby is obsessed with Daisy Buchanan from an earlier love affair but she married Tom Buchanan because he was set for money and Gatsby did not have any at the time. Gatsby and Daisy rekindle their relationship and they start hanging out pretty often but her husband Tom is really suspicious about it. When Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, Nick, and Jordan all go to New York City, Tom confronts Gatsby about his and Daisy’s relationship, Gatsby says Daisy loves her, Tom talks about her and Daisy’s history, he questions if he went to Oxford and he says that he made his millions by bootlegging alcohol, Daisy realizes that she loves Tom. Tom sends Daisy back to Long Island with Gatsby to prove he that cannot hurt him. The rest of them are driving home and find Myrtle Wilson (Tom had affair with her) we know they were having an affair because Miss Baker whispers to Nick ““Tom’s got some woman in New York””(15). She had been killed and it was by a car everyone around who saw it knew it was Gatsby’s yellow car, everyone thinks it was Gatsby but it was actually Daisy but he takes blame to protect her. Daisy’s husband George was suspicious about her having an affair and thought whoever killed her must have been her lover so he goes over to Gatsby’s house and shoots Gatsby and then kills himself. The theme of the story is The American Dream and how everyone eventually ends up where they belong.	My favorite character was Jay Gatsby. I liked how he never gave up on Daisy know matter what he always loved her some examples of this are the green light on Daisy’s dock and taking the blame for killing Myrtle. I liked how mysterious he is and sketchy especially about how he made his money it makes him seem really suspicious. Gatsby just seems like a cool guy. For example Daisy says to him “” you look so cool… you always look so cool””(119). It shows that he just comes off as the type of guy you want to be friends with the extravagant parties help that as well. I feel as if the Author intended this reaction to like Gatsby even though he was really mysterious and suspicious.	My Overall thoughts on this book were that it was great. This was one of the best books I have ever read. Everything came together and unraveled at the end. The plot was unbelievable the way it played out with Gatsby dying for what Daisy did. Yes I would recommend this book to someone else. The type of reader I would recommend this to is someone that likes a classical book with a great plot. "
1072,Joan,My all time favorite classic. I have read it several times and love the writing style and the story. What's not to love?
1073,bharat pantula,An eternal classic!
1074,Scott Campbell,"Truly a remarkable book, fully deserving of its accolades and station in the literary canon. The Great American Novel is ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" -- but ""Catcher in the Rye"" and ""Grapes of Wrath"" and ""The Great Gatsby"" are among the other usual suspects, as well they should be. This was a re-read for me following a middling attempt after college (would you believe an English major got through hIgh school and university programs never being assigned it?!) but this reading was made much more fruitful as an audiobook told by the outstanding Anthony Heald. ""Gatsby"" is packed with humanity and delightful little truths, as all great books are. But it is also quite cynical -- none of these characters are ""great"" people -- and Fitzgerald finishes it off in fine Shakespearean fashion. His narrative is thick with description, which can swamp younger readers (and lesser writers), and it is very much a work of its time (Roaring Twenties) and place (Long Island, just outside the city), giving it a certain immortality. Influenced by the movie trailers, I found myself picturing Leo DiCaprio as Gatsby (perfect casting!) and am very much looking forward to the new adaptation! "
1075,Kathryn Bashaar,"I read Gatsby in high school and had re-read it twice in adulthood, and never really got why it's considered The Great American Novel. I saw it as a period piece with no significance beyond the 1920s. I always had a fascination with Fitzgerald and his tragic relationship with Zelda, but I never really saw him as a writer whose work would endure through the ages. Then I read Maureen Corrigan's wonderful So We Read On: How The Great Gatsby Came to Be and Why It Endures and thought I should re-consider. I'm a big-time book geek, but I tend to get so engrossed in a good story that I read it too fast and miss a lot of nuance. So I readily admit that I often need to be told how to read a book. And so I read Gatsby a fourth time, with a better map to its themes, and determined to slow down and savor the language. And that made a huge difference for me. Fitzgerald was meticulous about words, and it shows in lovely phrases like ""Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor"" and ""I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors' eyes - a fresh, green breast of the new world""And then there are those breathtaking last two paragraphs - which are, of course, not at all ""just"" about Gatsy nor even just about the striving excesses of the 1920s. I'd go further than Corrigan and argue that they aren't even just about The ""American"" Dream. I'd argue that they're about The HUMAN Dream. For all of us, what we dream, hope and strive for is always so much more perfect that what we can actually attain. Gatsby is the man who doesn't give up his ideals, even in the face of crushing discouragement. That is what Nick sees and admires in him. Set aside the unsavory ways that Gatsby made his money and his debauched parties. I think what poor, tragic Fitzgerald was saying is that the important thing, the most gloriously, tragically HUMAN thing about us is that we continue to hope and strive."
1076,Adi,"This is a damn near perfect book. A dream to any literary nerd or romantic that loves a twist. I absolutely loved it, and it'll forever be along the top of my list of favorites."
1077,Elizabeth Pyjov,"I think this is the finest English prose of the 20th century. It has to be read in English and not in translation. This is a book to read and reread! I just reread it after ten years and loved it even more. Favorite parts from one of my favorite books:[Nick Carraway] ""In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought -- frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon"" (1)""Reserving judgment is a matter of infinite hope."" (2)""... a sense of the fundamental decencies is parceled out unevenly at birth"" (2)[about Jay Gatsby]: ""If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the 'creative temperament' -- it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No -- Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams and temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrow and short-winded elations of men."" (2)""And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer."" (4)""The most limited of all specialists, the 'well-rounded man.' This isn't just an epigram - life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all."" (4)[about Tom Buchanan] ""... one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anticlimax"" (6):) [about Tom and Daisy] ""Why they came East I don't know. They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together."" (6)[first appearance of Daisy] ""The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise -- she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression -- then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room.'I'm p-paralyzed with happiness.'She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one else in the world she so much wanted to see."" (8-9)[Daisy] ""I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered ""Listen,"" a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that tehre were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour."" (9)[Daisy and Jordan] ""Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a police pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained."" (12)[Nick's first time at Tom and Daisy's] ""Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at the table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one, and yet avoid all eyes.... I felt uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributary emotion from me"" (15 - 17)[Daisy, after the birth of her daughter]: ""I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope she'll be a fool -- that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool."" (17)[Gatsby, introduction] ""Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Gatsby himself..."" (20)[Myrtle with Wilson vs Myrtle with Tom] ""...her personality had undergone a change. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her..."" (31)[Nick] ""I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life."" (35)[Gastby's parties] ""There was music from my neighbor's house through the summer nights. It his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests driving from the tower of his raft, or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and lost past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before... Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York -- every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves."" (39)[Gastby's parties] ""The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names... The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful world. The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the center of a group, and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light."" (40 - 41) conveys that sense of privilege, excitement and not knowing what you want... and that things are interchangeable, dispensable. [coming to Gatsby's parties]: ""Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby at all, with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission."" (41)[Nick at Gatsby's party]: ""I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment."" (42) [GATSBY] ""He smiled understandingly -- much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance it it, that you may come across four or five times in your life. It faced- or seemed to face- the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, as your best, you hoped to convey."" (48)[Jordan] ""Anyhow, he gives large parties,"" said Jordan, changing the subject with an urban distaste for the concrete. ""And I like large parties. They're so intimate. At small parties there isn't any privacy."" (49)[Nick about Jordan] ""I noticed that she wore her evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes -- there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings."" (50)[Nick, about New York City) ""I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines give to the restless eye,"" (56)[Nick] 'I wasn't actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity."" (57)""Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men..."" (57)[Nick about Jordan]: ""It made not difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply. (58)[Nick, about New York City]: ""The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world."" (68)[Gatsby and his dreams]: ""Daisy put her arm through is abruptly, but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one... There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams- not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what man will store up in his ghostly heart."" (93, 95)[Daisy, at Gatsby's party]: ""After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby's party there were romantic possibilities completely absent from her world.""[Tom, Daisy, Gatsby, Nick, Jordan lunch on that hot day]"" ""We had luncheon in the dining-roomm darkened too against the heat, and drank down nervous gayety with cold ale."" (118)""Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall."" (118)[Gatsby, about Daisy]: ""Her voice is full of money,"" he suddenly said.That was it. I'd never understood it before. It was full of money- that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals' song of it... High in a white palace the king's daughter, the golden girl... (120)[Nick, about Tom] ""and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well."" (124)[Nick, about Tom]: ""There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind."" (125)[Nick, about Jordan, in contrast with Gatsby]: ""But there was Jordan beside me, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age."" (135)""Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves..."" (150)[Nick to Gatsby] ""They're a rotten crowd,"" I shouted across the law. ""You're worth the whole damn bunch put together."" (154)""the incorruptible dream"" (154)the more you say it, the less real it becomes: ""... and some garrulous man telling over and over what had happened, until it became less and less real even to him and he could tell it no longer..."" (156)""If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream."" (161)[well-put]: ""When the butler brought back Wolfsheim's answer I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me against them all."" (165)[Nick, about Tom]: ""I couldn't forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy- they smashed things and creates and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was thet kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made...""

1078,Braydenfarr,"I rated this five stars because there is a history lesson about the 1920's.The great Gatsby is brilliant read. The Great Gatsby is your homie until you find out he's a bootlegger. It comments you with some of the most magnificent English ever published. Making it difficult to discuss the novel without the urge to stammer about its beauty. It would be evidence enough to argue that F. Scott Fitzgerald was superhuman, if it wasn't for the fact that we know he also wrote This Side of ParadiseDrugs, Alcohol, Murder "
1079,Kirsty,One of my favourite books of all time
1080,Jamie,"I read this book in high school and was very much kicking and screaming, and as such, I had no appreciation for it. The only thing I went into this book with was the knowledge that Daisy would die, and no one would care. Let me just say, I am so glad I read it again!I will be reading more of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novels, this book gave a lot of insight to the time, it's quite genius. It is neat, each character is obviously well thought out, Fitzgerald really had a handle on what people are like, not on the surface, but deeper. The novel is told through the eyes of Nick Carraway, who is a young Yale graduate. He is living off his father's money while he tries to figure himself out, so he is not on the outside, nor the inside of the world which he sees daily. He moves to New York to try to get his start, and ends up next door to Jay Gatsby, the eccentric millionare. Every Saturday, Gatsby throws a party, a come oggle at my money and my wondefulness party, or so you think at first, but as you get a deeper understanding, you realize that Jay Gatsby just wants someone to truly care for HIM as a person. In comes Daisy, the reason why Gatsby is so unhappy with life, Daisy and Gatsby had a fling, but though they love each other, Daisy married someone else, Tom Buchanan. Nick finds a way to get the two ex lovers to meet at his (Nick's) house. The two start up their romance again, despite the fact that she is married, and soon, her husband, Tom, finds out. In his anger, Tom reveals what the reader has suspected for a while, Gatsby's great fortune has come from illegal gambling and bootlegging (dun dun dun!) Gatsby and Daisy drive back to New York, but in Daisy's distressed state, she hits and kills a woman with her car. Gatsby takes the blame.George Wilson, the husband of the woman who died, finds out who it was, and since Gatsby had so heroically taken the blame, George kills Gatsby. Nick, who is one of the only ones who stuck by Gatsby, arranges a funeral for his friend, and then leaves New York, disgusted by the way people chose to live their lives so frivolously. This book is so much more than a story, now that I have looked at it and read it again, it's amazing how much Fitzgerald was able to get into people's minds. This book is literally a look into the life of people at that time. "

1082,Keelie Carrell,"The Great Gatsby Book Review“No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.” The Great Gatsby written by F. Scott Fitzgerald is in my opinion the greatest known classic of all time. The New York Times says, “It expresses one phase of the great grotesque spectacle of our American scene.” The story possesses love, deception, and life in what was then the all too short lived “American Dream” era. The book itself has won numerous awards including the Modern Library 100 Best Novels of the Century and The Novel 100: The 100 Greatest Novels of All Time. Fitzgerald’s obsession with what he considered the “Jazz Era” was fixed into not only stories like The Great Gatsby, but also in his other works such as, Tender is the Night, This Side of Paradise, and Tales of the Jazz Age. His modern style of writing not only exemplifies in details, but seems to personify every specific aspect of his forty-five novels and numerous other short stories. Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby out of inspiration from a house he lived across from. The beautiful white home he describes as Daisy and Tom’s in the story, in real life was built in 1902 by a New York World newspaper editor. The home owner, Herbert B. Swope would throw extravagant parties that would include famous celebrities such as Albert Einstein, Groucho Marx, and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, all while Fitzgerald would gaze upon in amazement in his own home from across the bay (MailOnline.com). The book is characterized in different genres including, romance and classic, but is an easy enough read to be included as a young adult book.The book was written and inspired while the roaring 20’s were in full swing. This was a time of hope and prosperity for Americans who had just gotten out of a World War and were enjoying a booming economy. Prohibition made people millionaires and brought on for high rates of organized crime. The book demonstrates the lack of morals people had and how heavily they relied on the materialistic parts of their lives. In the title itself it foreshadows one of the main characters names. Gatsby is a wealthy man who is known for his elaborate parties by all his neighbors. No one really knows him intimately yet they all call him and consider him “The Great Gatsby” because he was no stranger to the finer things in life, therefore making him “Great”. The preface itself, written by a guest author explains the point of view in which the story is being told and informs the reader that Nick, the narrator, is a trustworthy individual who is bombarded with sorting out the rumors and lies from the truth about this mysterious man called Gatsby. It also goes into more detail on Gatsby’s love for Daisy and just how much he truly cared for her, including a timeline of the events for the two. The book itself is organized in easy to read chapters that include foreshadows and flashbacks of Gatsby’s life so the reader gets a better feel for just how much work he put in to impress Daisy. On the book jacket itself it displays an old billboard with yellow eyes that is mentioned in the story. This is ironic because they seem to resemble the eyes of God watching and weeping over this grand city of sin. Some of the characters include Daisy, the wife of Tom Buchanan who is very materialistic and always looking for the better in life. She once dated Gatsby before he departed to fight in the Great War, but when he returned she was already married with a baby on the way. Tom, husband of Daisy, is very jealous of his lovely wife yet, ironically is having an affair with a Myrtle. Myrtle, at the end of the story is run over by Daisy in Gatsby’s car out of jealous rage, which Tom believes was by Gatsby’s hand and then later leads to Gatsby being shot in his pool by Tom. Nick, the narrator is a cousin of Daisy. He is very nonjudgmental character in the story and is sought out by all the others. He seems to feel sorry for Gatsby and tries to help him win Daisy over from Tom, although truly he thinks Gatsby is the greatest man alive and could have any woman he wanted. I believe he had kind of what is seen now as a modern day man crush on Gatsby. Gatsby’s character is portrayed as a well to do business man. He is known for extravagant parties he throws. It is later revealed that Gatsby is involved in illegal dealings probably with the bootlegging of alcohol. When Gatsby was a younger man he fell blindly in love with Daisy before he shipped off to fight in World War I. When he returned he expected her to have waited for him out of the great love he believed they shared, but found she was married. He refused to believe they hadn’t been so madly in love and forced himself to think she was only with Tom for the money. So before seeing Daisy again he went and made something of himself. He even changed his name and gained a reputation for the most happening person in town, all to impress his love. He then came to her cousin Nick for help to make sure everything went perfectly. When Daisy is confronted however, she admits to once loving Tom which breaks Gatsby’s heart. He realizes he has been in love with the Daisy who doesn’t exist anymore. I personally empathize with Gatsby because I know what it is like to love someone who isn’t the person they are today. You fall in love with the idea of them more than you have really fallen for that particular person. The theme for The Great Gatsby is the decline of the American dream. The characters contribute by showing that having it all wasn’t really what they wanted. Money and houses and parties are to be believed to be living the American dream but all along all he really wanted was to have his love and the stuff was just to impress her, just like what was going on in Fitzgerald’s own life with his wife Zelda. The author’s style is accessible to everyone making it a classic with every generation relating to the feeling of wanting what you can’t have even though you have so much now.Works CitedClark, EDWIN.

1083,Marzana Mutee,"Scott Fitzgerald’s, The Great Gatsby, took place in New York City during the 1920’s. The roaring 20’s was after WW1 and many individuals were celebrating because the war has finally ended. It was a major part in history and it has greatly changed the Western world both socially and politically. The novel captures the lives of the wealthy and how life was mostly about money, luxury, parties, love, and drugs. Fitzgerald shows how through characterization people are able to change because of money. Gatsby is a very rich man who’s carefree and kind towards others yet he receives nothing in return. He begins to throw massive parties and show off his luxurious life in hopes of having his true love come to him one day. Gatsby is unlike all the other selfish and greedy rich people in West Egg. For example at his parties he provides first class to all his guests even though he doesn't know them. He even provided a new dress for one of his guests who had ripped their dress at his party. He bought a mansion across the bay from his true love and goes through so much to be with her even though she’s married. Unlike Daisy, his true love, Gatsby isn't blinded by luxury and would do anything for her. He would treat her with kindness and love. When Gatsby left to war she needed someone to support her financially, so she married Tom. Unfortunately for Gatsby, Daisy is in love with her wealth and can't seem to let it go. Even though Gatsby is rich Daisy doesn't leave Tom; one of the main reasons being security. She found out that Gatsby had made his money illegally, so despite her love for Gatsby she needed to stay with someone whom she would receive security from. Readers are able to discern that the wealthy characters change their perspectives on people based on their money. "
1084,Kayla Cassumba,"The Great Gatsby was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald and originally published in 1925. Historically, the United States was recovering from World War 1 and they called it The Roaring 20s. During this time events like the Prohibition, bootlegging, and women's rights became more prominent in society. The Great Gatsby encompasses many of these aspects and portrays themes of identity, love, deceit and morality.Reading through the perspective of the narrator, Nick Carraway, we are able to challenging our mindsets and understanding the mindsets of the people we surround ourselves with. Nick’s foundation on being “inclined to reserve all judgments.” However this idea serves as a center of conflict throughout the reading of the book. An important quote that popped out to me was the following, “The loneliest moment in someone’s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.” This book definitely depicts this moment throughout every character and how it eventually affects the ones they love. The Great Gatsby is an engaging, descriptive and controversial book that will have your emotions on a roller-coaster ride. It really ends up have you reflect in your life and how you would react in the situations that occur during the book. In addition, there are two versions of The Great Gatsby that have come out in theaters. The one that was released in May 2013 has a pretty accurate portrayal of the book and captivating film. Overall, The Great Gatsby is a classic and everyone should read it at least once. "
1085,Sabrina,"I read this originally in the tenth grade. While I remembered liking it, I remembered almost nothing about it (minus the major themes and plot progression). I forgot how beautiful the writing is, and it is particularly nice to listen to on audiobook because you really get to savor the words.Just wonderful."
1086,Dannuel Saùl Delizo,"This book is the attestation that we are currently inhabiting an undoubtedly distinctive world. Way back in the Jazz age, life had been crucially tough and disheveled. The novel served as an antipode to the values and images that clean-cut Americans wanted to advance in the 1950s as a new procreation became the custodians of their lofty sovereignty. The Great Gatsby is not one of those graphic novels that would do the visualizations for you and all you have to do is process the colors and shapes your eyes scan. See? This book is like, out of all the curricular courses, Math. Everybody hates Mathematics because not everyone can comprehend and play with numbers. The Great Gatsby is a combination of numbers and letters that requires profound analysis, endless derivations and brilliant assumptions.Jay Gatsby, who was painfully wealthy, was nothing but a person who deserved answers. His life was an unsolved mathematical problem, a screaming voiceless creature and a penniless love martyr."
1087,Lacey Lordan,"I told my grandmother about my Great American Novel class and out first book we were going to be reading. “The Great Gatsby?” she replied. “Oh, I remember reading that he wore a white linen suit to impress the woman he loved. It’s a very good book. You’re going to like it.”	Wow, I thought. It must be really good if she remembers what he wore after so many years. ‘It’s a classic’ I’d always heard. Without ever hearing a synopsis or anything about the actual story line, I eagerly started to read with high expectations. This brilliantly written, wildly interesting story far exceeded my expectationsYou can not help but be drawn in by the array of characters. Nick Carraway, the narrator, is telling the story from his point of view. We find out everything when Nick does. Nick is the quiet cousin of Daisy Buchanan. The two live on opposite eggs of New York City: Nick on the “less fashionable” West and Daisy the extravagant East. Daisy is married to Tom Buchanan, a wealthy New Haven alumni with a mistress in the city, Myrtle. Myrtle Wilson’s husband owns an auto garage and that is the scene for a crucial and very interesting part of the novel. Their lives are seemingly great until we get hints that Daisy has a secret of her own. Then the story unfolds into a web of deceit and lies. Jay Gatsby, also known as “The Great Gatsby”, lives next door to Nick on the West Egg. What is so strange and the is the mystery of the book, is that Gatsby is incredibly wealthy and lives next door to Nick’s eighty dollars per month shack. Of all the wonderful, beautiful houses in the East Egg, Gatsby chooses to build this amazing home on the “poor” egg. How does Gatsby get all the money he has? Many people who come to his extravagant parties don’t even know Gatsby; much less know how he got so wealthy. The large, attention gathering parties Gatsby throws are another mystery. He has them regularly, but nobody knows why. The greatest mystery of all is that of the green light across the Sound behind Nick and Gatsby’s houses. What is it, and why does Gatsby stare at it every night?	Using descriptive words helps the reader get a better picture of what’s going on. F. Scott Fitzgerald brilliantly describes every scene perfectly. For example, “And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I hardly know…their house was elaborate, a cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial mansion overlooking the bay.”Not only do you get a sense of what the house looks like, you also are told what the weather is like. He doesn’t just leave it alone at “one evening” He makes you feel as though you are in that car on that “warm windy evening.” with him. Although, not short and to the point, detail is important. It’s like the A-1 to your T-bone. Sure you could eat the steak alone and it be ok, but the sauce adds flavor. Fitzgerald knows when to stop pouring the A-1. Too much detail can crowd the idea or point being made. He pours just enough to make it delicious and make you want another bite.	Fitzgerald makes the reader feel as if they’re right there standing with Nick in every single conversation and at every party. Personalities can be “judged” by a physical description. Describing Jordan Baker (Daisy’s friend) Fitzgerald captures her personality by merely telling of her physical position. “She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something in it which was quite likely to fall.”Jordan Baker is a little arrogant and thinks she is too good. She must always have her way, especially in a game of golf; a sport she is very good at but she cheats. The way each character is introduced and describes, makes them seem real.	The Great Gatsby is an amazing story with a little mystery and romance. Its style can’t be touched. The Great Gatsby is indeed a classic story and a Great American Novel. Once you think you have the story figured out, it changes and you’re wrong. The book is filled with drama, but not catty, girlie drama. Males as well as females will enjoy this book. Even though through it all, love is a predominant theme in The Great Gatsby. This book is filled with passion, lust, jealousy, overindulgence, deceit, and yes, even a murder or two. With a change of clothes and manner of speaking this story could’ve happened during any time period since this book was written. It is still relevant and imagine it always will be. You will not want to put this book down. It is timeless. I recommend The Great Gatsby to everyone. Whoever reads this book will remember it for the rest of their life. My grandmother is proof of that. It was written in a classic era with classic style, and that is why it will always be remembered as a Great American Novel."
1088,Julia Munoz," The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a book that is full of love, romance , and most of all money. When our teacher told us that we had to read the book for our classroom , I actually thought to myself it was going to be another boring book that we always read for English class. But I was wrong. Its one of the most interesting books I’ve read, In every page you turn of the book , it leaves you hanging. There was parts of the story that were boring but somehow made the story better. The Great Gatsby is a book that leaves you anticipating. In The Great Gatsby , Jay Gatsby is one of the key characters, whose story represents “rags to riches”. He was a man who was once in love with a young woman named Daisy. Daisy Buchanan is married to a man , Tom Buchanan, who’s rich and arrogant , and thinks hes better than anybody else. Nick Carraway, the narrator of the story is somehow the cousin of Daisy Buchanan. Somehow all of the characters are connected in some ways. These top four characters are all involved in lies that make the book , one of the best books written. Honestly I think that teachers should continue showing this book to their students , I believe that somehow the events that took place in the story can have a huge effect on how “us” the kids of this generations and many more , live their life. It shows how sometimes money can take over your life and be your priority at some points. The author believes that money overpowers love in many ways. If you find it interesting you should go to your closets library and check out, you will thank me late."
1089,Arun Kumar,"It was not the plot of the story that makes the book interesting. The way Scott pens down the story is exceptional. The prose reflects satire as it does in ""This Side of the Paradise"". I understand the author was fed up of the society and wanted it to change - after reading ""This Side of Paradise"" and ""The Beautiful and The Damned"" by Scott. His books and lectures are indicative of the way Scott felt about the then society.In itself, ""The Great Gatsby"" is a good read that will keep you hooked to the book - as Scott adds a layer of mystery to the story that may not have been as interesting if any other author has written it. Actually, I do not know what to say about this particular book. All I can say is read it, along with other works of F Scott to understand the real story. That is, if you read other works of Scott and come back to this book later, you will see the entire book in another light."
1090,Gene R.,"I decided to use the extra two months of my vacation digging into the classic works of literature. I have no idea where to start so I picked this out on a whim, and I'm glad I did. F.Scott Fitzgerald was a brave and truthful author, with the utmost precision and cynicism in describing the grim and shallow times of the high-living lifestyle during the Jazz Age. Nick Carroway was a wallflower, having to be both within and without the crazy clamorous life of the socially mighty. He was a witness not only to the ease and pleasant luxury of living the American dream but also to the heartbreaking torture of collapsing from one. Overcoming the penniless and beggarly life of James Gatz, Jay Gatsby indulged with the highest pleasure of upscale living and the wildly overwhelming repute that came with it but as smoothly as he glides among the glamorous exploits in his life, in the end and quite ironically, his limitless desire became his most tremendous downfall. Simply put, it shows the greatest and boldest rise and fall to and from the ambitious spectacle of materialistic and human endeavor."
1091,Chitra Nair,"The Great Gatsby is a very well written American Classic. I love the jazzy vibe that the book exudes at first and the darker undertones. I must confess that I got this book because of my Leonardo DiCaprio obsession. But it was really worth it. I loved all the characters and how real they seemed. My heart broke to pieces when I read about Gatsby's death. It seemed so cruel that Gatsby's parties were attended by so many people and hardly anyone, except Nick and a few others, attended his funeral. Jay Gatsby, the poor fellow, I really felt so sorry for him. How he cared so much for his beloved and his hopeless dream... It really broke my heart. I really felt like I could strangle Daisy Buchanan. After reading the entire book, I felt that Daisy was the real villain of the whole book. (that's my view). Daisy is extremely superficial and as Nick says (and I quote), ""careless"". We never really got to know her true intentions, whether she truly loved Gatsby or her extramarital affair with Jay was just a way to spite Tom. As for Nick, I really liked him. Even though the entire story was focused on Gatsby, Nick still managed to be a dominant character. I liked it that Fitzgerald didn't push him in the background. Tom, Tom, Tom. I hated that —I don't even have an appropriate expletive to describe his filthiness. He's a douche bag and I hated him a lot. Here he goes about, having an affair with Myrtle and when his own wife has an affair, he can't really take it. He's proud, he's rude, and is extremely masochistic. All in all, I liked this story a lot and I would recommend it to anyone who loves reading about the 1920's America before the Great Depression. I would also recommend it to those who love romance a lot. "
1092,J,"When I read Gatsby in high school and again in college it was always a what's-the-big-deal sort of book for me. But this time, for whatever reason, I was enthralled from the first page. Guess I understand when I'm older.There is remarkable economy in the text - so much is conveyed in so few words. The characters, their motivations, their actions are all expressed with remarkable clarity and concision. Re-read the death scenes and see if you remember there being more to it than there is.I think back on reading this in school with frustration. The amount of time spent contemplating green lights and the eyes of T.J. Eckleburg - every now and again I heard echoes of teachers' voices when I'd read a sentence that they asked us to ponder, but it's hard to see now what significance they thought was being signified. Great, Gatsby's car is bold and gold and the Buchanan's is dark and staid, new money v. old. This is not a detail worth ruminating over. How much more there is here to see, and how many potentially serious students of literature are turned off when even this most accessible novel is turned into mere fodder for quizzes on symbolism."
1093,Jay Wexler,"Having re-read this again for the who knows how manieth time, I once again find myself disagreeing with the 36,509 people who have given it a one star rating on this website."
1094,Vivien Fung,"Lovely, eloquent, a little bit sexy in a restrained, delicate way. Full of elegantly expressed ideas and observations - my favourite ones, the ones that seem obvious in exactly the way the author expressed it once you've read their words. Barring the great writing, this period of time also makes for fascinating reading!Favourite quotes: ""A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: 'There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and the tired.""""Her voice is full of money.""""He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.""""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money of their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.""""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning-- So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
1095,Abbyb1,"Possibly one of my most favourite books ever! There are so many reasons why this book has moved me. In the end, I suppose I respond to how some people just aren't worth the time and effort they demand. It's a lesson I've had to learn in my own life and one which this novel demonstrates adeptly. Beyond that, it's just a marvellous book. This is one I reread often."
1096,Harry,"This book is fantastic, personally one of my facorite books of all time. The story is sad but teaches a lot about how people treat eachother and what they value most in life. F Scott Fitzgerald wrote this book with passion and diction that can only be described as beautiful. The book is deep yet easy to follow. The novel makes the reader question love and hte value of loved ones. The book also shows hope and determination. The book is filled with different emotions and lessons that are all very important and interesting. This is a very popular novel and most likely all students probably will end up reading it. But if you never have read it I would completely recommend it or at least see the movie (the 2013 Leo version). "
1097,Khuyen,The American dream.. i get goosebumps whenever i read the ending again.
1098,Erika Meidenbauer,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a book about a self-made rich man who loves a married woman during the Roaring '20s. Gatsby was in love with Daisy when WWI began, and they were seperated. Daisy then married Tom Bucchan, and they moved to the West Egg of NYC. Gatsby moved directly across the bay from them, and could see the lights on the end of thier dock at night. The romance between the two is told frankly, with all the charm of the decade. The love story is told from the eyes of Gatsby's neighbor, Nick Carroway, who is Daisy's 2nd cousin once removed.I liked the simple way Fitzgerald showed human nature. Tom and Myrtle couldn't stand who they were married too, but didn't want to divorce because that would change thier 'stable' marriages. Gatsby thought he could repeat the past, as most lost lovers often wish. The frankness in the writing was excellent as well, and I could get a sense of the people and their relationships.I did not like the ending at all, it took me a few paragraphs to realize Gatsby died. I think that was due to the way it was written (in the 1920's) so that was difficult to understand. I also thought that Miss Jordan was somewhat cruel to Nick throughout the book, and I really didn't like that.Overall, The Great Gatsby was an intricate love story and I was captivated fromt the moment I began. The reason I began was because of the movie that's coming out on May 10th 2013, but I will be re-reading it for the subtly themes on human nature. I would recomend this to anyone who likes a good romance or philophosy."

1100,Virginia Jacobs,"What did I think of The Great Gatsby? When I finished reading it, I was left with a swirl of emotions in my gut. I don't feel like I know quite enough about Gatsby to consider him ""great,"" but what was revealed to the reader definitely made him interesting.One line in particular struck me as the defining theme of the story: But there was Jordan beside me, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age.""Daisy, in my opinion, isn't worth the effort Gatsby puts into actions to impress her, but then again, I don't think a man ever fell in love with me because of my voice, which is apparently the only mesmerizing thing about her. Fitzgerald tells us that Daisy is incredible, but he doesn't show us how. Nick seems like a reasonable guy, but even he is a bit prejudiced towards Daisy. I was saddened at the end of the story, and feeling a sort of injustice, but at the same time, I was left wondering, what happened next, and what did Gatsby really do? Who was he, really? And I was frustrated, too, because Tom seemed like a regular jerk, and he got away with it, but jerks so often do, don't they?On a more upbeat note, Fitzgerald's use of language never ceases to amaze me, and I wonder if I ever tried to write like that, would it sound sincere, or would it sound like I had strung bits and pieces of language of truly great writers together in a meager attempt to come up with something new. If nothing else, Fitzgerald makes me think."
1101,Jana Eichhorn,"Beautifully written book with language so rich and descriptive that it's like honey on your tongue. Everyone should read this book once in their lives. It is, as so many have called it, The Great American Novel.--2015 re-read--My feelings are the same. I love this book so much. "
1102,Beth,"The Short: If you enjoy Fitzgerald's style, are interested in the 1920s, it's on your list of American classics, or you just want a luscious yet meaningful read full of memorable characterization (though perhaps not always so admirable characters), read it.The Long: Gatsby remains as one of those books that everyone has already said everything about. Therefore, I elect to share my own personal experiences with reading this novel, instead of attempting to analyze the symbolism or style or anything of the sort. At the near close of my 10th grade year, I attended a band concert in which my sister was performing. The jazz band, opening the show, instilled in me the urge to read something from the 20s -- and the following afternoon I picked up The Great Gatsby from the Fitzgerald shelf of our local library. I read the book in two days. Interestingly enough I had never previously been one to find much interest in the time period, but in this weekend reading spree I had unexpectedly and happily discovered one who would take a place among my most beloved writers, and without a doubt serve as my favorite American author. The main appeal the book had for me was the enthralling characterization. I remember sitting in the car, eagerly scouring the pages to find little gems of gorgeous prose (I've always been partial to the line ""in his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars""). Fitzgerald has a way of vividly, almost quirkily describing people in a strange, unique, and yet remarkably fitting manner. One may despise the colorful individuals bringing the hypocrisy, surface glamor, and underlying emptiness of Roarin' 20's Long Island to life, but nevertheless from the careless Daisy to the doomed Gatsby they transcend any similar characters that existed before.Fitzgerald achieved a work worthy of classic status: not only does the novel (maybe more of a novella) demonstrate a masterful, vibrant style so different from other writers of the time, but it also detailed a fascinating age in American history -- a source of literary inspiration and a backdrop for a history lesson all in one.I did read the book a second time about a year later, in this instance for school. I was glad to read it again, and hear what my peers thought of it. By this point I had read more works by Fitzgerald, but I still appreciated what this book has done for the literary world and for me. Ultimately, Gatsby commands many meanings. Whether its the green light of the American dream or that thrilling last paragraph driven by ""boats beating against the current,"" I love this book down to the original artwork on the cover. I can turn to any page and immediately smile, and the ending is a favorite to recite. Gatsby is great. "
1103,Miguel Cisneros,"This is a great book to read it may be a little challenging, but if you are up for it read it. You are going to like this book and this is why: in this story told by Nick (Daisy's cousin) is telling of the life of everyone. He goes to Daisy's house and meets Tom (Daisy's husband) and when he got there Daisy, Tom, and Nick went outside the house Tom gets a phone call (from his mistress). Daisy and Tom start to argue and Nick feels awkward of been their. Later in the story he tells how he got to meet Gatsby. Nick lives in west egg Gatsby too. Gatsby had parties everyday and everyone was invited if they knew that their was a party going on or if they were passing by they would go to the party. One day a servant from Gatsby goes to Nick's house and tells him that Gatsby is inviting him to his party. Nick goes to the party and he didn't knew anybody in the party and he said to himself that out of all of the people in the party he was the only one that was actually invited to go. The only person that Nick knew was Jordan (friend) and they go to this room with a lot of books and they meet this guy their and Nick says that he hasn't even meet Gatsby in the party and the guy tells him that he is Gatsby they start talking about war.One of the things that Nick will find out is that Tom has a mistress and that he will meet her later on. Tom takes Nick with George and Myrtles comes down and sees Tom with Nick and Myrtle tells George to get some chairs so Tom will tell her something will he is distracted. Tom tell her to go next to the train. Tom and Nick go and get Myrtle and she sees this guy selling some dogs and she wanted one so Tom buys her a dog. Later they get to the front of her apartment building and Nick didn't want to got inside, but Tom told him that if doesn't that he will hurt Myrtle. When Nick was inside he sees Tom and Myrtle together later Catherine goes up to Nick and tell him in a low voice “...She’s a Catholic, and they don’t believe in divorce.” Daisy was not a Catholic...” Nick knew that Daisy wasn't Catholic and that Tom lied to them so that he wouldn't divorce Daisy to be with Myrtle because he loves Daisy, but he loves Myrtle more than Daisy.One day when everyone were gathered Daisy wanted to go to the city, but Tom didn't want to go. Daisy and Gatsby were talking and Tom was getting frustrated and he got up and say to Daisy let’s go to the city and she said that they were going to smoke some cigarettes. Then they all go outside and Tom wants to drive Gatsby’s car and he starts to make fun of Gatsby’s car and says it’s a circus wagon. Tom tells Daisy to go with him in the circus wagon, but Daisy say’s that she wants to ride with Gatsby in Tom’s car. Nick tells Tom to stop to get some gas because they didn't have enough gas to come back from the city. George looks at the car and Tom say “I bought it last week” and he tells George if he would want to buy it, but George tells him that he would rather want the other car. Myrtle was up stairs and looks out the window and sees Tom, Nick, and Jordan, but she thought that she was Daisy because they kind of look the same from far away.when Daisy and Gatsby were coming back from the city. Daisy was driving the car and Gatsby was in the passenger seat going to Daisy's house. Myrtle was running like crazy outside of the mechanic shop Daisy lost control of the car and Gatsby wanted to get the control of the car, but couldn't and run’s over Myrtle and kills her. Tom and Nick later pass through there and saw cops outside of the mechanic shop and he gets out to see what happens. Tom sees Myrtle on the ground dead he goes with George and a cop tells Tom what is he doing and he tells him that he is a friend of George. The cops start to ask some questions and Tom hears that the car that killed Myrtle was yellow and Tom knew it was Gatsby's car and he tells George that the car wasn't his it was Gatsby’s and that he was only driving it to go to the city. George went to Gatsby's house and shoot Gatsby."

1106,Iida,"""We all believe in that green light that has long eluded us, that if we can only 'run faster, stretch our arms farther... and then one fine morning-' And still the foul dust trails in the wake of those dreams."" - John Green on ""The Great Gatsby""I'm not going to try to go around in circles saying this after a pretentious review that will hopefully make me look smart, so I'm just going to be honest and foolish and say the one thing that is honest and foolish; This is one of the best books I have ever read.""The Great Gatsby"" is filled with great metaphors (The reunion of Gatsby and Daisy, The eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg, The green light across the bay.) and with people, who are not all likable, because they do not need to be. The Great Gatsby wouldn't be the book that we know, love, teach and are taught about, if F. Scott Fitzgerald had just wanted us to like all the characters. That is not how literature is made.That is why Gatsby turned out all-right. The thing that preyed on him- his dream, his yearning of lost innocence and love, only lead him to find corruption and violence. We cannot change the past no more than we can shape the future as we exactly want it to be. "
1107,Aliyah,"One of the things I love most about this book is that it is told from the point of view of an honest man. Nick Carraway does not exactly fit into the extravagant lifestyle of his companions.. He serves as a medium for Fitzgerald's social commentary on the Jazz Age. The book's not about how ""great"" Gatsby is. In fact it tells you more about how he isn't so great.. (view spoiler)[How he can't face reality or let go of the past. How he can't truly even be himself! He has to have his image of wealth to have the woman he wants and that isn't even enough for her! (hide spoiler)] The book is not a romantic vision of the Twenties as so many readers think. Rather, it is a more honest depiction and that is why I admire the honesty of the narrator so much.But there's more to him than his honesty that I like. See, he knows that Daisy and Gatsby are both reckless people. But he shows us that just because someone is reckless and shallow, it doesn't mean that you can't find something to admire about them. He was a good friend to both of them even though they caused more harm than good, and I thought that was very honorable of him.As I've always said, I'm not a fan of romance as a genre or a theme. I LOVE that this isn't a love story. I believe it just contains a lot of fundamental truths about relationships and human nature that everyone should ponder, and that the place where the author chose to expose those truths in his own words happened to be a failed romance in an indifferent age.This book should definitely be read once. Perhaps even twice if you didn't grasp the full beauty of Fitzgerald's words in high school. I mean he may have had a lot of problems in his life that caused him to do some undesirable things, but the fact of the matter is that he is probably one of the most eloquent writers of the 20th century. The man could write!"
1108,Gem,"I Rated This 9.2/10 My Thoughts: Fitzgerald absorbed me in this book from the onset with his stunning use of language and description. I found that the settings and characters came to true life inside my head, and as the action subtly whipped up from the pages, I couldn't put it down. It's one of those classic books that looks like it is going to be hard to read; to be all about the language and the style of prose - but The Great Gatsby had a lot more to it than that. It can be enjoyed (or not) on many different levels. As I purely and simply take pleasure from my reading books these days (and don't do the analytical reading of my college years), I am reviewing this based solely on my enjoyment of it - and I'm not going to dive into other aspects of the text.It's like a 20s soap opera from start to centre, and then a tragic film towards the conclusion. Very easy to read and very quick. I loved Gatsby as a character along with all of his flaws, and the style in which Fitzgerald writes (through Nick Carraway's eyes) means that we can really get a rounded view of him and his view on the other characters - I took from it his strong feelings towards Gatsby above everything else. The finale of the book is hard-hitting and involving, although I had twigged what was going to happen before it actually did. I understand that a lot of people have suggested that the characters are not realistic - that their actions and dialogue are over-bearing - however, I like the exaggeration of Daisy's hysteria, of Gatsby's romantic obsession and Tom's perceived authority and deception. I like that Nick Carraway seems like a very normal person in comparison to the rest - in a sense, that he can be trusted to narrate the story to us; but is he really telling it as it is, or does he have rose-tinted specs on too? Is he manipulating the way that he describes the whole tale to us? Is he exaggerating the characters himself? It actually comes across as being very clever to me. One thing that did irritate me (every rose has thorns), was the over-use of metaphoric language near the beginning of the book. It overwhelmed me for quite a few pages, and although it was very good, there is such a saying as ""too much of a good thing"". I was very much surprised by this book. I didn't expect to find myself absorbed by it. Theme: 4/5Exaggerated post-war characters that love to spend a bit of money, have a good time and enjoy a bit of scandal. Can't be bad.Plot: 4/5My only concern was that I had predicted the ending. It didn't ruin the effect of it for me though. Characters: 5/5The characters, for me, where perfect for their roles, particularly Nick as a narrator. Setting: 5/5Mansions, motorcars, pools and parties set in the 20's. Perfect. Style: 5/5Despite the overload of metaphorical language near the beginning, I loved it. Overall: 9.2/10Recommendation: I think that if you haven't already read it, then you should. It's that 'Great American Novel' that causes controversy. To be enjoyed, or not - even if it is simply to form your own opinion of it."
1109,Chlo Johnson,"The Great Gadsby is a hugely known classic about a man who longs for love on a island close to NYC. The story is told by Gadsby's neighbor Nick. Let me just say first however is how in my life I probably will never be able to hear the phrase 'old sport' used without crying ever again. Gadsby's life has been consumed by his love for an old friend Daisy who is already married to a man named Tom. He has become very rich in order to try and impress her. Then nit only that, but he then proceeds to spreads his insanity to Nick. Nick first Nick doesn't like this idea but soon helps and even looks up to him a bit. Also also does not take fondly on how Tom cheats on Daisy. The whole time you also don't know whether Gadsby is doing anything illegal to gain quick riches. Some readers say that he sold drugs to get money. But based on my knowledge of that period, back then most alcohol was contraband. In which I believe it was that he sold, not drugs.In the end after Daisy goes to him but returns to Tom. Thereby making depressing Gadsby severely. During a swim in his pool he is then gunned down by another character who Tom told him Gadsby had murdered his wife. Signaling the most poetic part of the book. Poor lonely Gadsby had bought all his friends. So since it had been his funeral not his extravagant parties no one but his father, the Owl eyed man, and Nick came. He tried so hard. Working and trying to become rich all to impress Daisy. When you think about it if he hadn't been killed, Gadsby would of remained having a miserable existence. The empty mansion representing his heart. Feeling on top of the world at its full. But alone and dull at it's empty..."
1110,Carolyn Nika,"F. Scott Fitzgerald's purpose for writing The Great Gatsby was to entertain readers with a fictional story portraying how different societies can all fit together into one big puzzle. This story was told from the first person view of a character named Nick Carraway. Nick has recently moved from Minnesota to an area of New York known as the West Egg to learn about the bond business. The West Egg is a not so popular area of town where the ""new rich"" who do not have very many connections and lack elegance and taste typically live. On the contrary, the East Egg of town is home to the established upper class. Unlike many in the West Egg, Nick has many connections to the upper class, so throughout the story, he unveils many secret connections. Fitzgerald wrote this novel for an audience that loves the thrill of life in the city. His writing also, in a way, pokes fun at this lifestyle.One major theme of this book is the superficiality among the upper class. People from both the East Egg and the West Egg, where Jay Gatsby lives, attend his parties because they are very fun and extravagant. All the while, no one even takes the time to find out who Gatsby is, let alone get to know him. Everyone is too caught up in the glitz and the glamour. Also, characters such as Tom, Myrtle, and Daisy lack the decency to be faithful to their spouses. They are so used to money being able to ease their troubles that they never take into consideration how their actions could hurt others. Daisy says, ""I hope she'll be a fool- that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool"" (Fitzgerald 46). This is a prime example of how the upper class does not value intelligent women. According to Daisy, the best thing a girl can be is basically arm candy for the men, not even worrying about real emotions. This novel is a narration. It is very important that Nick is the narrator because he is simply an outside source looking in on all the events that occur. Even though he is in the midst of all the action and has a first person view of it all, he is barely involved. He states at the beginning of the story that he is ""inclined to reserve all judgement"" meaning that he has no prior knowledge of the relationships between people so he cannot make assumptions any more than we can, as readers. The Great Gatsby was exceptionally interesting and involved. I thoroughly enjoyed making connections with new information I was being presented with, such as how Nick had known Gatsby previously before being introduced at one of his parties. At times, the storyline became a little confusing, but previously seeing the movie helped me understand everything a little better. I think that Fitzgerald made an very good decision to make Nick the narrator so that opinions were mostly left for the reader to make on their own. I appreciated how the story ended with definitiveness and not much left to the imagination. This story was very unique to anything else I have ever read, therefore I have nothing to compare it to."
1111,Katherine Kelly,"Sort of bummed I didn't get to read this book in school, it definitely ranks as one of my favorites for a ""classic."" Lots of great quotables in there - and descriptions of people, attitudes, places, etc that paint such a vivid picture of the truth of those things...just really truly enjoyable. Glad I finally got around to it!"
1112,Alison,"What struck me on this, my third or fourth read, was the effortlessly precise language, the beautiful lyricism. What a perfect book, if there ever was."
1113,Samantha,"What some would call a ""slice of life"" story, TGG allows us to peer into the humble insights of Nick Carraway and his extravagant experience of living next to a mysterious yet enigmatic man by the name of Gatsby during the early 1920s.This book surprised me by actually being funny and making me laugh quite a few times, I was glad I made it my first visit of classic literature- or return visit, seeing as I read it in high school. But that hardly counts because I was not yet of the mind to enjoy the subtle humour or nuances of Fitzgerald's commentary. I enjoyed the peek into the life of the ridiculously wealthy, especially that of those living during the prohibition era when alcohol should have been absent in every day life but, of course, was as abundant as the ocean's waves that lapped the sands of Gatsby's private beach. Even the first death we encounter, as gruesome as it is, has a poeticness about it. I outwardly cringed at the description and felt for the characters involved. Fitzgerald even managed to get me to care about Michaelis, a Greek man we barely know but his entire character and personality is bared to us in those moments following a tragic incident. I almost wonder why, when Andy Kaufman began reading from The Great Gatsby during an act, that the audience groaned and booed. Sure, they were expecting comedy, but what Kaufman wanted to deliver would have been just as entertaining."
1114,Elisamatt,"I've read this book two or three times and each time discover something else about it. The first time I read it, I had the idea that Daisy was an innocent who was captured by the wrong man and that what Daisy and Gatsby had was true love. Wrong. I don't want to give away too much because this book is so good, you really need to see what you can make of it yourself. But suffice it to say that Daisy is no innocent, Gatsby is no knight in shining armor and Tom may be better than he looks. Poor Nick, the narrator slowly gets it, too, and he has to move away from the scene of such misery."
1115,Brian Yahn,"Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan are two of the most memorable characters in literature. F. Scott Fitzgerald weaves them tragically together in this perfectly plotted masterpiece.Every scene is perfect, from the grandest party ever recorded, to the most tense fight ever written, to the most perfectly dark twisted affair of all time, to the most pathetically sad funeral imaginable.When people say this is the best book ever written, they're not kidding. It's so good that almost daily I wish I could experience this for the first time again."
1116,Becca,"I actually lost sleep the other night laying in bed pondering on the many geniuses of The Great Gatsby. I was thinking about how every time I read it I'm convinced for about a month that it's the great novel ever written: fascinating story, beautiful writing, profound meaning; it's all there. But the other night what kept me awake was that I was contemplating on whether this is a moral novel. Anyone who's read it knows it deals with adultery, illegal activities, murders, all kinds of things that are considered immoral by probably most people. So why is it that I think of The Great Gatsby as a profoundly moral novel? Why am I willing to defend its goodness to my last breath? When the hero and heroine are adulterers--one is a liar; the other unforgiveably weak. So why do I love them? I finally decided that I love them because Nick, our beloved narrator, loves them as well. He never once justifies their actions, or paints their actions a different color to make them look less offensive. What these people and their friends are doing is decidedly wrong. Nick simply tells us about them without judging them too harshly so we can learn from them. He shows us all their beauty and wonder but also points out the dark side of their world. I love Jay Gatsby because of the awe he inspires. I love being caught up in the mystery surrounding him. When the novel is over and mystery is revealed, I love him still because we find a man who actually tried to live his life according to some discipline; his love for Daisy consumed him and eventually led him to his ruin. "
1117,Arushi,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a classic, a book you must read. Yet, I had happily not read it till now. In fact this is the 1020th book that I have read. My loss. The story has an ethereal quality to it, an essence of moving from one incident to another, regardless of the time lapse between them, if they are relevant to each other. The author was not writing a novel, he is telling a story as he would have if I had been sitting in front of him. No, as if I had been sitting in front of Nick Carraway as he told me about his neighbor on the East coast. His friend perhaps. A man who people only knew through stories and gossip. A man called Jay Gatsby. For the first 22 pages I wondered what was going on. I wanted to know where we were heading with this. But once Gatsby entered, all I wanted to do was know more about him. To understand who he was, where had he come from, how he had become the person that he was. His motivations, his desires, everything. There is a strange magnetism in that man, in his madness, his passion for something almost unattainable. Nick Carraway tells the story in a way that you cannot help but be fascinated by this man, whom even the narrator suspects. I will not really talk about the story. Read the book or wait a while and watch the movie. I don't wish to give away any spoilers but the book is brilliant. As for the movie, I wanted to read The Great Gatsby from the moment I saw the trailer for the movie. It was not just the video but the song, Love is Blindness, that captivated me. It was only after I had read the book that I realized just how apt that song truly is. Love is indeed blindness. I wish Gatsby was not blind, but then he would not be Gatsby. "
1118,McKenzie,"This was my third time reading The Great Gatsby - I first read it in 2003 in high school, and again in 2010 after graduating with my English Literary Studies degree. Each time I have approached it from a different mentality, and each time I find something new to savor and ponder after finishing. Though I have yet to read Tender is the Night, I think The Great Gatsby stands out from Fitzgerald's other novels This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and Damned because he removed himself from an autobiographical position and truly told a story. There is tension in Gatsby, there is purpose and climax and meaning, rather than a narrative mishmash of 1920s culture, drinking, and longing for unattainable women. Yes, those last three things feature prominently in Gatsby, but something ineffable about Fitzgerald's narrative elevates this novel to greatness, above those other works. For those who read The Great Gatsby in high school and hated it due to the overt symbolism, give it another chance. For me, this is The Great American Novel. "
1119,Hind,"	“There are all kinds of love, in this world but never the same love, twice.” This classic novel is filled with love and hatred. It’s filled with ups and downs, and it’s filled with the life of the 1920s. F. Scott Fitzgerald made sure to move people’s emotions throughout the book whether it’s a breathtaking or a heartbreaking movement. His style of writing includes challenging vocabulary, personification, imagery, and a lot of one’s point of view. Throughout the novel, Nick Carraway, the narrator, seems to be the only one who was neutral about his feelings and the only one who kept it together during the chaotic environment. In my own opinion, this book brings out a side of one’s imagination that one didn’t know about in the first place since it opens up secrets of the 1920s. Furthermore, Jay Gatsby is a famous wealthy man who no one really knows much about. Everyone makes up rumours about him, ranging from him killing another man, to being a German spy, and even to being a great war hero. It is very interesting how someone could be so well known yet so unknown. 	Later on in the novel, Fitzgerald mentions that Gatsby bought his mansion right in front of Daisy’s, the love of his life, which I found very beautiful, because despite all the years they hadn’t seen each other, he still had as much love for her as he did when they were together. Fitzgerald also includes a green light that always goes on at night and shines right in front of Gatsby’s deck. The green light would be a symbol for regret because in the story he tries reaching out for it, which could mean that he regrets losing her due to his low class and lack of money. Additionally, Gatsby’s parties were the parties of the year, or maybe even the century. The 1920s is known as the “Roaring Twenties,” because it was the time of technological advances, parties, and large cities that never sleep. He threw all of these parties in hope that one day she would read about them and walk in. That is rare. I love how he never gave up. Not to mention that, in “The Great Gatsby”, the author makes it clear that the lifestyle was extremely different from how it is now, which makes us go back in time and witness their love, their fun, their hate, and most importantly, their partying. 	“Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.” This quote shows that life is like a roller coaster with high ups, low downs, and boring stability. However, as soon as one drops down to a low, as bad as they will feel, the roller coaster will take them back up to scare them one more time. Furthermore, nothing lasts forever. Gatsby waited for a change as Daisy got married to another man, Tom, which shows that nothing is certain, and nothing stays for a lifetime. Confirming my point is the fact that even the second time they got together during her marriage, it didn’t last. She left with Tom rather than staying with Gatsby, her true love. I am not a big fan of that part of the novel because one should not stay with someone they do not care strongly about, and leave the person who they actually have feelings for."
1120,Keldwin Mercedes,"The Great Gatsby is about a man, Jay Gatsby, formerly James Gatz, who strives to become a whole new person. Throughout the whole novel, the reader is in awe, wondering who The Great Gatsby really is because nobody really knows him. There are several rumors floating about him and nobody seems to be feeding narrator Nick Carraway the truth about someone he is so close to. The pages start to get thinner and the truth is starting to get revealed when Nick finds out that Gatsby is really Gatz, and when he finds out what Gatsby's business really was. The book is mysterious in many ways, being that we don't find out until the end what Gatsby is doing to get his money, what his real name is, and what the motive for some if not all of his actions were. He, Jay Gatsby did all of this to get Daisy Buchanan, to fall in love with him. In any work of literature, you'll find that there are problems that people probably the main characters, need to overcome and in this case, Gatsby needs to resolve his issue of being away from Daisy because of her husband Tom. The Great Gatsby is a mysterious, scary and suspense filled book."
1121,Monica,"I really enjoyed reading the Great Gatsby. I remember reading it for my English a-level a few years back and I remember really enjoying it. Recently I read it for the first time in 5 years and I found it really enchanting. Sure some of the language and descriptions are quite complex to make sense of, but on the whole it was easy to read and in parts was beautifully written. I smiled whenever I remembered the familiar quotes. I love that this novel is set in the roaring twenties, it makes it seem much more colourful and brings it to life. I think that the Great Gatsby is one of the best stories of all time and is a story that you can relate to and sympathize with.The Great Gatsby is about a mysterious billionaire called Jay Gatsby who wants what money can't buy, the love of his life Daisy. He forms a close friendship with his neighbour and narrator of the story, Nick Carraway, Daisy's cousin who is accepted into her wealthy inner circle, but yet still an outsider and an observer.I really thought that Nick was a likeable and genuine character. Gatsby is probably my favourite character of all time; he is my idea of a perfect man. Gatsby although foolish and deluded is kind, genuine and full of warmth. Many people dislike the book because of the shallow and unlike able characters, but personally I don't think that unlike-able characters make a bad book. Although Daisy, Jordan and Tom are unlike able, they are dis-likeable for a reason. They represent everything that is wrong with society and unfortunately there are many people like them who I have had the misfortune to encounter; shallow, obsessed with money and status and deeply selfish. These people usually belong to their own inner circle and they rarely let anybody who isn't their own kind in.The Great Gatsby is also relevant to those who have experience unrequited love. You can still apply the Great Gatsby to a modern society in so many ways. There's so much to think and talk about from this book. The story really hits you and gets you emotionally involved. I love it when the book has the power to do that! I'm obsessed with the Great Gatsby. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a great story teller and has inspired me and my writing ideas. Although some of the language and phrases were difficult to interpret I understand that this was written in a different time, but unlike most classics 80-85% of the time, it was easy to follow and understand. The Great Gatsby is generally beautifully written and I could easily quote a lot of it. I love this book!Grade: A "
1122,Jake,"This is one of many books I was assigned in high school. I remember liking it. I am guessing that I would get much more out of it now with college under my belt. One passage from the novel has always stuck with me, in large part because of the way my high school English teacher singled it out. Tom breaks the nose of his mistress at a party. Just after reading this section in class, my English teacher stopped our reading. He then said in effect, “Notice how casually this plays. Notice how a woman being hit is allowed to happen and everyone just moves on. What does that say about the social climate of the time?” This moment, more than any other in high school, taught me the value of pausing when I read—pausing to consider moments of significance. When you pause in masterpieces like The Great Gatsby, you stand to learn valuable lessons."
1123,Jess,"I love Fitzgerald's work! I did a report on the roaring 20's in my history class during my sophomore year of high school and this book popped up. I was curious from that point on and drawn to the life that people lived during this time so you can very well imagine my excitement when it was assigned in my English class the next year. Likewise, you can imagine how the excitement of the movie coming out the year after threw me over the moon! With this history, I think it is safe to say that I was a fan of the book before I even read it.The Great Gatsby has so many ideas that are still true today. It is very relatable and drew me in by the use of symbolism. Fitzgerald's personification of a billboard being used as the ""eyes of God"" that watched everything that everyone did and the use of the green light at the end of Gatsby's dock representing his dream had me pleading for more. To this day I cannot get enough of the way Fitzgerald created this world and the little hints he used to explore the many ideas presented in this book. I normally do not geek this much over old literature but The Great Gatsby is one of the greatest books out there. "
1124,R.J. Askew,"F.Scott Fitzgerald's famous Gatsby - James Gatz - dies while floating in his own swimming pool, shot by Wilson, ""one of those worn out men"", who then shoots himself in Gatsby's garden.Wilson mistakenly thinks Gatsby killed Myrtle Wilson, his sensuous and adulterous wife and suspects Gatsby of being her lover.Myrtle is in fact mown down accidentally by Daisy - Gatsby's unworthy muse - while she is at the wheel of Gatsby's car after an emotionally turbid time one stifling afternoon in New York.Daisy' is married to Tom Buchanan, a polo-playing, self-serving hypocrite who is Myrtle's real lover. Tom suspects Gatsby is a lying bootlegger, yet himself breaks Myrtle's nose during a drinking spree at their love nest.And so most of the more luckless players end up dead while the ""careless people"", Tom and Daisy, survive the wreck to retreat ""back into their money...their vast carelessness"".How arch that Daisy - note the name - sends neither word nor flower to Gatsby's funeral, which only Nick Carraway, Gatsby's neighbour our narrator, attends - along with one mysterious former party goer apart, about whom more anon.The pathos, bathos and bitterness of the final three of the novella's nine chapters are underscored by Gatsby's ""purposeless splendour"", which is in turn emphasised by his shocking downfall after ""Jay Gatsby had broken up like glass against Tom's hard malice"".The story is an ebbing from dream to reality, with Chapter 3 the high fantasy mark from whence we are ""borne back ceaselessly into the past"" as Gatsby succumbs.How fitting that Nick retreats to his mid-west when all's done, a state of mind more than a place.Of the 236 passages I underlined in my 1979 Penguin Gatsby this is the one, this, for me, is the story's beating hear, literally in fact:""His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her.""Later, Daisy gets up, goes over to Gatsby, pulls his face down in public, ""kissing him on the mouth,"" prompting her friend Jordan to call her ""a low, vulgar girl.""Poor old Gatsby.Of course he is in love, in an odd way: ""there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or gesture of exulation a new well-being radiated from him.""Yes, Daisy ends in tears and is driven into a corner where she declares to Tom that she has never loved. She vacillates as Gatsby and Tom struggle to possess her one unbearably hot afternoon. ""You love me...you never loved me...did you love me?""She fails Gatsby, tumbles short of his dreams, ""not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion."" which had ""gone beyond her, beyond everything.""His parties cease when Daisy attends one and he meets her and senses she does not like them.Yet, his infatuation with her make Nick observe, ""he came alive to me delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendour.""Many of us have a bit of the Gatsby in us, dream of this and that, sustain grand and unrealisit hopes for years. It is a human trait, at the root of much of our creativity. Others are happier in the Dreamless Tyranny of Fact Based Reality. Perhaps this is why we find Jay Gatsby so compelling. We see our own hopes in his hopes and the way the green light at the end of Daisy's dock sustatains him.He did his bit in France in 1917, pushing his machine gunners beyond the line. We warm to him. (150,000 copies of The Great Gatsby are distributed to American service men in WW2, such is his popularity.) His parties are legendary. Sometimes his guests - we readers among them perhaps, ""came and went without having met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission.""Perhaps the same may be said of America.Chapters 3, 6 and 9 are the vital chapters, with Chapter 3 boasting the most ornately magnificent passages of the entire story, reflecting Gatsby in his full pomp and circumstance.That said, our eyes are also led brilliantly in Chapter 1. The distinctive shape of the Long Island's Eggs, East and West are ""...a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls that fly overhead."" And then there's our first view of Gatsby's (unnamed) mansion, ""The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walls and burning gardens - finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run."" And then there's our first marvellous encounter with man himself, seen through the eyes of Nick: ""The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that i was not alone - fifty feet away a figure had emerged frm the shadow of my neighbour's mansion and was standing with his hands in his pocket regarding the silver pepper of the stars."" We see Gatsby through Nicks eyes and the stars through Gatsby's. It is as if we are looking at the origin of Gatsby's dream, and the universal origin of all our dreams, if dream we do.So, too, there is Great Wit: ""I enjoyed the counter-raid (WW1) so much that I came back resless."" And this, ""I asked what I thought would be sedative questions."" This: ""the consoling proximity of millionaires."" Ahh, the consoling proximity of F.Scott Fitzgerald, moving our emotions around much as Tom moves his guest Nick around, ""like moving a checker to another room."" We are, of course, more than happy to be moved by such a master.But then there is this, on Gatsby's business partner of the astonishingly named Swastica Holding Company: ""A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two find growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness."" Wolfsheim, ""the man who fixed the world series in 1919"", aka Shylock, is a stock hate figure, the usurer of old, money. Just like Tom is money. Daisy is money, too. Money is money. America is money. Is that what Gatsby craves the most, to kiss the money? To be himself, money? There is a corrupting terrible hatred in all this, an irreconcileable contradiction in Gatsby's mid-west soul. Money is all, ugly money beauty. Yet we are fascinated by him, because we see something we recognise in him and something of him in us, too.The world displays ""a ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny."" Oh how we, too, know that feeling.And then, as his dream fades, he becomes James Gatz. We learn his back story. ""I turned towards Mr.Gatsby, but he was no longer there."" Each chapter peels back his past until at the end we have his humble, confused father revealing his beloved boy's 'SCHEDULE' for self-improvement written in the fly-leaf of 'HOPALONG CASSIDY', 1906.The shift from the ethereal dream in motion in Chapter 3 to the grim corporeality of a group of bickering people in Chapter 7 one hot New York afternoon is captured when narrator Nick says, ""I have a sharp physical memory that , in the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs.""The outcome is hinted at, again by Nick who is thirty now and dreading the decade ahead. ""So we drove on towards death through the cooling night."" So, too, he says when Tom is excoriating his love rival, ""The words seem to bite physically into Gatsby."" Bullets anon.Tom the libertine-turned-prig who, during and earlier flight of vanity takes Nick to meet Myrtle his lover, gets drunk and then ""with a short deft movement with his open hand"", breaks her nose in a petty row.Poor Myrtle, ""carries her flesh sensuously"" and whose nerves are ""continually smouldering"". Tom buys her a puppy on a whim, which in a way symbolises all she is to him.Meahwhile her dreamless cuckold of a husband mingles ""immediatly with the cement colour of the walls.""Poor Myrtle, hemmed in by her suspcious lump of a husband, her own suspicion and jealousy in turn drive her to run from her house and into the path of Daisy speeding along at the wheel of Gatsby's car as she flees the scene of her own love trauma.Poor Gatsby, in Chapter 3 Nick says of his smile, ""It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurace in it, that you come across four or five times in life. It faced - or seemed to face - the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour.""But that was at the apex of Gatsby's pomp, when at one of his parties we read,""...her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer's basket.""Ach, the magic that was Gastby, the very sight of his yellow coupe brings joy, even to a passing funeral. ""I was glad,"" Nick observes of said sepulchral moment, ""that the sight of Gatsby's splendid car was included in their sombre holiday.""How arch that that same carriage becomes the cause of Myrtle's death as the illusion of Gatby unravels anon.Are we, I wonder, in the funeral party watching Gatsby pass? Is life death? Are our reading eyes the faded eyes of Doctor T.J.Eckleburg on the advertising hoarding overlooking the ashpits where Mertle Wilson lives and dies?James Gatz is now walking ""a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers,"" the dream of Daisy included.Nick again, ""What had amused me then turned septic on the air now.""As Tom's athletic frame fills a door, blocking out the light, in an early chapter, Myrtle's sensuous frame blocks out the light in another door in anaother chapter. Intimations. Premonitions. Gatsby, whose imagination latches onto ""a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy's wing..."" Gatsby the stargazer is thwarted by the banality of how we are, physical, banal.His only real moment of joy with Daisy is when he strews his perfectly folded English shirts before her and Nick as he shows them round his mansion and she buries her face in them ... and crys. His craves to hear her tell Tom that she never loved him, is hardly devoted to her happiness.Yet, old sport, he did well in the war, moved his machine guns up, held the line. And he is willing to take the rap for Daisy, to say he was driving, that he mowed Myrtle down. Nick stands by him to the end, too. And we have come to trust Nick, ""one of the few honest people I have ever known."" ""They're a rotten crowd,"" Nick shouts across the lawn to Gatsby, his last words to him. ""You're worth the whole damn lot of them together.""And so to Gatsby's funeral.No one turns up, save Nick and one other, the owl-eyes drunk encountered by Nick in Gatsby's library at one of his revelries. The drunk is admiring a book with a sense of dumbfounded drunken awe. The book, to the drunk's maudlin astonishment, is real. Is that all that is really real in a worthwhile way, the book, the story? Is the drunk in the library the author examining the reality of his existance? F.Scott Fitzgerald was a drinker. Was the drunk the author writing himself into a role at the funeral of his creation, The Great Gatsby? Was the non-drinking Gatsby something of how the author might have preferred himself to be? Did the author romp with the mind of God through his creation? I think yes.There is little left of Gatsby in the end. Nick, tells us, ""I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say."" A weakness in the story perhaps. A player as accomplished at Gatsby would surely always have another thread to spin. But maybe this failure makes him a little more human, as if he too is trapped in a creation that is far bigger than can cope with. And maybe he is troubled by his sham: ""He hurried the phrase 'educated at Oxford', or swallowed it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him.""Gatsby's dream dies before he does, leaving him floating in his pool for the first and only time in, ""A new workd, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about ... like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding doward hin threough the amorphous trees."" Wilson, his killer, a man ""so dumb"", according to Tom, ""he doesn't know he's alive"".The story ends for me almost as it began, with the lawn, which is now, as Nick tells us ""grown as long as mine."" At the outset said lawn was a live thing racing up from the beach leaping over sundials and becoming vines on Gatsby's mansion through its sheer momentum. We see it being mown prior to Gatsby's meeting with Daisy at Nick's place. Nick and Gatsby's lawns are conjoineed, there is neither fence nor hedge between them. Ach, the sentiment of Nick's final withdrawal! ""I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more. Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand.""There follow 30 more closing lines. The lights are going out and there is a ferryboat across the Sound, which could be the Styx, and the ""inessential houses"" melt away as NIck ponders the dreams of the Dutch sailors who first set eyes on the place and the greatest of all human dreams: ""for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent."" Ach, the wonder of it! And the wonder of Gatsby The Great Dreamer, when he first saw ""the green light at the end of Daisy's dock."" Ach, and then Nick sees what Gatsby failed to see, that his dream was already in his past, back in the mid-west, where, he Nick, now returns as the current bears him, too, ""back ceaselessly into the past.""If only Gatsby had never kissed Daisy. But he did. And for half a decade the dream of Daisy sustained him and made him Petrachian in his servitude to it, inspired and inspiring, a fabulous failure who dies a ridiculous death.KISSING DAISYYour dream lives on in all I doI dream, I dream, I dream of youOf consumation in the kissI am consumed by winning blissOn leaping lawns of luscious grassI cast my stardust in their eyesAll that I am is brilliant liesOld sport is but a brittle glassA dream, a dream of broken barsWho taps his tuning fork on starsWho dies a somber death aloneAnd flies - immortal Gatsby knownO how he bleeds so fluentlyThat we may romp - dreamalityby R.J.Askew, June 2012."
1125,Andrew Smith,"The Great Gatsby lived up to all the expectations I had for it. Throughout my life, I've incessantly heard about the book and it has several movie adaptations and a video game, so it ought to be good. Well, it was just as good as it seemed. The characters and plot are extremely intriguing, the symbolism present is beautifully well-constructed within the novel, and my favorite part about this novel is that it's interesting from the beginning to the end. Usually when I read a book, the beginning couple of chapters are extremely boring and oftentimes they leave me with a bad taste in my mouth as I read through the rest of the book. The Great Gatsby, however, starts off in a fun and sensible way and remains like that throughout the rest of the book. Several things can be taken away from this read as well. For one thing, the green light is a message that one should desire happiness in life rather than wealth. Another is that this book really stresses why dishonesty and cheating within relationships is wrong, even from the very first chapter. Finally, it's important for a relationship to be founded on genuine love rather than social class or money. To me, The Great Gatsby really is the perfect novel; not only does it keep the reader's interest throughout, but it illustrates several excellent lessons to live by as well."
1126,Bob Hesselberth,"I was decades younger when I first read The GG, and I found it boring. The second time I read it was 3 or 4 years ago with the Athenaeum Book Club in Rochester NY. There's nothing like a good book club to make a book come alive. This time I liked it. Recently, I wanted to include a reference to the story in my own memoir, so I decided to read it still another time. If I was going to be literary in my own writing, I should at least get the reference right, right? This time I actually understood the plot, the theme, some of the symbols, and what Fitzgerald was trying to accomplish. It's a great book. Some of the book club members thought it was THE greatest American novel ever. I disagree. It's great, but not at the top of the list. I found two flaws: Some of Fitzgerald's prose tends toward a light shade of purple, but only in a couple of places. Secondly, there are two or three references or statements that I found confusing. Nonetheless, the book's portrayal of a wasteful (though small?) segment of society is excellent, almost poetic. Great book!"
1127,Aurelie,"The Great Gatsby is another classic of modern American Literature. Love it or hate it, you can't deny it. Personnally, this is one of my favorite books. I'm not american and maybe that's a reason why I love it so much. There's something different, disorienting about this book. First of all, it is set in the 1920's, an often fantasized period (artistic and cultural dynamism, jazz, dance, etc). The characters are from the upper-class: they party, drink, dance, cheat on their wife or husband, and unfortunately get killed. There's an obsession with rich people's life that is still going on (see politics, celebs, or even Gossip Girl !). The storyline is really simple but with a dramatic ending. Nick Carraway moves to New York and meets his new neighbour, Jay Gatsby, known for throwing huge parties in his mansion. Nick's cousin, Daisy, and her husband Tom Buchanan, get involved in the story and then the drama begin. The lesson of the book to me is that money can't buy happiness. I really look forward to seeing the movie directed by Baz Luhrmann !"
1128,Fernanda,http://www.segredosemlivros.com/2015/...
1129,Alex,"I remember reading this in high school and liking it because it was ""colorful"". I didn't know how else to describe it. This time around I realized that, in addition the imagery, what I probably meant was that each character is extremely well-defined and unique. I often find it difficult to internalize characters' feelings and motivations, but it's simple in ""Gatsby"". Whether or not you agree with a character's actions, it's always clear why each character acts how he or she does, and I feel like that's not an easy thing to convey.Favorite quotes:""... and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the 'well-rounded' man. This isn't just an epigram - life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.""""Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply...""""But I am slow thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires...""""It's a great advantage not to drink among hard drinking people. You can hold your tongue and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don't see or care.""""'Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead,'..."""
1130,Michael Shu,"I liked The Great Gatsby because it's a beautifully woven tragedy of broken dreams, unfulfilled ambitions, and a tragic demise. I love the way Fitzgerald depicts Gatsby. He depicts him as a man with an inexhaustible amount of hope. Of desire, for the past. For what could've happened. For the misleading image that Gatsby remembers Daisy by. He stalks this perfect life, with great vigor. And just before he can reach, and grab it, inches from his face, he is cut down by the very dream he chases."
1131,Sergio Burgoa,"The Great Gatsby“The Great Gatsby” by F. Scott Fitzgerald is an extraordinary novel and love story about money, big parties, big houses and more money. What makes this book so fun to read is the time and place this book is set at, the summer of 1922, New York, New York. Set in the jazz era, big, fun and fancy parties hosted by millionaire, Jay Gatsby every night, actually has a very deep and beautiful meaning. Those parties aren't just for everyone to enjoy, actual its that at all, it's only for his one true love to come wander in one of the parties so they can meet again after 5 years of his absence. F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby is a very different type of novel with a whole lot of fun and is a good read.	The Style Fitzgerald writes his book is very interesting, from a character, Nick Carraway who, from a simple Minnesota town, jumps into action, into money, and into booming New York. Nick Carraway is actually writing the book during the book which is very unique. Nick comes to New York to sell stocks from Brooklyn but he lives in West Egg, Long Island where his neighbor is the mysterious Great Gatsby. Nick quickly takes a liking towards Gatsby and they become friends. Gatsby wants to get his love, Daisy back from the rich and powerful Tom Buchanan. Nick being Daisy’s cousin, Gatsby can ask nick to help him get daisy to have tea with him. Gatsby was stuck with his past with Daisy and even though he becomes rich off of nothing, he cannot move on which was his greatest mistake.	I really enjoyed reading The Great Gatsby, it was a really fun, unique and good read. I definitely recommend reading this book. It is different and if you like The jazz era, money and big parties, like I do, then you will really like this book. But also if you like a love story or like to cry then maybe you should read this. All in all The Great Gatsby is a need to read at least once because it is a very unique novel with a good life lesson for all. "
1132,Hákon Gunnarsson,"Before reading The Great Gatsby I didn't know much about it other than it was set during the Roaring Twenties, but having finished it I have to say it wasn't quite the story I thought it was. In fact it was very different from the story I imagined it to be. That is not a bad thing. The novel is actually better than I thought it was going to be. It seems strange to think that F. Scott Fitzgerald died believing that his work was forgotten, and he a failed writer. He didn't fail with this one, that much I can say.In form, it is a classic plot of man reaching high, and then crashing down again. The story is told from the perspective of a one of Gatsby's neighbors, Nick Carraway. Gatsby seems to have it all: money, mansion, friends, and more parties than most people have time for. Carraway gets invited into this world and watches on as things start to unravel. I can't find many flaws in this novel, none that I would like to mention. Characters feel for most parts very real, and it is interesting to see the development in Carraway and Gatsby as the novel moves on. And the way Gatsby's past is slowly revealed is very well done. The ending is a classic. There is a little bit of Greek tragedy in all of this, and it is all the better for it.The Great Gatsby wasn't what I was expecting. Don't ask me why, but somehow I had got it into my head that it was a crime novel. Like I said I didn't know much about it until I actually read it. And crimes are present there, but that is not what the novel is about. It is about the characters, mostly about Gatsby, but also Carraway. It is about friendship, it is about over reaching, it is about love, it is about class, and so on. Like other really good novels, it is about a lot more than seems on the surface. To me this is a really re-readable classic."
1133,Olivia McCloskey,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is considered one of the greatest American novels of the 20th century. Appropriately, I was assigned to read it for my American Lit. class. And of course I was the genius who left it to the last minute and was forced to read it over the course of two days. Fortunately, the book is relatively short, and despite my skimpy allotted reading time, this is one of my favorite classics. And no, that is not solely based upon the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio starred in the movie adaptation. As an added bonus, my teacher is showing us the film during class over the next several days. But enough of my ramblings about my 10th grade English class. The story is retold by the writings of Nick Carroway, who serves as the first person narrator throughout the novel. Set in 1922, the book centers around the fictional city of West Egg in Long Island, New York. When Nick moves to West Egg at the beginning of the novel, he quickly hears rumors circulating about his mysterious millionaire neighbor, a many in his 30s by the name of Jay Gatsby. Gatsby is known throughout New York for his infamous parties held at his lavish estate. The source of Gatsby's wealth, however, is not immediately apparent and becomes a central question as the narrative progresses. As Nick befriends his new neighbor, he uncovers the secrets of Gatsby's past - secrets that he alone has heard. When Nick learns of the significance of the green light that can be seen across the bay from Gatsby's dock, he realizes that Gatsby is a man overcome with loneliness and grief. Buried in a world of fantasy and illusion, Gatsby remains rooted in the past, oblivious to the ever-changing world around him.When I initially dove headfirst into the book, I had minimal knowledge of the plot and characters. I don't even think I had read the back cover prior to reading the book. Therefore, I was under the impression that I was launching into an epic love story between Daisy and Gatsby. I could not have been farther from the truth. The Great Gatsby is certainly no sappy romance. Instead, it recounts the story of a heartbroken man wishing to rekindle a romance with someone who has already moved on. While the characters' true thoughts and intentions are not immediately apparent, they become more transparent as the plot unravels, revealing their defining traits and characteristics.My favorite component of this book was F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing style. He was gifted with words, weaving a flawless novel that captivates and enchants readers. Looking beyond the face value of his writing, a series of hidden meanings and underlying themes are revealed, making it evident why this book has withstood the test of time. F. Scott Fitzgerald drew from his own personal experience while writing The Great Gatsby, expertly incorporating raw emotions into his work. The tragic ending leaves much up to the imagination of the reader, establishing several unanswered, lingering questions.I also enjoyed the depth and personalities of the characters. Each character has complex and conflicted emotions which gradually become apparent. Bonds are formed and broken as the characters shift and change, revealing their true identities as the novel runs its course. I was intrigued by the backgrounds of each respective character, which remained mysterious and uncertain for the majority of the book. The brief snatches of information that were revealed breathed life into each character, making them realistic and three-dimensional.While I wouldn't recommend attempting to read this book in two days, I would recommend it to anyone who has not yet had the opportunity to read it. It certainly surpassed my expectations of any classic. It's modern language and setting are easily comprehensible, setting it apart from many other classics. Despite its somewhat slow start, the plot quickly picks up, captivating readers until the very end. It was definitely worth reading, and I would be more than willing to reread it a few years from now."
1134,Vishvapani,"The Great Gatsby is, of course, a perfectly written novel and a delight - from word to word and in its entirety. It is about illusion and reinvention that resonates on may levels, most obviously as a cultural critique. On this reading I found myself asking why the narrator so admires Gatsby - the charlatan, the bootlegger, the parvenu? What is the moral power in the book that makes him worth' the whole damn lot of them'?Yes, Gatsby is an innocent who falls victim to the hard realities of money and class that lie beneath the American promise of meritocracy. But he evokes a stronger pathos than this would merit. Gatsby is a free artist of himself. His first creation is the persona of Jay Gatsby, shaped from the rough material of James Gatz. Fitzgerald tells us that Gatsby has a Platonic idea of himself, which means that he believes the idealised Gatsby he holds in his mind is the real, true self that he is materialising. That is more romantic and more evocative than simple self-delusion.“The truth was that Jay Gatsby, of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself. He was a son of God—a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that—and he must be about His Father’s business, the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty. So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen year old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.” p.104His second creation is the image of glamour that is epitomised in his famous parties, and this too is a platonic artwork that he has created for the sake of love, for Daisy's sake. Gatsby evokes pathos because, while he epitomises success, he is not, in fact, ambitious. He is serving the ideal, which is Daisy herself and the shared life with her that he imagines. In truth he loves a Platonic idea of Daisy. Gatsby's pathos is that reality is other than his imaginings and his motives are more confused than he knows. Here is Carraway's imagining of his state of mind at the end, and the emptiness that remains when his idealisations fail: ""he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about...""(169)That is Gatsby's gnostic fall, and Fitzgerald's an emptying out of meaning. The book's power lies in the deep equivocation of its stance towards what imagination can create, and its aspiration to escape necessity. All that is there in the famous concluding sentences: ""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedAnnotatees before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter — tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning ——So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
1135,Towkir Ahmmed,"'So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past'I don't know yet what to write in the review. I am just trying to digest the book that I have just finished."
1136,Anna Wilson,"The first time I read this it made me want to puke. The second time I liked it okay. The third time I fell in love with tragic, ambitious, materialistic America and Jay Gatsby who is so much more and so much less than we want him to be. If I read it a fourth time it might make me want to puke again, so I think I'll let it be. "
1137,Morgan Forry,A lovely book created by one of the most wonderful brains.
1138,Hannah.,"What an excellent book. My dad recommended this to me because it's his favourite book and I'm so glad I read it. It took me a while to read this one because I've had a lot going on recently and also a lot of exams, but once I got past the halfway mark I couldn't put it down. The characters are so intriguing and the language used in this book is stunning. I'd recommend this to everyone, especially as it's very short, so easy to become engrossed in and finish in one day."
1139,Claire Hassig,"For the record: Audible has a version of this that's read by Tim Robbins, and it is FANTASTIC. Made me cry at work. "
1140,liesolitte,"Creo que llevo queriendo leer este libro desde que me enteré de su existencia, o sea, unos meses antes del estreno de la película protagonizada por Leonardo DiCaprio. Tenía este libro en la estantería de mucho antes, apenas le presté atención, no me llamaba ni el título ni el color siquiera de la portada. Así que leí bastantes otros libros antes que ese.Pero finalmente como dije al principio, cuando descubrí su existencia estuve mucho tiempo queriendo tener varios días libres para leerlo tranquilamente y sin prisa, y finalmente lo hice.Es un libro que te marca. No sólo la personalidad de Gatsby, el cual te inquieta por su tan misterioso aura, sino también la personalidad tan excelente definida de cada uno de los personajes.Hay un momento en que te sorprendes de cómo todas las historias poco a poco se relacionan entre sí, cómo las cosas van cambiando a las pocas páginas y lo que creías ya no es lo que es; definitivamente es uno de esos libros que te enganchan.Por supuesto el final es... totalmente inesperado. Altamente recomendable. MUY recomendable. "

1143,Ryan Waldroop,"The Great Gatsby is a novel written by F. Scott Fitzgerald that mostly takes place in New York in the early 1920’s. The main character, Nick Carraway, has recently moved into a home in West Egg. He is very well educated (from Yale), but doesn’t make very much money. He lives next door to strange man that lives in an enormous house and frequently throws huge, extraordinary parties with hundreds of people. He later learns that this man’s name is Jay Gatsby, a rich war hero of World War I. 	As you read, you come to find that the relationships between these two and five other characters (Tom and Daisy Buchanan, Jordan Baker, and George and Myrtle Wilson) are very confusing. Tom and Daisy are married, but it is a terrible marriage. Tom has a mistress, Myrtle Wilson, who is married to George Wilson, and Daisy, Nick’s cousin, no longer loves Tom. She has been in love with Gatsby since he left for the war. When she and Gatsby are finally reintroduced to each other by Nick, they quickly fall in love. The only simple relationship is that of Jordan Baker and Nick Carraway who are both single and like each other, but it doesn’t end well for them because Nick soon grows tired of her. 	I would and will definitely recommend this book to anyone. It is excellently written with superb detail and characterization. It isn’t necessarily full of action, but it is exciting neverthelesswith all of the personal drama and mishaps between the characters. It definitely makes you think about what’s going on. In my opinion, this novel is a timeless classic that everyone should read. "
1144,Darcy Leech,"Nick Carraway is my favorite unreliable narrator in fiction literature. If you've read The Great Gatsby once, take it from an AP Language teacher who taught it for 6 years, you need to read it again with a questioning ear for what Nick tells you. Read the end of chapter two thinking of Nick as an unreliable narrator who is searching for himself and unwilling to reveal every detail of his involvement in this story. I read this book as a social satire where the narrator himself is Fitzgerald's main object of satire. Nick Carraway is the detached, casual observer, the morally ambiguous non-decision maker who can't even remember his own birthday with enough self advocacy to have others acknowledge him. Nick Carraway is a beautiful representation of what we are in our insecurity - when we let the popularity and clout of others determine our own fate more than our moral compass or internal character. Nick Carraway as an Object of Satire - by Darcy LeechIn F. Scott Fitzgerald’s work, The Great Gatsby, the narrator Nick Carraway is often inconsistent in his personal statements, ambiguous as to fact and events, and hides important facts from the reader. Nick, as Kent Cartwright argued in “Nick Carraway as an Unreliable Narrator,” is an unreliable narrator. Narrating on events as they unfold, Nick watches the moral decadence of adultery and mafia connections through the filtered lens of willful ignorance and suspended judgment. Nick Carraway does not represent the voice of F. Scott Fitzgerald, but is instead an object of satire in The Great Gatsby. Reading through the novel, alert readers are unsettled and uncertain as to Nick’s perception of Gatsby and the integrity of his views. Beginning early in chapter one Nick offers conflicting judgments on Gatsby’s tale: that “Gatsby… represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn,” and “Gatsby turned out all right in the end” (2). Dan Coleman suggests that “Nick’s entire story is a way of keeping his promise [that Gatsby turned out all right]” (Coleman 62). At times it does seem as if Nick is trying to prove that Gatsby turned out all right, for example, when Nick erases the obscene word written in chalk on Gatsby’s steps after his death (181). At others it seems as if he is retelling the story with a dislike he acquired after the events, such as his reaction to the compliment he gives Gatsby, “They’re a rotten crowd, you’re worth the whole damn bunch put together,” when Nick says “it was the only compliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end” (154). Nick is not honest with his emotions or reaction to Gatsby, as it is evident that he is obsessed with Gatsby, at times even admiring him. Due to Nick’s ambivalence about Gatsby and his polar opposite views on his character, the reader is left to search for their own views on Gatsby and his environment. Fitzgerald created a narrator who admits to the reader on the opening page “I’m inclined to reserve all judgments,” calling the habit a “matter of infinite hope” (1). One of the rare character judgments Nick makes is about himself, and sets him up as Fitzgerald’s object of satire, when Nick says: “Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known” (60). As Laura Barrett suggests: “Nick is torn between two types of vision and expression: straightforward reporting of a specific moment and space versus a romanticized account of a universal, timeless image” (Barrett 546), causing his fact to blur between fiction, ambivalence, and omission. Nick not only does this in his narration, but also in the assessment of his own thoughts and perceptions. Nick, as his ironic claim suggests, is not honest with himself, nor completely honest with the reader. Nick Carraway is an imaginative character adept in creating stories. He also plays along with other characters’ fiction-making. In the scene where he tells Daisy of how the town misses her, he lies in exaggeration saying: “The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath and there’s a persistent wail all night along the North Shore” (10). When Gatsby is telling Nick of his Oxford education and ancestry Nick tetters between disbelief and incredulous laughter until he buys into Gatsby’s fantasy: “My incredulity was submerged in fascination now” (67). By viewing a medal and a photo (the validity of both are questionable) Nick goes from seeing a “turbaned ‘character’ leaking sawdust at every pore,” (66) in a mocking hyperbole of Gatsby’s story to absolute belief: “Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease” (67). Nick’s creativity and refusal to make character judgments allows him to accept Gatsby’s lies as romantic and ideal facts. He associates and befriends a corrupt character with mafia ties and bootlegging money, viewing him as a hero until truth is forced upon him by an outside source: Tom Buchanan. When Tom confronts Gatsby over Daisy, he reveals his research, calling Gatsby a bootlegger tied to Wolfsheim, a man who intimidates Walter from giving out his darker secrets. Nick looks at Gatsby and is “startled at his expression… as if he had ‘killed a man’” (135). Nick is too naive and willing to accept other’s stories to find truth and meaning in what characters do and don’t say. Thus, he finds himself throughout the novel supporting Gatsby, a character who represents everything for which he has unaffected scorn, yet due to his lack of perception and reservation of judgments, Nick fails to see what Gatsby represents until an outside source reveals the truth. Gatsby as a character, as Anthony Larson puts it, is “read as a moral lesson on the excesses and failures of a certain America and – perhaps - the American dream itself” (Larson 285). Larson also states that through the East Egg – West Egg comparison “the reader is quick to recognize the emptiness holding all of this up, the moral price paid by America for its capitalist excess” (Larson 286). Nick’s narration is filled with ambiguity, and the pleasure of reading The Great Gatsby is to see through the story beyond the filtered lens of the narrator. Here Fitzgerald’s literary style is given purpose: “it encourages a critical attitude on the part of the reader to expose Gatsby for what he is, and in the process, teach the reader a lesson” (Larson 288). Fitzgerald is taking the reader through an exercise in making judgments or following the flow of the stream leading to chaos and decadence. Nick is the tool that allows this experiment with the seemingly ambiguous character of Gatsby. At the end of the novel Nick erases the obscene words on Gatsby’s white steps after his death, attempting to whitewash the name of Gatsby by never revealing to the reader what that word was and “eras[ing] it, drawing [his] shoe raspingly along the stone” (181). As Barbara Will suggests, “the text stakes its ending on the inevitability of our forgetting everything about Gatsby that has proved troublesome about his character up to this point” (Will 126). However, if the reader does not forget everything about Gatsby that seems a little off, this act carries great weight in examining the character of Nick. In analyzing first person fiction narration, Henrik Skov Nielsen claims that “when the narratorial functions are operating independently of the character functions, then the narration will be reliable and authoritative” (Nielsen 144). Phelan also states that “there must be a hidden narrator (or narrative voice) in the text” (Nielsen 134). In the case of the obscene word, the hidden narrator is what Nick omits. The true narrator to the story becomes the reader who sees past the coloring character functions of Nick, who both idealizes and hates Gatsby due to a lack of making judgments for himself. The reader is left to fill in the blanks left by Nick’s ambiguity, and Fitzgerald has achieved his stylistic goal – the reader has seen past the suspended judgment of Nick which made him passive witness to adultery, mafia crimes, and a hit and run murder, and searched for a more definitive approach to life: making judgments instead of being swept along by the current of decadence. Fitzgerald’s satire of Nick becomes most obvious perhaps at the end of chapter two. Nick opens the scene explaining: “I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that afternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it” (29). Tom spends the day drinking with Tom and Myrtle, hearing conversation that if Daisy wasn’t “Catholic” and against divorce Myrtle and Tom would be married, an obvious lie to which Tom says nothing. Myrtle tells of how she first met Tom, extolling hedonistic virtues saying “You can’t live forever; you can’t live forever,” (36) and later Nick witnesses Tom break her nose with a slap. Mr. McKee walks out as Myrtle cries, and Nick casually follows him, displaying complete apathy to the situation. Nick failed to make any moral judgments, and let a bleeding woman wail as he walked out the door without caring. The chapter ends in disoriented fashion: “… I was standing beside [Mr. McKee’s] bed and he was sitting up between the sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands” (38). Nick’s lack of judgment not only lead him to walk away from the scene of abuse between Tom and Myrtle and ignore the obvious lie of promised marriage Tom gave to Myrtle, but it lead him to the bedroom of a “feminine” (30) man who sits in bed in his underwear with the rest of the events going unsaid. What the narrator does not say in the course of this scene are the most telling aspects as to his character and values. He does not reveal Tom’s lie to Myrtle, contributing to Tom’s use of her as a convenient object. He offers no comfort or help to Myrtle as she bleeds from a broken nose, nor does he confront Tom, letting the brutality and beastly indulgence continue. But most importantly, from suspended judgment (figuratively and literally through his inebriation) and willful ignorance, Nick finds himself in a sexual encounter with a male and narrates the event “marred by obvious suppressions” that plague the “intimate revelations of young men” (1). This scene epitomizes Fitgerald’s use of Nick as an object of satire: by suspending judgment Nick was witness and facilitator to amoral actions and put himself into situations he tries to disown either by omission as with Mr. McKee or the obscene word, or by despise after the fact as with Gatsby and claiming he disapproved of the man from beginning to end. Nick Carraway is a narrator who gives pieces of the story to the reader. It is up to the alert and perceptive reader to fill in the holes to what Nick suppresses, omits, or alters. Fitzgerald uses Nick’s narration as a stylistic tool to create an object of satire, Nick himself. Through Nick, Fitzgerald satirizes individuals who refuse to make personal judgments in regards to the American dream, symbolized by Daisy, and the people who chase after it, symbolized by Gatsby. In this set of metaphors, Daisy is the American dream, but she is over idealized and falls short of Gatsby’s expectations. Also, Nick ignores character flaws in Daisy which make her less than heroic. Gatsby is the American chasing after the green light of promise, Daisy. He compromises part of himself in chasing after her, and falls into many holes of corruption, such as bootlegging, lying, and organized crime. Until he is shot and losses reputation, Nick idealizes Gatsby, failing to see through his façade. Nick is moved along in plot by many characters and often acts as a passive observer to the moral decadence around him. He helps Gatsby chase his dream, benefiting from the by products of the chase. He is manipulated over and over again by characters because he does not make his own judgments, essentially he does not make his own choices. Nick, however eloquent and intriguing his narration is, is the central object of Fitzgerald’s social satire of the 1920s. Nick watches his surroundings through the filtered lens of suspended judgment and willful ignorance, only to retreat to his past when things fall apart around him. Nick fails in the present because he fails to choose, a point Fitzgerald wished the reader to search for and find through Nick’s ambiguity. Works CitedBarrett, Laura.

1145,Eilis,I began to read this book with great expectations having heard so many good things about it. At first I was skeptical that it could live up to my expectations but without me even realising it I was quickly drawn into this book so much so that I found it difficult to put down. It is definitely a book that impacts on you the more you think about it after you turn that last page. The more time that has passed since I read this the more it has grown on me (it has gone from a four-star to a five-star book! :)
1146,Kahlee,"The Great Gatsby is quite different from many other novels I've read. It doesn't have a specific plot, certain characters are unlikable but It has got to be one of my favourite novels I've ever read. I have to study it next year so I decided to read it ahead of time. I am excited to read it again. Nick Caraway does nothing, he is the most unlikeable character ever. To me he is Gatsbys sidekick. He just observes never doing anything to exciting. He doesn't go after Jordan Baker at the end which I hoped so much would happen. I did enjoy Daisy Buchanan though. I know many people hate Daisy I don't know why but I just loved her so much. I absolutely hated Tom Buchanan, I feel that he is shallow and rude. I don't like him at all. I felt like Jay Gatsby is a typical character. I feel like he was kind of typical though. I expected more of dark side, more depth to him. The novel is named after him, I felt as though he should be The Great Gatsby. Although his death was tragic and unexpected It didn't hit me like other novels did. Despite several downfalls of this novel I love it. I enjoyed the novel and I look forward to reading it again, I would recommend it."
1147,Cleo,"The first time I read The Great Gatsby a few years ago, I didn't much like it. But I think that's because I didn't completely ""get"" it. And I still don't completely get it. But I really loved it the second time around. The Great Gatsby is the story of J. Gatz, who renames himself Jay Gatsby. He returns home from the war to discover that his sweetheart has married a wealthier man. He builds up a huge fortune, reinvents himself, and moves into a gigantic mansion across the bay from Daisy's home. He starts to throw huge parties which become very famous in the area; people flock from all over. The book is narrated by Nick Carraway, Gatsby's neighbor, and very possible the only non-muddled person in the book, though he has his own problems too. Gatsby meets him and solicits his help (Nick and Daisy are distant cousins), which Nick agrees to.The book is short, but really thought-provoking, and I can see why it's a classic. The language that Fitzgerald uses is just amazing. It's lyrical, and really deep and thoughtful. The story itself is rather silly; it's the writing that makes it so great. I wasn't all that fond of Fitzgerald's short stories, and I erroneously came to the conclusion that I don't like F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing. But I loved The Great Gatsby so much.Another really amazing element of the book is just the character sketches. I love how Daisy and her husband Tom are described: ""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy - they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made..."" I really loved that description of a carelessly wealthy couple. There are so many other great parts, but I can't include them all. You know what? Just read the book, and give it a try.In the end, the rich are portrayed as...well, careless. Daisy really is not a good character, and though Gatsby is all right, he's totally misguided. Nick is a bit of a coward, Tom I really hated, and Mr. and Mrs. Wilson are kind of subject to the whims of the wealthier. The decadence of this period is portrayed so well. The decadence, and yet the deep sadness, and the urge to forget. I recently watched the 2000 film version, and I think that helped me get into the book more. The film is very faithful to the book, and much of the dialogue and narration is the same, word-for-word. I would highly recommend this great twentieth century classic, and I may try Tender is the Night next.www.novareviews.blogspot.com"
1148,Bri,"I've read this book twice now and I found that the second time around I liked the book much better. What I found with this book is that the plot is not what makes the book, but rather the language that Fitzgerald uses. I found the plot to be more interesting the second time around, but I believe Fitzgerald could write about absolutely anything and I would be captivated. The way he describes things is like no other author. He paints such vivid pictures in your mind. There are so many quotes in this book that are written so beautifully and go so beyond the context of the book itself. I would recommend this book to anyone. "

1150,Achieng Onguru,"I'm yet to see a mastery of English (well apart from Jane Austen of course) such as the one displayed in this book and if you ask me, F. Scott was purely bragging with this piece. During this point in time, the art of storytelling was a privilege only a few could manage and he is one of the lucky few that could nail it. If you are a wordsmith and want to challenge your English, it's the best place to start. The story is great too, but I was captured most by it's delivery. This book represents finesse at its peak, an exquisite and intergalactic piece of literature. "
1151,Saif Raza,It's amazing rereading this book to notice how my sympathies changed from when I read it in high school. My favorite parts now are the language and self-reflection throughout the novel. 
1152,Truongmai,"A beautiful commentary on the lies and vanity of the Roaring Twenties. Set in America during the prime of the Jazz Age, the protagonist and narrator, Nick Carraway, began his alcohol induced journey as me moved next to the mansion of Jay Gatsby. From the whiskey bottle at a party, Nick embarked in the highlife of sex and alcohol alongside Gatsby and his friends. However, not all was that easy. Nick has not suddenly joined the aristocracy. Gatsby and peers are the members of the new money, struggling extravagantly in order to achieve the status and class of the old generation. Through The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald commentates on the nature of humanity and the death of the American Dream. The dreams that they all have had died a long time before and all that were left were an empty hollow shell that all tried to achieve. "
1153,Trisha Drape,"I have read ""The Great Gatsby"" at least four times and recently listened to Tim Robbins read it on CD. Fitzgerald's writing style, the 1920s, that horrible Daisy and other wretched, flawed characters, the story and the tragic ending get to me every time. "
1154,Robert Dylan,"Apart from the so called ""Roaring Twenties"", Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby"" is a novel that elaborates upon The American Dream (and what has become of it) as well, along with their wickednesses: the constant pursuit of money and the visible gap between the materialist morally-corrupted East (notably New York City and the boroughs surrounding it) opposed to the West, where people still used to approve of the moral and religious values. Last but not least, we explore the life of the well-to-do, but love-deprived Gatsby, who would even don a pink suit in order to regain his beloved one back. Despite being a classic and therefore labelled as boring, I can assure you with all my heart that this book is anything but dull. "
1155,Tilli,"I have to say that the Great Gatsby definitely surprised me. Normally I do not really enjoy classics, but this one was definitely an exception, and is 100% now my all time favourite classic book. And to make it even better, I have just found out that the theme for my prom is the Great Gatsby! I am so excited!Anyway, I definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a classic or just generally a good book. And as it has now been made into a film, I am very excited to see it and I hope that it gives the book the justice that it deserves."
1156,Dan Absalonson,"The Great Gatsby was great. I didn't remember much from when I read it in high school back in the late 90s so I wasn't sure what to expect. I do remember liking it which stood out because most books we had to read in high school were terrible, and this is coming from someone how LOVES to read! While I agree with people that most of the characters aren't exactly likable, they are interesting and reading about them was fun. If you want to read a book with characters who have no redeeming qualities give Wuthering Heights a try, those characters make the people in the Great Gatsby seem kind of nice, at least they're usually civil. I love the beautiful symbolism in this book. I love Fitzgerald's prose. It is beautiful as well. It is easy for me to appreciate Fitzgerald's writing for how well it flows, and the great command he has over it. Many classic books are like this, but have extremely boring stories. Not this one. It moves at a pretty good pace. I usually have to plow through parts of classics because they contain big blocks of boring stuff but with Gatsby I felt like I was on a grand ride the whole time, soaring over the 20s with Nick the narrator as my pilot. I sat as he did looking over the scenery as we passed over it. There's a line where he describes pulling up to an apartment. “At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment houses” (Fitzgerald, 32).He didn't fill the sentence with tons of words and yet there's so much great stuff packed in there. What an image. Quite a different image from Gatsby's big house. I just loved that line - as was the case with most of the book. The only other book I've read by Fitzgerald is This Side of Paradise. While I was often admiring the writing, it's story meandered compared to Gatsby. Another reason this book was enjoyable to read is that there are so many great images in it that stick with you. Most books I've read can only conjure up a few images when I think back on them, but Gatsby is chalked full of them and they're wonderful ones. The eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg, the ash heaps, Gatsby's yellow car, his parties, his pool, that green light across the water, I could go on.The last thing I'll say is that when reading The Great Gatsby I really got the sense of the environment, the writing did a good job of bringing me into the world of the roaring 20s. It all felt so grand bright and glittery, and at the same time grungy cheap and shallow. Shallow people surrounded by glamour. The book captures its time so well, which is why it's listed as one of the ""Great American Novels."" As far as classics go, this is one of my favorites."
1157,Noor,"I'm in love with the 1920's, so when I heard that I was going to be reading this book in my english class I was extremely excited. I had been wanting to read this book for a while, but for some reason I never did. I wish I would have read this sooner, it is my all time favorite book. I honestly can't say anything bad about it, I love every part of it. I love Gatsby's outlook on life, I love how Nick is always stuck in the middle, and I love everything about Daisy. She is elegant and smart. Plus, because of her I am in love with the color white. I don't get it how so many people hate Daisy. I think some see her as using both Tom and Gatsby, but I feel bad for her. She was in love with Gatsby but then he left so she moved on; and when Gatsby came back she had to make the descision between her old love and her current love. Even the movie version (the original, not the new remake) is amazing and captures the story so well. This book is depressing, happy, exciting, and absolutely beautiful. "
1158,Jilly,"Amazing, of course! I have to read my classics in between my sci-fi's and post-apocalyptic dystopians to keep me sane and literate. Fitzgerald's cynical view of the upper crust, old money crowd of the 20's never fails to entertain me. His stories can be harsh on the female characters, but he is not much easier on the males, except the protagonist. Great fun, old sport!"
1159,Darin Bradley,Easily among my top-five favorite novels.
1160,Fil,"Recensione su questo stupendo romanzo rimandata. Dico solo che è assolutamente imperdibile per gli amanti dei libri introspettivi. Prima una premessa sull'edizione.Quest'edizione virtuale e' consigliata solo a chi vuole risparmiare e proteggere le foreste, in quanto è gratis su amazon. La bellezza della tradizione e' che è lasciata aperta: chiunque può scrivere mail per migliorarla.Dopo un terzo del libro mi sono accorto che era un grande romanzo e mi sono procurato la versione cartacea. (Non riesco a godermi bene i libri virtuali. Se sono bei romanzi preferisco traslare.)Non sono esperto di traduzioni (so solo che il gatto e' sul tavolo) però la traduzione cartacea mi sembrava migliore di quella gratuita.Libro: consigliatissimo.Edizione: scegliete voi."
1161,Ignacio Germán,"La roca del mundo está fuertemente asentada en las alas de un hada.América, años 20, Edad del Jazz y del crecimiento y del ensueño.Gatsby es un nuevo rico, un tipo maravillado por el poderío y las fiestas y la prosperidad que ofrece el fin de la Primera Guerra Mundial, un tipo que ansía algo, y es que en el mundo en que vive todo puede ser posible, o, al menos, en su mundo. Un maldito espejismo.Parece que Gatsby encarna a esa nueva clase; y, como ella, acaba en un fracaso algo amargo, algo frustrado. Gatsby resurge de la nada, y trae con él una inmoralidad que no superará, con todo, la inmoralidad de las clases realmente altas, las ya asentadas. Gatsby desea conseguir su fortuna con el objetivo de conseguir el amor de Daisy (la muchacha de oro, cuya voz está llena de dinero). Gatsby desea con todas sus fuerzas regresar al pasado, hacer retroceder las manecillas del reloj y manejar el tiempo y sus circunstancias.Imagen con un precioso sabor a nostalgia, a sueño (roto), es seguro que nos dejará una media sonrisa arrebatadora.http://ignacio-german.blogspot.com.es/"
1162,Erica Song,"I first read this book in March this year for my school's English assignment. I was immediately captivated by the book. Although most of my friends claimed that this book was ""downright terrible because of the characters"", I found them to be absolutely charming and believable. One thing I hate worse than an overly descriptive book is a book that is filled with overly perfect characters.Although I've never actually lived in New York or in the Roaring 20s, it was easy to imagine all the scenes, especially when Nick sees Gatsby staring at the green light, and when Nick and Mr Gatz attend Gatsby's funeral. The prose is stunning - not too ornate, but with a lot of vivid imagery and metaphors. My favourite ones are the green light and when Gatsby tells Nick that Daisy's voice ""sounds like money."" It's so beautiful and insightful at the same time."

Scott Fitzgerald is one book that requires no introduction. Considered to be the pinnacle of American Literature, it is an ode to the America of the Roaring 20’s or the ‘Jazz Age’ as Fitzgerald called it. The book has influenced generations of readers since its first publication in 1925 and continues to be groundwork for modern American literature.It is narrated by the ever so amiable protagonist Nick Carraway, a young and thoughtful man from ‘West Egg’ who moves to the east to make it on his own. Nick begins his tale by informing the reader of a little bit of his own history. He also mentions how he is inclined to reserve all judgements when interacting with someone and hence strange people are attracted to him and end up confiding in him. This gives us a sense of foreboding of how the strange new peoplehe is introduced to, within the time frame of the novel, are also drawn to him.On moving to East egg, Nick reconnects with his cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom Buchanan. Daisy and Tom are dissatisfied with their marriage but are still tied together by their mutual love for decadence and gaiety. Daisy is described as quite the beauty with a charismatic albeit careless air about her while Tom is a victim of one of the most derisive remarks ever made in American Literature:“Her husband – one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-climax.” What sets the story in motion is Nick’s increasing curiosity about his wealthy and mysterious neighbour, Jay Gatsby, the eponymous hero of the novel. Gatsby has a reputation that reaches far and wide and has stories told about him in varying degrees of gossip, in spite of the fact that not many people have personally interacted with him. After a breezy mention in a conversation at Daisy’s house, Jay Gatsby is introduced in the novel as a solitary figure standing in his lawn looking at what is described as ‘a single green light, minute and far away.’Gatsby is especially known for throwing lavish and opulent parties in his magnificent mansion but among the throngs of people that attend these events, little fact is known about him. Later on, Nick is invited to one such soiree and through a friend of Daisy’s he is informed of a rather strange request from Gatsby. The story picks up pace from there and we are introduced to what is considered to be one of the most complicated web of relationships, penned down in a strong, grand style of writing. Gatsby’s history with Daisy is revealed and his obsession with her forms the crux of this tale.On the surface, The Great Gatsby is a simple tale of love lost but what makes it deserving of praise is the marvelous manner of storytelling and use of literary devices. The book is generous with splendid characterisations, personification of colours and lucid descriptions.Fitzgerald is capable of handling numerous themes framed within a comparatively simplistic plot. The affluence of America before the Great Depression forms the backdrop for this story of a man consumed by his past and his dedication to making a future out of it. Gatsby is a man who has everything and is still discontent as he sets his sights on things he cannot have. Fitzgerald delves into what the ‘Great American Dream’ really stands for and what happens when it is actually within reach. He is able to portray a compelling account of man’s constant state of ‘want.’In the end, it is a novel of humble plot but driven by its exquisitely etched out characters most of whom are unlikable yet persuasive.Check out more reviews and author interviews atIndian Book Reviews"
1164,Kathy B,"I was inspired to read it because one of my best friends rated it 5 stars and we have similar book tastes (think Confederacy of Dunces tee hee) plus it was covered extensively in Dan Maguire's first novel ""One Last Improvisation"". I wish I had read this before Dan's novel, and will be going back to revisit the parts referencing Gatsby.It is interesting, because none of the characters were very likeable, yet the story was so interesting it flowed along beautifully. I had already enjoyed his ""Tender is the Night"" and found I continue to enjoy his writing style (unlike Hemingway, who I have discovered I am more interested in reading about him than what he wrote...sorry, Hemingway fans :-)). I am glad I finally took the time to read this book...I was not disappointed."
1165,Alexander Nachaj,"Every summer, either in the early months of June after the universities have let out their wards, or in the late months of August when the early whisps of an autumn breeze tumble through the crack in the windows, I find myself falling into the days of my youth where every year, like clockwork, I would set myself down on my front porch and read a certain novel from start to finish.To some, the Great Gatsby is nothing more than an addition to the curriculum of a lazy high school English class. To others, it was a novel that explored and defined the pomp and excess of the post-war generation. To me, the Great Gatsby will always be that lost summer, that self-contained unit in time where one suddenly discovers how out of place with their society they are, how confidences can be broken, and some friends become swept away with the first leaves of autumn.Regardless of the place this book holds, or fails to hold, in your mind, memory or nostalgia, few could argue that F. Scott Fitzgerald was anything but a master storyteller, with a hold over the English language that few authors allow us to witness."
1166,Ella,"""You can't repeat the past.""""Can't repeat the past? Why of course you can!""The Great Gatsby is my new favourite novel. As soon as I picked up the book the day I bought it, I was engrossed. The Great Gatsby is set in a lavish 1920s New York, inhabited by the glamorous rich young characters who are anything but vapid (in Nick and Gatsby's cases, anyway).  Nick Carraway narrates the story. Born into a wealthy, affluent family, the beginning of his story documents him moving to a small, unkempt cottage in the shadow of his neighbour's decadent mansion, where extravagant parties are held seemingly every night. When a financially struggling Nick is invited to one of these affairs, he meets the host, Jay Gatsby. They strike up a neighbourly friendship, but as gossip surrounding Gatsby circulates around the party, Nick becomes curious as to what Jay is truly like beneath his polished, suave exterior. Reading this book I became infatuated with the narrator, Nick, and fascinated by Gatsby; they are now two of my favourite fictional characters. (view spoiler)[ This is the only novel to have made me cry - I was devastated when Gatsby was shot and when nobody attended his funeral, as despite his flaws I adored the character.  (hide spoiler)] After loving this novel I am definitely going to read some of F. Scott Fitzgerald's other works, and certainly reread The Great Gatsby many times!"
1167,Jamie Birch,"It goes without saying that The Great Gatsby is an absolute classic, yet Fitzgerald's message is delivered with such sophistication and clarity, that in my opinion remains one of the best 20th Century novels to date. From cover to cover, Fitzgerald laces each scene and event with allure and pathetic fallacy. The lawns of the bourgeois sparkle both with the hopes and whims of a materialist society and the ugly core of human nature. The American Dream rears itself, not by the ""overtly critical"", all capitalists are evil way that we have become so accustomed to, but through a form of subtlety that each and every one us can deeply identify with. Fitzgerald personifies each element of a capitalist American society through events that become increasingly tense, whilst remaining somewhat detached through the eyes of the protagonist Nick Carraway who is étranger to Long Island. Through grey dismalness and vibrancy, The Great Gatsby epitomises 20th Century culture, with ""...that green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us"", which shines as brightly today as it did in 1925. "
1168,Laura W,"I very rarely give five stars but this book really deserved it!From the get-go this book was REALLY descriptive and really realistic. From the first few pages, I already understood some of the mindset back in the 1920s. Even though this is a short book (180 pages) it didn't seem to be rushed or lacking. Nick Carraway (the narrator) seems to have so much more depth and thought than the other characters. The other characters seems so shallow which sort of fits their personality's.If you've seen the movie and haven't read the book yet, READ IT! If you loved the movie, you'll love the book because pretty much everything is almost exactly word-for-word from the book.I really have nothing but praise for this book. It's descriptions, depth of the characters in response to their personalities, the finesse in which the whole story of Jay Gatsby was pieced together, everything.So tudo's to F. Scott Fitzgerald! Five star book all around. :D"
1169,Elle,"Il Grande Gatsby è stato per me come un salto negli anni Venti, un viaggio nella magica atmosfera di quell'epoca di lusso sfrenato, di prosperità economica e di spensieratezza. Ma anche i mitici Anni Ruggenti hanno il loro lato oscuro, e Fitzgerald ci svela la vacuità e la superficialità che si nascondono dietro lo sfarzo, la ricchezza, la fama.È in questo mondo fatto di luci ed ombre che vivono i personaggi del romanzo, ricchi abitanti di Long Island, fra i quali spicca Jay Gatsby, il Grande Gatsby. Mi sono chiesta più volte cos'è che lo rendesse ""grande"", se fosse la sua ambizione, o il fatto di essere riuscito in qualche modo a realizzarla. Penso di aver trovato la risposta nel primo paragrafo del libro:""[..] Se la personalità è una serie ininterrotta di gesti riusciti, allora c'era in lui qualcosa di splendido, una sensibilità acuita alle promesse della vita [...] era una dote straordinaria di speranza, una prontezza romantica quale non ho mai trovato in altri, e quale probabilmente non troverò mai più. No: Gatsby alla fine si rivelò a posto; fu ciò che lo minava, la polvere sozza che fluttuava nella scia dei suoi sogni a stroncare momentaneamente il mio interesse nei dolori passeggeri e nei fuggevoli orgogli degli uomini.""La grandezza di Gatsby è l'obiettivo che insegue, il suo genuino sogno d'amore, e il diventare ricco a qualunque costo è solo il mezzo per realizzarlo e non è fine a se stesso. Sarà per questo che non riesco in alcun modo a condannarlo, perché per Gatsby la ricchezza e il lusso non sono nulla senza la donna che ama: ""Cosi l'intero caravanserraglio era crollato come un castello dicarta alla disapprovazione degli occhi di lei.""Ma Gatsby è solo nella sua grandezza, perché la gente che lo circonda non vede oltre la sua ricchezza, il suo immenso palazzo e le sue sfarzose feste. Nessuno sa veramente chi sia, per alcuni Gatsby è soltanto un nome senza neanche un volto, un ""nuovo ricco"" venuto fuori da chissà dove, la cui storia è avvolta nel mistero. Ma Nick Carraway, vicino di casa di Gatsby e voce narrante della storia, diventa suo amico e alla fine, nel loro ultimo incontro, riconosce il suo valore e gli rivolge per la prima e ultima volta un complimento. La delusione e la disillusione di Nick nei confronti di quel mondo, fatto di apparenze e privo di sostanza, diventerà definitiva quando, alla morte di Gatsby, nessuno si presenta al suo funerale, nonostante alle sue feste fossero sempre presenti centinaia di persone. Nick esclude Gatsby dalla sua condanna. ""Gatsby alla fine si rivelò a posto"" dice Nick, nel primo paragrafo. Si, perché Gatsby era un sognatore che inseguiva un sogno troppo grande: poter rivivere il passato. E grande è stato il suo fallimento, perché nel decennio degli anni Venti non c'è posto per il passato, nè per le illusioni. Credo che la bellissima frase conclusiva del libro sia molto chiara a questo proposito: ""Così continuiamo a remare, barche contro corrente, risospinti senza posa nel passato"". Ho amato quest'opera in tutto e per tutto. Ode a Fitzgerald."
1170,ana.,"“So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”One of the greatest masterpieces. "
1171,Ange,"[b]The Great Gatsby[/b]by F. Scott FitzgeraldGenre; Fiction, Classics, LiteraturePages: 190 Format: eBook (Nook)Rating: 5/5 stars + a favoriteThere are books that we read because they are assigned reading in our high school English class, and there are books we read for intense enjoyment. The Great Gatsby is both of these books for me.My first read-through of Gatsby was junior year of English class, in 1996. I remember having enjoyed the novel, and thought that I had understood its wit and commentary, the subtle nuances of irony and foreshadowing and the lush, descriptive passages that decorated the novel in 1920's opulence.Approximately 18 years later, at the ripe age of nearly 35, I've done a lot more reading and living and have discovered that, like a fine wine, this book gets better with time. To understand the human condition and having had the life experiences that build the moral character of an individual and complicate the intricate web of relationships with others and to know that certain eras and societal implications always add layers of depth takes us down a rather deep rabbit hole of introspection.Jay Gatsby is an illustrious bachelor living in West Egg, New York. He's the host of a series of legendary parties, drives the fanciest cars, has the most delightful clothes, owns a palatial home and has successful business ventures and more money than he knows what to do with. But there's one thing that deeply troubles Gatsby to the very core of his being, and it is our narrator Nick Carraway who exposes the subtle nuances and mysterious details that make this larger-than-life man a deeply complex and truly understandable pinnacle of American literature.F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel is not only rich in description and metaphor: it's a completely elaborate work of art which comments on the society of the times, juxtaposes the grit and grain of reality vs. the glitter of excessive hopes and expectations. It's enough to spark amazing conversations on the topics of east vs. west, money and love, idealism of riches and poverty of soul. There is glitter, there is shadow, there are hearts broken and lives lost. This is what makes Gatsby worth the re-read every time."
1172,A. Gulden,"I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.‘I am glad it’s a girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.’ Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.Her eye-brows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face.I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. “There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.”The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself.Then he kissed her. At his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture.The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me, though have a sharp memory that, in the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back.She wanted her life shaped now, immediately and the decision must be made by some force of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality that was close at hand."
1173,Lora Grigorova,"The Great Gatsby: http://readwithstyle.wordpress.com/20...One of the greatest mistakes of our education is that F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “Great American Novel” The Great Gatsby is among the mandatory literature studied in high-school. I remember the first time I read it, was for an English literature class and I hated it. We had to read a chapter or two a day and this imposition of routine on my reading combined with my utter lack of understanding as to why this novel is so great, painted a picture of it in my head as “a very stupid book”. I am inclined to believe I am not the only one who felt that way. Reading reviews from many people, they all seemed to share the same experience – they read it and hated it in high school. Then they read it at a more mature age and absolutely loved it.For me it was slightly different. I started loving it without reading it a second time. As time passed and my view of the world changed from drinking booze till I pass out to more tangible goals (drinking booze but not passing out, please) I started to appreciate the beauty of The Great Gatsby. The prose is like a perfectly written poem – it flows easily like a song, enchanting, attracting, shocking. F. Scott Fitzgerald is one of my most favorite authors of fiction because he writes as if he was born only to do that – his novels are lean, to-the-point, without over-writing, and yet powerful and disturbing. And so, as the yet another movie adaptation is upon us and given that Leonardo DiCaprio is my most favorite author of all times (I could not imagine any other living author playing Gatsby) I figured it is about time I read The Great Gatsby a second time and see if I do really love it or it’s some kind of false remembrance from the past.Read more: http://readwithstyle.wordpress.com/20..."
1174,Sebastian,"The Great Gatsby is among the best novels of American literature. Fitzegarld focuses the novel on Gatsby, ""only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction-Gatsby who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn.""(2.) Gatsby is quite an intricated character. Throughout the novel decay determines a strong presence: the valley of ashes, the color yellow and Gatsby. ""Nobody is invited to his parties, the people just find themselves there"". Gatsby is a light that attracts every insect to him. All but one: Daisy. Daisy, she represents the highest possession for him. But he can't have her, she is like a god for him, and he can't have her, Gatsby is doomed to eternal damnation. Fitzeragld depicts the roaring 20's in such a melancholy manner. The American Dream, one of the overarching themes of the 20's is quite decayed in the book. Gatsby is quite rich, yes, so his Tom but their souls are wretched. ""The only respectable thing about you is your money Tom""(Gatsby), that seems to include materialism in one sentence. Gatsby himself prides materialism high above anything else, for his persona was created by a 17 year old boy, success is the essence of Gatsby, without it he is nothing. Success is the very essence of his own existence, and ""conquering"" Daisy seems like his best triumph, the one which he will never be able to obtain. "
1175,Daiva,While reading this book I had a problem comparing with with movie but I was not disappointed in either of them. It was probably the first time when movie was so well recreated (not sure how to say) and almost everything I read in this book I found in movie as well which was a good thing because it makes me wonder what I liked more and at the same time give 5 stars for this amazing Fitzgerald book.
1176,Alex Helander,"The Great Gatsby is told from the point of view of Nick Carraway. Nick Carraway moves east and meets his cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom, who Nick knew from Yale. The couple is not really happy together and Tom has an affair with Myrtle Wilson. In the early portion of the book there is this mystery about Mr. Jay Gatsby, Nick's neighbor. Gatsby host notorious parties with orchestras, alcohol (witch is illegal because of prohibition), and other festive accessories. No one really knows where Gatsby acquired his wealth, people think he was a German spy during the war or that he killed a man. Readers learn that Gatsby has a love interest in Daisy, which started when Gatsby was stationed in Louisville. When Gatsby left for the war Daisy married Tom. Gatsby wants Daisy to leave Tom and for them to be together like in the past. He wants Daisy to admit she never loved Tom and so they can be together. We learn that Gatsby's fortune was made through illegal bootlegging and he was a boy of poor farmer and was very ambitious.He met a rich man and learned the mannerisms of the wealthy class. When he meet Daisy he did not think she would love him if she knew he came from a poor family. So then Gatsby became a self made man and once Daisy was his he would have reached the pinnacle of success. However, after a very emotional dinner Daisy hits Tom's lover with a car. Gatsby, being so in love with Daisy, takes the blame of killing Myrtle and has to deal with deadly consequences. (some major events were vaguely hinted at, so that any person who has not read the book will enjoy it as much as I did) I loved this story. It displays the idea of American ambition. Gatsby became part of a world very different than himself to have the love of his life (for example Gatsby is a bootlegger and has parties with lots of alcohol but never drinks it). It is a very depressing story about a man who rises from rags to riches and is still not able to be fully happy and be with his dream girl. Then the people born into wealth are able to be in relationships, but, like Gatsby, they are also not happy. This story really shows that money can not buy you love and happiness. The themes and the plot are so great in this story.The symbolism and the themes all have valuable meanings. The Great Gatsby also shows the problems of the upper class and their wastefulness. This book delivers important messages and lessons about life while being a VERY entertaining story. It proves to stand to the title of being an ""American Classic"". "
1177,Helmisade,"Another book in my self-education project of trying to read the classics I didn't read back in school. This is one that is mentioned so often, I knew the names of the main characters and still I never knew what this book was actually about. Never even saw the movie!Well, my first thought starting to read was that the book is written in a beautifull way. I was so right to read this one in English! I was compelled to read several bits aloud to myself just to hear the lovely sentences roll of my tongue. There were many parts that the more passionate teenage-me would have described as ""perfect sentences"". Something that makes you shiver with linguistic pleasure. Teenage-me does not approve of your laughing, but I do:DA lot of stuff has already been written about the story, the depiction of lost dreams, lives lived with and through fantasies and the surprising emptiness of a seemingly perfect life. No need to go there, I'd hate to repeat what others have already said. But I am now officially a fan of this book."
1178,Aubrey Hragyil,"  I have recently finished reading one of the most classic literature known to the American society, ""The Great Gatsby"". There are no words I could use to describe the brilliance of this piece of writing. To provide an understatement this book was astounding in every manner. From the content in the book to the actual writing provided by F. Scott Fitzgerald, it stuns the reader in all of its' greatness. One reason why I have such a passion for this book is because of the time era it is based in, the 1920s. This time period has always held a tender place in my heart because of the pure magic of it all. From the flappers to the music it has always fascinated me. So finding a piece of literature that includes an intriguing plot, superior writing techniques, and the 1920s all into a couple hundred pages is remarkable. I keep mentioning how Fitzgerald wrote and the brilliance of it, but let me explain. His use of rhetoric devices such as imagery and personification legitimately enhance this book for me as a reader. Gatsby was a millionaire, rich beyond belief, and he would through these illustrious parties every night. The imagery that is brought into place through Fitzgerald's writing intensify this illustration of these parties. The detail Fitzgerald is able to go into brings the reader into the story of Gatsby, only adding to the reader's experience. Another element as to why this book is such a classic is on account of the personification that is delivered to the readers. In fact, it is on the front of the book. The mysterious all seeing eye of the once eye doctor in the town that still stand there. Throughout the book he is referenced as the all seeing eye, even though it is only a mere poster. Fitzgerald personifies this old advertisement to symbolize God and his immortal sight and judgement. This use of personification intensifies and adds another layer to this classic piece of literature. "
1179,Arthur Grunenwald,"My first love.I read The Great Gatsby in early March 2014 on a one-week climb with my dad to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro. It was the first ""literary"" novel that I had read outside of my English class as a result of my newly-found passion for language. The only books I can recall reading before The Great Gatsby outside of school (excluding graphic novels) are Gary Paulsen's 
Hatchet
 and 
Guts: The True Stories behind Hatchet and the Brian Books
, neither of which has had any memorable impact on me.The Great Gatsby, however, caught me off-guard with its appetizer of just how deep the rabbit hole of literature can go.The Great Gatsby has been discussed a countless number of times in greater depth and on more specific topics by readers who are frustratingly better than I am, so it feels ambitious and even scary to give my thoughts on this ""Great American Novel"". Unfortunately, this is a belief shared by many students and scholars around the world who are ordered to analyze the The Great Gatsby. Even some of the greatest book reviewers in my friends list have not written reviews of the novel yet, possibly - though hopefully not - as a result! This idea of literary subordinate anxiety is a shame because all impressions of an artistic work are relevant; one of the many lessons discussing this book has taught me. Like the effect of Shakespeare's works on students, people tend to end up disliking The Great Gatsby as a result. What a waste. What a poor dismissal of a work with revolutionary and eminent impacts on literary history.Discussing profound and relevant themes in a captivating narrative, protagonist Nick Carraway recalls a summer spent in Long Island, New York as he interacts with the mysterious and now iconic Jay Gatsby. Fitzgerald, decades ahead of his time, creates a critique through this story of the corruption of the ""American Dream"", social classes, working classes, superficiality, hedonism, love, marriage, education, racism, sexism, familial roles, and more. Set in the ""Jazz Age"" or ""Roaring Twenties"" of post-WWI America, these themes could not have been more relevant. Unfortunately, Fitzgerald's criticisms remain relevant now, and likely will forever. This ability to discuss an amalgamation of diverse and relevant themes in so few pages is a sign of a great author, and furthermore, a great novel.As an anonymous poster elegantly said on /lit/ a few months ago: ""The Great Gatsby represents everything America loves. It's a redemption story about reclaiming a lost love. It's a story about a self-made man who faces off with a rich man who is not self-made. It's nostalgic about the past, and it's about a man who is a Quixotic idealist, and who ultimately dies pursuing what he wants. Oh, and it's set in New York City.""In retrospect, I should probably give The Great Gatsby a 4-star rating given that I've read other novels that I think are flat-out better and as a result set the bar higher for what a 5-star rating is. However, this book has become symbolic and nostalgic for my development as a reader and as a person. As such, I think it deserves its maximum rating. I couldn't have asked for a better start to my literary life."
1180,Kathryn,"Summary: Nick Carraway leaves his simple (though scandal prone) life in Chicago to move to the East coast. While there he re-engages his friends Tom and Daisy, falls for a golfer, and parties at his next-door neighbor's house. But this classic tale is an unrealized fantasy, and life is not quite as perfect as it seems on East Egg.Why I Read This Book: I had been itching to read it for a while, but I had my motivation increased when (a) John Green declared it his online book club choice and then (b) my staff book club decided to do it. Review: I loved it. Not only is the message timeless, the writing is beautiful. It's incredible. Modern books don't have the same je-ne-sais-quoi. A book needs that fifth element that makes it more than a good story, more than great characters, that fifth element that turns them into a piece of literature, and what I couldn't appreciate in this book when I read it at 16 was that fifth element. The lyrical passages and unusual imagery bring you to another world that is exactly like your own, but somehow dream-like - unrealistic, like Carraway was seeing the East Coast world around him. I have never been very good at symbolism, and I see the allegorical nature of the book, but its the language that drew me in, tossed me around, and spit me out.A few of my favorite passages:""I think that voice held him most, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn't be over-dreamed--that voice was a deathless song.""So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes."" ""She's got an indiscreet voice, ""I remarked. ""It's full of-"" I hesitated. ""Her voice is full of money,"" he said suddenly. That was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money--that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals' song of it...High in a white palace the king's daughter, the golden girl...""That's my Middle West--not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow."""
1181,Priscille Sibley,One sentence: Why did I wait so long to read this brilliant novel? 
1182,Susan Fike,I re-read this book every year while teaching it and it continues to amaze me. The writing is brilliant and the story will hook even the most reluctant reader. 
1183,Dan Brogan,"This was the best book I have ever read. This is the book that showed me that reading is cool, and is simply mesmerizing. This was the first book that I had to read for school that I actually enjoyed reading. The characters in The Great Gatsby are all wonderful. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a brilliant author, whose books are simply out of this world. Even though the book had little plot, most educated people would agree that plot is one of the less important aspects of a good book. His style of writing is so beautiful and articulate, I literally fell in love with this man's writing and inner beauty. Both F.Scott Fitzgerald and his wife,Zelda Fitzgerald are beautifully broken people, who were meant for each other,but eventually faded because of their deep-seeded emotional and alcohol problems. Overall, I loved the Great Gatsby. A book has never made me feel so emotional and beautiful in my life."
1184,Javiera,"Fitzgerald tiene una manera exquisita de narrar, sus metáforas son livianas pero significativas y le dan un nuevo sentido a la lectura. El personaje de gatsby es extraordinario, el aire de misterio que se le otorga le hace incluso más atractivo al momento de leer;y a pesar de la introducción que nick da en las primeras páginas, en ningún momento esperé que fuera una persona tan sentimental. Su amor a Daisy es enorme, y siento que ésta no se merece la gran atención y dedicación que nuestro protagonista le entrega.Leí en una reseña esta frase tan poeticamente adecuada a lo que pienso de esta lectura que no podía hacer menos que agregarla a mi reseña:""when a man wants to give you the world, the least you can do is send a flower to his funeral.""Gatsby en un magnífico personaje de los pocos que existen y gracias a él comprendo la fama de esta novela.El final es trágico pero bonito, nos muestra la realidad del Este y el desprecio de sus habitantes a todo lo no-superficial, y no sé, me dejó triste que ninguno de los concurrentes invitados de gatsby fuera a su funeral, triste triste.Este es un magnífico ejemplo de la grandeza de nuestros sueños más alocados."
1185,Johan Sandberg,"""I would leave just after the next to last song... and the film would just go on forever,"" Björk says in Dancer in the Dark referring to musicals in theaters. That was the exact feeling I had, when The Great Gatsby was about to end. A fantastic novel that, with the tools of language, penetrates parts of your feelings that you didn't know about. Whether or not it became a classic, this book definitely has something to tell - and I was blown away."
1186,Cinderluna twistedly beautiful,"i love the story but felt bad for Mr. Gatsby i would have them and left my jerk of a husband who was cheating on Daisy with a fat ugly cow, i hated the bitch so dam much.and i love the with leonardo dicaprio yummm..."
1187,Yurii,"A wonderful masterpiece of the American classic literature. I enjoy reading this traitorous story among Gatsby and Daisy. Nick is narrating the novel and characters of this story as a chronicles. In the beginning of this unusual book we met Nick Carraway. Nick is a charismatic character, we learned about his family origin including his cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom Buchanan. Daisy is not a fool herself but is the product of a social environment, to a great extent, does not worth intelligence in women. Tom is a rich, chauvinist pig and dislikes everyone except himself. Once Nick meets his neighbor Jay Gatsby, the story reveals about the past and the romance of Gatsby and Daisy."
1188,Kaoutar Ch,"Have you ever read a book that made you want to read it again and again, tell your friends about it, feel very proud of it, and read it one more time?? Have you ever had the chance to live a journey through a wonderful book ???The great Gatsby is That book . It makes you think you’re a part of someone’s life; you feel as if you’re an element of the events, you start believing that you’re sitting with the characters, listening to them talking, and they listen too. There is so much that have been said about this brilliant book; many reviews, and words that have been written about it. I think I don’t need to talk more about how amazing the book is ;)I was impressed by the events in the book, they made me want to know more… They made me wishing to be there. The characters – WOOOW- I really loved how the writer chooses the characters: they are different, charming in their own way, and I think each one of us can relate to one of them.When I think of Gatsby, I feel very sad and sorry for him, he wanted to have everything he thought he needed or wanted; and at the end, he did not have a thing: nor a person who truly cares about him ( with the exception of Nick , his neighbor ), and not even a person who just “pretends” to like him.Although I find it very interesting to do so, I did not want to focus on the political issues of the book, nor the issues of beginning of the 20th century. What I liked to focus on was the feelings of the characters, the way they think, and the differences they have. I really wanted to take a close look on how the Americans of this period lived, and how they interacted with each other. I loved how Fitzgerald uses his characters, the story, the events to draw an image of the American society.I’m very happy that I had the chance read it, and I really loved it. The book made me cry ( like really crying), specially at the end. I decides to read it one more time, and I started it yesterday.Beautiful extraordinary book, that I personally think each one of us should read more than once ;) :)"
1189,Alexis Norrvide,"One of the most boring books that I have ever read, and in the connotation that boring equates bad this is just wrong. The books has a tone of boring all through out it, I never felt super excited, not at least until the last couple of chapters, but then the rest simply is just plain, bland, nothing really extremely spectacular that made me turn the page very quickly. But do not let this boring tone put the book down at all. It's an excellent book for it gives us a great way to grasp the rich of the time. Their lives seem to have it all but boring they were, and despicable. It's a great work of art and truly one of my favorite books, it has many things which I did in fact enjoy and two chapters which were page turners but I never felt this book had that uplifting happy tone which did good for it. Oh and that green light!"

1192,Rachel Holton,The classic tale of the American Dream and unrequited love. I love everything about this book. The writing is gorgeous and the characters unforgettable.
1193,Bryanna Davila," The Great Gatsby is such a beautiful book . The way the words made you picture Gatsby and the way he looked. You felt the love he felt for Daisy. The Great Gatsby shows how a man would fight for a girl and even die for her. When they first met it was love st first sight. Daisy met someone else and married . She soon met with Gatsby and thats where the adventure begins. The chase for the love of Gatsby's life... The book is a wonderful love story about this man who throws these huge parties hoping Daisy would walk into one of them for them to meet and have a nice time. How he bought this castle to be his home just to live in front of Daisy across the lake. The green light across the lake was Gatsby's way of knowing she was there. I fell in love with the book, the movie i love the book so much. At the end Gatsby dies all after the chase of Daisy . He gets shot and dies waiting for Daisy's call ."
1194,Sylvia,"I did a re-read of this book because I haven't read it since High School. And, just as I remember, I love Fitzgerald's writing style. You can really feel the place and time of this story through his writing. And thus, through Caraway's narration of Gastby the reader is shown the decay of the American Dream in the 20's despite the lush excess of the era. "
1195,Giovanna,"I read this for high school. When we read it in our book group, I couldn't believe it--I had no memory of what a great book it is. Hmmm...perhaps I should revisit more of those assigned readings..."
1196,logdog,I liked it so much I rented the movie. I remember especially liking the eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg!
1197,Christopher Brown,"This book is simply beautiful. The writing, wow, the writing, how to even start to describe the writing. It's like a beautiful rich oil painting full of deep colours. Some of the passages were so affecting in the way Fitzgerald describes the scenes, or the characters, or the simple macabre atmosphere of what is happening. For example, the scene where Myrtle is hit by a car. Wow. I was physically shaking reading that. So powerful. Also, the characters, which are really very deep, unpredictable and utterly realistic. Then, there is the general mood of the book, where two-thirds of it I felt like a huge fog had descended on the whole of West Egg, which was just due to the incredible writing by Fitzgerald. The result is that you are left with a feeling of not quite understanding the characters/purpose/plot, not until right at the end. Can't wait to re-read it!"
1198,Tori Clare,"So I challenged myself to read one of the classics. I did this in the summer in advance of watching the new film. This is a late review. The Great Gatsby did what it said on the tin. It was great. Compelling? Yes, but short as it was, it needed to be absorbed and savoured, and so I took my time and read this bite-sized book in a week. I'm not going to lie and say that it was sleep-disturbing. I have some trouble relating to books from the past and the economic and social circumstances surrounding the themes. My imagination for such things isn't great and contemporary literature is always my first choice. That said, I loved the imagery, the language, the subtlety and the power of the words, said succinctly. There were many sentences I had to re-read just to enjoy the magic of a master writer at his best. I was in awe. Gatsby was an enigma to me for much of the book, and remained so to the tragic end. A memorable read that I couldn't award with less than full marks, but I was glad to return to the 21st century! "
1199,Brynne Shelton,THE GREAT GATSBY.MORE LIKE THE GREAT BOOK THAT DOESN'T END WELL FOR ANYONE.
1200,Paul Westwood,"The first time I read this I liked it but wasn't overly impressed for some reason. I don't know why because this time I really took the time to appreciate it and I can see now why it's seen as one of the greats of American literature.What makes it great for me is Fitzgerald's economy with words. Every sentence, every word, serves a purpose. There is nothing extraneous in the novel, it has been paired down to the core and what's left is a very simple novel that conveys so much in a short time. Every action within the novel very clearly progresses the plot but the descriptive passages serve a specific purpose too; they're not there to make something sound nice, or horrible, they're there to convey a mood or set you up for something that's to come later in the novel. And of course there's the closing sentence, a contradiction in terms that leaves the reader reeling in total empathy with the narrator and his disillusionment with society.If I have one criticism it is with the content than the way it's written. The narrator has such high regard for Gatsby, for his unfailing faith, and sees him as some bastion of honor and truth and yet a lot of Gatsby's past is less than honorable. He is involved in very shading dealings regarding his finances and even his aspirations to be so rich and famous go against everything that the narrator rails against. "
1201,Michael Leary,"This book is by far one of the favorite books that I have read though out high school. Taking place in the 20’s really shows what life was about and it portrayed the wealthy in a snobby way. This book is about chasing love and it shows that people will do anything to get the one who they truly love. Jay Gatsby chases his true love, but as a result he loses her to someone else and he ends up dead all because he let a lady drive. This is a fun book to read just because you don’t really know whats going to happen next and that is what makes a book good."
1202,Gadi,"I remember reading this during the Great Neckian night, feeling each one of Fitzgerald's words foam on my skin like a drop of dew, the chirps of the cicada filling the empty space around me, and then realizing the perfection with which Fitzgerald had described the place. The lackluster grasp of wealth; the richness of the night. I would bike down to the Point every now and then and look out into the pastures at Gatsby Lane. It seemed so immersing, the experience of living in the same place as the characters in one of your favorite novels—knowing the rhythm of the setting, each dark minutia of the place. Gatsby is as un-American a book as the Dream is an American concept. This yearning for beauty and wealth could never have been described in such a lulling way, a harrowingly, subtly beautiful way. It’s almost as if the West Egg is an island within Long Island, a small country of its own (and it almost seems like this today.) It’s so easy to see the West Egg as a microcosm of American society, where in fact it is the opposite: In America, wealth is worshipped, and it works—in the West Egg, even Gatsby knows his parties are a pretense.Like the rumors that the guests of Gatsby’s parties love so much, the novel challenges the outward appearance of people and demonstrates the tenuous relationship between reality and appearance in a variety of delicate ways. Everything here is a facade; everything creates tension between what is real and what we think is real. And like a facade, tension renders all appearances fragile as dreams. Through language, Fitzgerald conjured in me emotions that I have never felt before. It speaks of decaying beauty and shattered aspirations in such a delicate stream of metaphors and similies that...I can’t do this. It’s too good. "
1203,Susan,"The first (and only) time I'd read The Great Gatsby was in high school. But my oldest daughter read it for school and loved it, and of course the new movie has come out, and I wanted to read it again. My only memories of the book from 30 years ago were of giant eyes on a billboard that were symbolic in some way, the '20s, and something fishy (no pun intended) in the swimming pool at the end.I think I enjoyed the book more this time -- for the one or two of you who haven't read it yet, it's a tale set in the '20s about a mysterious man, Gatsby, and his interactions with his first love, Daisy, and a current neighbor, Nick. There's a lot more to it, though, and I think I enjoyed it more now simply because, having lived more of life, I can relate to more of the thoughts expressed in the book. A few I liked: ""Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that ... a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth."" ""(He was) one of those men of such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-climax."" ""There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams -- not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart."" ""... for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.""If you've ever had longings unfulfilled (and who among us hasn't?), you'll enjoy Gatsby."
1204,Charlie,"Like many other English Literature students, I had to read The Great Gatsby for college and after I had read some reviews on here about the book I was slightly dreading starting it.I opened the book and the first page just went straight over my head and it put me off reading it, so I went out on the open deck of the ferry I was travelling on and stood there in the middle of the open sea for a good half an hour to breathe some fresh air and clear my mind.When I went back to my seat, I opened the book again and managed to read the entire first chapter in around 15 minutes. To my surprise, I enjoyed it and subsequently read the whole book over my 3 day holiday to the Isle of Man. The Great Gatsby is often described as being boring as ""nothing happens"", however if you read into the context of the book you begin to see that in reality, quite a lot happens.Jay Gatsby is an amazing character, and like Nick I was fascinated by him, and I'm sure you will be too. I strongly advise anyone to read this book because it gives you a taste of what 'The Roaring Twenties' were like."
1205,K,This just makes you want to prance around in pretty little flapper dresses while binge drinking Mint Juleps. I loved this book and am currently re-reading. Funny how you realize that you didn't understand a thing when begrudgingly reading this for a high school English course!
1206,Matt Giddens,Favorite Book ever...
1207,Sandy Shen,"
The Great Gatsby
By: F. Scott Fitzgerald ! Alert ! Spoilers !
Plot
Overall, an interesting take on the whole idea of affairs and whatnot. It was interesting to not be in the main character's head 100% of the time, and it was nice to have a rather objective view on the entire thing. However, I would've liked Nick to have a bit more of a spine, but I think that would've interfered with the flow of the story.
Setting
The whole setting really makes it a great story. Fitzgerald's descriptions and depictions of the scenery was decadent and flawless in a glorious manner, and I'm not complaining. His descriptions of the view and the little subtleties hidden in every page and place made the whole book a complicated yet gorgeous story to untangle. I loved rereading it, and I never got tired of it, even when it tended to drag on, or when the shallowness and indecisiveness of Daisy irked me. Going back to the little subtleties, the setting added signifying little things in Gatsby's and Daisy's relationship that made it all... wrong. Not only was it adultery, but it wasn't meant to be. The East and the West Eggs, the little body of water separating, the ever-present social before from before and even after. Overall, a definite homerun for me.
Characters
Daisy first, because she left that much of an impact on me. Sure, she can be incredibly irritating sometimes, but she is overall a very interesting and complicated character. Some of her actions can be as predictable as a instruction manual, but some as unexpected as a glitch in your favorite app. She's got to be one of the greatest yet questionable mothers out there: one minute she's saying some of the most mothering woman of all time, wishing absolute happiness for her child in one of the most judgmental and shallow societies of her time, and the next, off fooling around with Gatsby. But everything is sugar-coated with Gatsby's bias and Nick's misinterpretation of her character, as in reality she is a selfish fool who's character is, well, not the best. However, I love the idea of her. A sweet, foolish, kind, and the kind of girl that gives you a sense of sweet nostalgia whenever you think of her. The kind to make a man like Gatsby mad.  For Gatsby, there's a lot to be said. He's super shady, and one of the most idolizing, foolish, and idiotic man I've ever read about. He's the kind of man who dies early in tragic teen novels and is always flinging himself into disastrous situations because he's, ""blinded by love."" While Gatsby doesn't exactly fling himself in front of oncoming cars like in korean dramas, he does manage to stir up some conflicts and become infatuated and drunk with passion that he confronts Tom with Daisy, and forces her to choose between him and Tom. Sadly, things don't go his way, and we're left with Nick's bewildered thoughts and Gatsby's crushed being. Gatsby, himself, is very admirable, but more so like a fallen hero. He's worked so hard to prove that he's changed since before, when he was a poor boy and he and Daisy were just a teenage couple in love. He wants so badly to prove that he's grown up, and that they can go back to before, where everything was sweet and a never-ending dream. But he's so invested in the past that he can't look up and realize how terrible of a hole he's fallen into, full of shallow people, meaningless objects, money, and illegal things. He couldn't let go of his past, but the people of his past had long moved on and given up. Nick Carraway: yes, he comes before Tom. But there's not an immense amount I have to say about "
1208,Kevin Ngo,"You don't need to have someone to give you the green light to read this. It's great, but just don't have unreal expectations about it."
1209,Spencer,"	The Roaring 20s in America was the time of money in excess. In The great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald tells of the rich and luxurious lifestyle of NewYork during this time period. His protagonist, Gatsby, is mysterious flashy aristocrat. The plot centers around Gatsby’s forbidden love with Daisy Buchanan. This world famous story set in the Jazz age portrays the emotional rollercoaster of love triangles, feuds, and betrayal. The love story within this book is widely considered to be one of the greatest, but most tragic love stories of all time. 	F. Scott Fitzgerald is one of the most famous writers of all time mostly due to the wide belief that The Great Gatsby in one of the best books ever written. Although this book thought to be one of the best books of all time, it still has a few flaws. One of these flaws is Fitzgerald’s unnessicerily long or obscure vocabulary probably due to the setting of the book being in the 20’s. At times this vocabulary made this book very difficult to follow along with. One example of this is the word egg. “Egg”(5), in the 20s, was a widely used word to describe the wealthy. Another example is when one of the main characters, Myrtle, describes her feelin for her husband. She says “’Crazy about him!’ She cried Incredulously’ who said I was crazy about him?” ”(35). Without knowing the meaning of the word incredulous which is, unwilling to believe something, it is hard know that Myrtle is conveying that she can’t believe people think that she is crazy for him. Another important theme in this book is simply the Roaring 20s themselves. This book gives amazing detail concerning what life was like for the wealthy back then. It described parties, homes, and simply the lavish lifestyle of the West Egg aristocrats. Every weekend Gatsby throws famous crazy parties to lour Daisy back to him. These parties were extravagant and had ""At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas tree I'd Gatsby's enormous garden “(40). This tell the reader about just how extravagent his party's are. This book is also quite famous because within such an extravagent lifestyle, is a deep darkness. This darkness is greed and its effects on love. When Gatsby was young, he fell in love with Daisy, but had to go to war and leave her. Soon she was married to Tom and Gatsby was left all alone without his true love. To make it even more complicated, they began a new love affair, but when Daisy found out that Gatsby wasn't as successful as she thought she left for Tom again. This proves that Gatsby's true love was Daisy, but Daisy's true love was wealth. Overall I really enjoyed this book and I especially enjoyed how deep the book was. "
1210,Patty,"E' uno dei romanzi più straordinari che io abbia letto finora.Non si può non rispecchiarsi in Nick, l'io narrante, e non provare una certa empatia per Gatsby, l'ideale del sogno americano, l'uomo nato dal nulla e fattore del proprio destino. Il sogno americano: la promessa del futuro, a differenza di noi vecchi europei che abbiamo un passato con cui dobbiamo continuamente confrontarci. E infatti ""Il grande Gatsby"" acquista valenza di universalità proprio quando incarna l'illusione di realizzare il sogno. I sogni sono puri finchè c'è il desiderio, etereo, evanescente che li renderli grandi. Ma i sogni sono ideali perfetti e quando si cerca di sovrapporli a una realtà, che per sua natura è imperfetta, incompleta, in continuo divenire, il sogno si distrugge e spesso trascina nel suo vuoto lo stesso autore.C'è un'immagine in questo romanzo che resterà senz'altro per sempre nel mio immaginario: il colore verde.Verde, come ci dice lo stesso Fitzgerald, è il colore dell'America, così come la videro gli europei che vi sbarcarono per la prima volta; verde è il colore dei dollari; è il colore del""via libera"", del permesso di partire.Verde è la luce che illumina il pontile della casa di Daisy. Quando Nick incontra Gatsby per la prima volta, lo vede solo nell'oscurità con le braccia protese verso quella luce verde, in direzione dell'estremità del molo dove era la casa di Daisy, quasi ad abbracciare idealmente il sogno di tutta la sua vita.Ed empaticamente, anche noi, come Gatsby siamo incapaci di resistere al richiamo della luce verde.."
1211,Pardis,توصيه ميكنم اول كتاب رو بخونيد و بعد حتما فيلمشو ببينيد. من كه واقعن از هر دوتاش لذت بردم.
1212,Mary Beth Gibson,"My niece assured me I could read all of The Great Gatsby on my flight from Philadelphia to Columbia, SC. The plane pulled up to the terminal with four pages left to read.I had seen the 1974 movie starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow, but as is often the case, I found the book so much deeper and more profound. First, the lifestyle of the uber-wealthy in the Twenties was set in the first forty-seven pages before we even confronted the mysterious character of Jay Gatsby. It was clear that despite the massive, beautiful homes, servants, and leisure time, the lives of the rich on Long Island were vacuous and, to me, boring. That explains the draw of neighbor, Gatsby’s, spectacular parties. We learn later through the narrator, Nick Carraway, that the galas were merely a way for Jay Gatsby to find his way back into the life of his first love, Daisy Buchanan (Nick’s cousin). I won’t give away the story, but suffice it to say, the simple devotion of Jay Gatsby slams into a world where the lifestyle and prestige that money brings has a powerful grip of its own. One of my fascinations with the book comes from the fact that F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote this novel in 1925, in the midst of the “Roaring Twenties.” To me, the lives of the characters exuded emptiness, and it is amazing that Fitzgerald exposed this before the Crash of 1929, while he, his wife, and the rest of America were enmeshed in this lifestyle. On a side note, I was struck by the racism of the day and how we can see remnants of it even now. Tom Buchanan, the husband of Gatsby’s beloved Daisy, says in conversation, “The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.” He adds, “It’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.”There are disparaging remarks about Jews as well, which are striking when you think the Holocaust is years in the future. It reminded me that eugenics (the “science” that expounds the superiority of some races over others) was embraced during this time, and was not really discredited until after Hitler’s atrocities.All in all, I found the book thought-provoking, with much to say to us now in our materialistic culture."
1213,Shilpa,"I have been reading classics lately and the first thing that I can say about this book is it's imagery,the beautiful flowing of the language,the description of the imaginary West Egg/East Egg not to leave behind the decaying and losing morality of The Great American dream where it's money that calls the shots and the charcters are not perfect but duly marked with their own shades of grey.All said and done,I have a certain problem with the characters portrayed here.Lets start with Nick,the investment banker who after returning from the war was too restless and looking forward to learn the bond business,finds abode sandwiched between the sprawling acres of the rich in West Egg one of which belongs to the Great Gatsby.I like his observation of the characters around him.His description of their beauty and their flaws,their distractions that speak of their attraction and obeisance to the material world,their lack of depth and characters at certain times and how superficial the definition of love is for some people.Nick Carraway is in awe of Gatsby's wealth.He hasn't met his neighbour and when he goes to one of the countless parties Gatsby throws he finds himself wondering the entire fuss,pretention and the meaningless of it.Comes to meet Gatsby personally and finds himself in an odd position where Gatsby asks of him to invite Daisy and himself at Nick's place and to be secretive about it.Gatsby who had been in love with Daisy(Nick's cousin)even before the story starts and has been accumulating all this wealth in a hopeless and tragic pursuit of being good enough for her.Does he even realise in his blindness that she is already married? What kind of love is this that leads to obsession,total lack of morals just for the sake of accetance and social perception?It's a message for the society that accepts people for what they have rather than what they are.Next comes Daisy Buchanan who is as self-centered as anyone can be.She is at the center of attraction with two men fighting over her and that too when she is already married and has long ago given up on love having chosen wealth and a comfortable Life over that.My question is whether she really is looking for love or is Jay Gatsby(and his millions)another way to one-up her social status. She has no problem being unfaithful to her husband.I wonder what her decision would have been had Gatsby not owned as much wealth as he did.Would she have still felt the same for him ?She admires his home,his beautiful shirts and so widely depicts her shallowness when she fails to own up for running over her husband's mistress and going away for yet another one of her fancy trips letting Gatsby take the entire onus of that.What love,huh ?This book has to be read and re-read in order to fully capture the essence of the beauty that it has to offer,not in terms of what it says but how it says it.It certainly is a masterpiece in prose. A must read!"
1214,Ari Hernandez," I chose to read ""The Great Gatsby,"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald because my mom told me that she read this book when she was in school, and that it was a pretty good book. There were two differen't covers to this book. One had the actual cover from when it was published, and the other had the actors from the movie on it. After reading the back I thought,""I must read this!"" When i read the book I kind of disliked how Gatsby perssured Daisy so much to tell Tom she didn't love him. But, besides from that I liked every event that occured in the book. When Nick was introduced I thought he was an interesting character. At first I didn't really like Daisy. But, as you read more you got to know more about her. I like Jordan becasue she knew about how Daisy changed her mind about marrying Tom. My least favorite characters were Myrtyle and Tom. It upset me that Tom was with other women and Daisy knew, and that Daisy didn't want to believe it. After two-thirds of the way through the book I felt like you were learning more and more about how at some point Daisy would have to really think about telling Tom she didn't love him. When the author made Daisy make that decision I thought what is gonna be Tom's reaction to that?  I finished the book and now it is one of me favorite books. I actually can't even think of any strengths or weaknesses. The book was just that awesome. This book should be recomended to everybody, it doesn't matter who they are. They just have to read this book! "
1215,Corbin Riecks,"With a very interesting plot concerning the great time of The Roaring Twenty’s, an admired, mysterious character in the form of Jay Gatsby, and convenient length of 180 pages, it’s easy to see why The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a story beloved by many. The book follows the likes of Nick Carroway, a young man who has moved to Long Island to sell bonds in Manhattan. Nick’s house is next to a huge mansion, and Nick is fascinated by the millionaire owner of the house, Jay Gatsby. Gatsby throws huge parties at his mansion where anybody who’s anybody comes. Nick is invited to one of these parties, and meets Jay Gatsby. The two become friends after sharing World War I stories. One day, it is revealed to Nick that Gatsby is in love with Nick’s cousin, Daisy. Daisy and Gatsby met before Gatsby was sent off to war. Gatsby believes there is still something between him and Daisy and asks Nick to help him get her back. The only problem is, Daisy is married to a man named Tom Buchanan. Despite this, Jay is able to win Daisy over and the two begin to have an affair. The rest of the book involves the problems that arise through the affair. My favorite aspect of the book is the physiological aspects of the great Jay Gatsby. One of the biggest questions throughout the whole book is how Gatsby was able to make his fortune. Gatsby tells Nick that he attended Oxford college and that his wealth was made through inheritance. When Jay tells Nick this, Nick finds the story to be unbelievable. Later, we find that Gatsby has made his money through organized crime, which is foreshadowed when we meet the man who fixed the 1919 World Series (Go White Sox). Gatsby actually grew up as a poor farm boy. Gatsby’s life is a symbolism of the American dream in contrasting the idea whether or not any person can “make it in America” no matter what background. I found The Great Gatsby to be a fantastic read, with a great plot and characters while also having multiple scenarios for analysis. (363) "
1216,Justine,"Beautiful, tragic, and moving. A story of unflinching love and devotion, friendship, and how wealth will never equate to happiness. Such a masterpiece. Definitely one of the best classics I have ever read."
1217,Ina,"I started this book with no real expectations, I started it because I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie. I didn't have a big notion of the plot, nothing. All I knew was Gastby was rich, loved Daisy, who was not available but loved him back.The first half passed by me with no real notion of what happened. Nick, (who I constantly forgot the name of because Gatsby never calls him anything but ""Old Sport) was the neighbor of Gatsby, who's super rich and fabulous and mysterious and lonely. He has a lot of people he hangs out with, but he doesn't enjoy their company that much. Then Gatsby reveals he has loved Daisy for the past 5 years. Okay. That's cool, no shock there. We all knew it was coming. His big persona vanishes and he becomes a twelve year old trying to talk to a girl he likes.  No Old Sport, she's got to come to your house because it's too forward of me to do it at my house, Wow Old Sport, your house kinda sucks compared to mine, here, let me help, I want her to think good of us, Oh, Old Sport, what do I say, I love her, old sport, old sport old sport old sport DAISY WOW SHE'S BEAUTIFUL OLD SPORT  Nick, like a good friend, helps him out. Problem is, she's married to a complete jerk of a guy who's testosterone levels are so high you can smell them from a mile away. It also doesn't help that she's a complete ditz. Every girl in the book, apart from Jordan (who's actually pretty cool) is so ditzy, I can't help but dislike every one of them. They're whiney, don't do anything, completly relying on the man, flirtatious (which I can take, but seriously now stop flirting THAT much) etc. I nicknamed her Ditzy Daisy because I could not stand her!Anyway, Old Sport gets it together and just kinda helps them come together, and they kick it off right away. Gatsby is a lovestruck 12- year old puppy, Daisy is her ditzy self but while gazing adorably at Gastby and also intimidated by her crazy bully husband. Her husband immediately knows what's up, seeing this handsome rich dude with his wife and them being totally smitten together, tries to keep them apart but Gatsby politely drives around them with a little help form Daisy. They confess their love to her husband, but in a battle of testosterone, she's only allowed to love one person her whole life while the other is absent.Speaking of driving, then Ditzy Daisy hits this woman with Gatsby's car because she's going too fast and can't drive. Maybe she was looking adoringly at Gatsby, who knows, but now this poor woman is a splatter on the street and more than one life is ruined pretty well. Oh, and their car, which seems really nice, can never be used again. Old Sport tries to get Gatsby to leave for a bit, y'know, because the husband of Mrs.Roadkill thinks it's him, because apparently people can see the faces of who's in a speeding car while their wife was bleeding out but not who was in the driver's seat. (Hint: it takes place in America) But Gatsby refuses to leave until he knows poor Daisy is okay, who, according to Gatsby, seems to be taking the fact that she ripped this woman open and that Gatsby is taking the blame. The husband of Mrs. Roadkill is, of course, hell bent on revenge, and offs Gatsby in the pool, before offing himself. I can't believe I did not know that Gatsby died! I can not believe that, in all this time, nobody has spoiled the story for me! I did one of these things, ('scuse the language)and re-read it because I wasn't even sure what had happened. (It also says they walked back with Gatsby so I'm not unjustified)I was actually really happy he died, not because I didn't like the character, I liked him a lot. He's trying for the best of times, like anyone would, and worked his way to the top. He's not a jerk, he's pretty cool. But yes, these are how love stories are supposed to go. They're not happy. They're tragic. It's not ""and then the lived happily ever after in their big house and everything was perfect."" Life isn't like that. ""But this, this is far more intimate. This is your heart. And you should never let it rule your head. You could have chosen any random number and walked out of here today with everything you worked for. But you just couldn't resist it, could you? I've always assumed that love is a dangerous disadvantage. Thank you for the final proof."" - Sherlock (BBC) ^ This quote, right here, is a lot of what I took from the book. ^ Love makes you blind, which leads to consequences. Reality is harsh and more often than not, innocent people take the fall for the guilty. So then Old Sport is devastated, and Gatsby's dad and old librarian come to his funeral, and only them, because, despite Old Sport's attempts, nobody cared for Gatsby. Not even Daisy. They were busy, his house was too far away, etc. Oh, but not for his parties, that's totally okay.It's all about money. That's how life is. People loved him because he had money, Daisy loved him when he had money, not when he was broke. Even when she first met him, he had pretended he was rich. Only Old Sport really cared for him for who he is. But you know, that's life. Gatsby is life. It's terrible and lonely, with a happy moment, and you strive to get to relive the happy moments. People come to you for what you have, not who you are, and no matter what you do for others, no matter how many terrible things you take, what you do for others, it's shot down, and it's revealed that nobody cares after all, it's just one big lie. But yet, you still live to try to climb to your happy moment.I think it's actually the most down to earth thing I've ever read. "
1218,Lesa Parnham,"I read this book because it is in my top 5 favorites of all time and I am VERY wary of going to the movie. A lot of times the movie just ruins books for me. I am still not sure... I like the actors they chose, I can see them in the roles that they play, but still...So many touching lines in this masterpiece, especially the last.Friends, what do you think, movie or no movie?Does anyone else feel this way about books and their adaptations?BTW: I did see the first movie with Robert Redford, but this was when I was a kid, before I read the book for the first time.READ AGAIN: 2015 Every time I read this book I find nuances that i didn't see before. This time I read it after reading ""So We Read On"" by NPR's book critic Maureen Corrigan. While she pointed out some things from the original book that I didn't see before, and I agree that this book should be read by grown-ups not high school kids. I kind of wish i would have seen them first. One of the only books that I can remember of the Jazz Age between World War one and World War 2. I will continue to read this book over and over. along with To Kill A Mockingbird, in my opinion, they are the two greatest examples of American fiction.DISCLAIMER: IF YOU LOOK AT MY BOOK REVIEWS IT LOOKS LIKE I READ THEM ALL IN THE SAME DAY, IMPOSSIBLE, JUST CATCHING UP ON THE OLD PEN AND PAPER LIST."
1219,Colleen,"I know this is one of those books they make you read when you're in high school, but personally I'm glad I never did, never had to answer mindless questions or write unnecessary essays about it. I could just enjoy it, think about it, live in it, & experience it. What a fantastic, timeless piece of art. I'm eager to read more Fitzgerald if his prose & characters are anything like these. "
1220,Forrest,"A crushingly poignant work. Now, I ""get it"", whereas when I read this as a teenager, I didn't. As a child, I was so bent on loving the anti-heroes that I missed the tragedy, the squandered possibilities, not within Gatsby, but within everyone else. As I read it, Gatsby isn't really the hero or the anti-hero at all. He is a hub around which the real stories churn. He is a soft, vulnerable, naive, ambitious machine. And while everything and everyone revolves around him, he is, in the end, abandoned, though not forgotten, by all but a few. But the real question remains, just who have they abandoned? And in remembering him, are Jordan, Tom, Daisy, Wolfsheim and others creating a man that was never really there? Gatsby is like a raw onion at the dinner table. The center of attention both because of his ability to flavor any dish and because of his stink. But to focus on the raw onion in the middle of the table is to miss the delectable dishes that compose the rest of the meal.Fitzgerald knows how to pull at the heartstrings. I thought back to friends and girlfriends of long ago, situations, not the same, but similar to those of many of the characters that I've seen either in my own life or in the lives of those close to me. This book has a way of causing you to delve down behind the bookshelves of your mind and pull out those long-mangled scraps of paper, some of which you have been looking for for a long time, some of which you'd rather just forget.The writing herein is beautiful. I'll leave with one admittedly (and indulgently) long quote, which speaks to the beauty of the work, as well as the feeling that Fitzgerald gives the reader of continuously being placed on the edge of an emotional precipice overlooking a drop to the ocean, hundreds of feet below. It's exhilarating, thrilling really, and quite, quite dangerous.About half way between West Egg and New York the motor-road hastilyjoins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as toshrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley ofashes--a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges andhills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses andchimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcendent effort, ofmen who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, givesout a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-greymen swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloudwhich screens their obscure operations from your sight.But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which driftendlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue andgigantic--their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers onwaiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half anhour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute and it wasbecause of this that I first met Tom Buchanan's mistress."
1221,Jose Ruiz,"The concepts of wealth, time, and mystery are shown throughout The Great Gatsby. I can truly say that for a second time reading this book, I have realized the important details and foreboding placed at the beginning of the book. Gatsby yearns for the past and to do that he uses what's values in the 1920's the most: wealth."
1222,Devin,"This book, written during the roaring twenties defines the major changes America is goin through during this era. No longer are women oppressed as they were in the past. A new generation of women called Flappers come about and Daisy symbolizes just that. Gatsby pours his money out to impress Daisy and win her over, but Daisy's loyalty to her husband Tom is too strong and she denies her love for Gatsby during a confrontation. This book has a lot of interesting and dramatic events that can be linked with real events like the 1919 World Series. Gatsby is a symbol of an unachieved American Dream as he is killed towards the end of the book."
1223,Alun Baker,"Having read a few F. Scott Fitzgerald books almost out of duty, I picked this up with a degree of trepidation. It is a work of literary art, Fitzgerald transports you back in time to the 20's with a book and main characters that are both caught up in the wild release of that period but blended with the nagging self doubt and retrospection about their own personal realities and truths that makes this one of those timeless classics that everyone should read. "
1224,Sylvia Snow,È quasi impossibile scrivere una recensione che non sia positiva per un libro come questo. Purtroppo ho letto una versione ridotta di The Great Gatsby (maledette edizioni scolastiche in inglese!) e vorrei aver avuto il tempo necessario per apprezzare di più il libro e i suoi personaggi. 5 stelle!
1225,Tom,"I must be going through a reread phase. I suspect I may get to Jane Eyre before the end of the year.Anyway, Fitzgerald's masterpiece concerns the seduction of wealth, along with the corruption of it. Nick Caraway, the narrator, is well-off but not rich. Most of the people he associates with are. He does say early on he is one of the few truly honest people he knows, though a later accusation from short term love interest Jordan Baker suggests that isn't true either. This is a book about liars. Tom Buchanan lies about his morals and actions (he would take his wife's cousin to meet his mistress early on), his wife Daisy will lie about her affections (if they even are that deep), and the title character Gatsby will lie by omission about where his money comes from.Of course, the book ends tragically for Gatsby. No matter how much he earns, legally or otherwise, he will never be the same class as Tom or Daisy, and the whole West-Egg-New-Money vs. East-Egg-Old-Money clash will not be going away anytime soon. Gatsby is treating wealth and status according to things owned. Tom and Daisy care just as much (as much as they care about anything) about who a person was, and not just for legal purposes. They are, as Nick notes late in the book, careless people who destroy lives and barely notice. Money can't buy happiness or restore the past, and the sooner someone realizes it, the better that he or she can jump back to the West (wherever that is, the geography is a bit vague here) and be done with it."
1226,Kaeleigh Forsyth,It's kind of weird how we still make 16-year olds read this. Is it not weird? Seems weird!
1227,Christopher Quintana,"Such a great piece of classic American literature. I read this as a ""challenge book"" for school and it was truly amazing. It had the right amount of glamour, scandal, and mystery that every book needs. The thing I most enjoyed was seeing character development throughout the whole story. At the beginning you are unfamiliar with the majority of the characters and you often wonder who is this Gatsby. However as the story progresses you can see how their personalities have changed, some for the worse and others for the better. Although it is a short read, it's quite hefty and there is quite a bit to reflect on at the end of each chapter. Mr. Fitzgerald did a phenomenal job writing this book, he was able to let me imagine the images so clearly. Now after reading, I think I should watch the movie and compare the two. "
1228,Eenders,"I loved this book from the first page to the last. This is one of my alltime favorite books. I really liked the plot and the characters. For example, I liked how Gatsby was described as being mysterious and rich. The book has some really good parts that make the experience unforgettable. Like the parts when Gatsby meets Daisy for the first time since he left. What I like most about the book are the messages that the book has for you. The story has really good lessons attached to it that are worth reading. I love the symbols used in the book and I love what they teach you. The movie for this book is good and it showing everything in the book but you have to read the book first. I would recommend reading this book because of how good it was to read and because of what I learned from reading this wonderful book."
1229,Cami Lorusso,"El primer libro, La selección, me encantó. Creo que hasta le puse un 5 en la reseña. Me atrapó, me enamoró. Con la Elite pasó lo mismo, tal vez América me cansó un poco con todos sus vaivenes, pero en este libro me artó.Es una excelente personaje, es fuerte, madura, independiente, honesta, humilde. Pero el que use a Aspen tanto tiempo, el que no termine de decidirse hasta casi el final, terminó por dejarme nerviosa.En Maxon se ve una evolución grata, una muy buena evolución en pensamiento, actitud, determinación. Como en Aspen, ya no es el mismo, es otro, pero uno mejor.De verdad todos los personajes han madurado hasta en las 4 finalistas se ven la verdadera cara, salen las máscaras, nos conocemos por fin!.Jay Gatsby es un hombre rico, pero con un pasado complicado, difuso, duro. Gatsby es el envidiado de todos, el que todos quieren ser, es un hombre de plata, de gran poder. Pero el hace todo por una razón, siempre es así, ¿no?. Gatsby hace las mejores fiestas en todo Estados Unidos, Así que cada día hay fiesta en la casa, grandes fiestas, desborde de gente, alcohol, promiscuidades.Seguí leyendo en: http://disfrutando-the-vita.blogspot...."
1230,Cora,"Before I read this book, the only comments I heard about it were negative. I wouldn't say I was so much as forced to read it in my eleventh grade English class as I was willing to read it. I actually really enjoyed it. I may not have connected on a emotional level with the characters, but I definitely appreciated them. The book is told from Nick's perspective, which gives the plot an ambiguous sort of feeling. We don't really know how Daisy or Jay feels, which makes the book, in my opinion, a page turner. When asking why people don't like this book, I quickly found out that a lot of them hate the rising action. It takes a while for the plot to really kick into high gear, but I couldn't disagree more. I found it intriguing from the moment I first started reading it. The symbols are deep. The book has interesting characters and an interesting plot at that. While I was hoping the ending would have been a little different, I knew it wasn't going to turn out how I wished it would. That was okay with me too, because I realize that happy endings don't always happen. Some may find the book boring and depressing, but I, on the other hand, see it as a great piece of literature that I can really appreciate in my coming years. I also can't wait for the remake of the movie! "
1231,Niles," Scribner, 1925, 480 pp., $9.00 ISBN 0-684-80152-3The Great GatsbyF. Scott Fitzgerald	1922, New York is booming. Nick Carraway is in the center of it all. He came to New York to sell bonds, but when he meets Jay Gatsby it all changes.	Nick lives in West Egg, New York in a small house. His cousin Daisy lives just across the bay with her husband, Tom. When they get together for tea Nick is told a man who goes by Gatsby lives next door to him. Nick is later invited to one of Gatsby's parties. All the famous and rich from New York come to Gatsby's. Nobody there seems to really know who this Gatsby really is. Nick just hears multiple rumors about him. Finally Nick meets Gatsby for himself, a young man in his mid thirties. Gatsby is a mysterious and articulate man who has endless amounts of money. They soon become friends. Gatsby asks one simple favor of Nick. He wants Nick to invite Daisy over alone for tea. When she sees Gatsby, she falls in love. Nick is soon to learn that Daisy and Gatsby have had a long history together. They had planned to get married but when Gatsby joined the war she didn't have the patience to wait. They soon become deep into their love affairs again but there is one problem, Daisy is married and has a daughter. From here their love for each other becomes stronger and stronger until one day it all goes wrong.	I like The Great Gatsby because it is slightly mysterious what is really going on. It also expresses love and hope through the characters emotions and their extreme actions. F. Scott Fitzgerald shows what it is like to be living in the early twenties as a rich young person by creating moments in the book where you feel as if you are right there experiencing what is really happening. Some of the main themes in this book are hope, lost love, and determination. The characters are set on following their dreams, the author shows this by hinting at the characters dreams and showing their obscure things they do to follow their dreams. I also like how the author used very precise dialogue to enhance the mood and pace of the book. One of my favorite parts in the book is when Gatsby tells Nick who he really is. Nick is very surprised by what he has done. But is it actually the truth?	I recommend this book to girls and boys over ten years old. If you like to experience the past and like deep romance this is the perfect book for you. The Great Gatsby is a historical fiction write by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It shows what the 1920s culture was for rich New Yorkers. I fell deep into this complex love story and felt as if I was Nick.~Niles Wertz "
1232,Andd Becker," How could anyone NOT like this book? The writing is extraordinary, the plot riveting, the characters unforgettable. There is the dispassionate narrator; the obsessed Gatsby; the flighty lady; the philandering husband; the mistress-caught-up-in-a-dream; the gossamer partygoers flitting from one light amusement to another. And in the end there is -- just the narrator, haunted and forever changed, just as the reader is."
1233,Kecia,"Oh that green light. The image of Gatsby trembling and reaching for the green light is so outstandingly beautiful. The green light may represent something different to everyone, but we all have a green light and that's what makes Gatsby so very human.If I were stranded on a desert island and could only have one book...this would be the one! Since high school I have read it about 4 times and it gets better everytime. I vividly recall reading it in high school. Sitting on my bed in my parents home...and all the chemicals in my brain simply exploding!!! I understood then that this is what a great novel was all about. I was too young to fully understand it, it took subsequent readings for that, but Gatsby turned me into a lover of literature.Gatsby is THE greatest American novel."
1234,Damon Henrichs,"I read this because mydaughter had to read itfor school, and I had not read it since . . . well since I was her age.Really enjoyed it this time around (I doubt I would have given it 5 stars when I was 16 . . . ). The whole ""America is rich and evil"" theme is certainly overplayed out today, but of course this practically the original.I won't go into all the typical reviews etc (we did that in HS right?) but I WILL say a little tidbit that took me aback that most of us won't remember. At the end Nick goes to see Gatsby's ""mentor"" Wolfsheim at an office called ""The Swastika Holding Company"". WTF? I flipped back to check the publishing date thinking (correctly) that this had been written well prior to the rise of Nazi Germany.Yup, published in 1925. It's just a weird ironic quirk (the Swasika was used by many groups prior to the Nazis with no sinister meaning at all prior to the rise of the National Socialist Party. I wonder in hindsight what Fitzgerald would have made of this? Wolfsheim is no sympathetic character (Fitzgeralds one dimensionaly portrayal of him is arguably anti-semitic even), but it is certainly jarring to see a jewish person represented by a swasktika. I guess I don't really have a comment on that . . . other than it certainly took me by surprise."
1235,Aisha_a_514,"The Great Gatsby is a 1925 American novel written by one of the greatest fiction authors of all time F.Scott Fitzgerald . Its one those rare literature pieces that charms you with their elegant use of language and the outstanding yet beautiful word choices, The authors description is so vivid and intensely detailed that it zones you out of your world and right into theirs .You cant deny the fact that it's a classical romance story , but one that shows all different classes inside ones community , how some one can try so hard to live what seems to be the perfect life or what others can describe as the ( American Dream ) This story of love and loss shows how superficial,shallow and hallow some dreams are, running after them and working so hard to achieve while in the end all they find it to be is a mirage. The green light behind the mist in the story symbolizes your dream and what would you give in-order to achieve your dreams . For me it was a story that dealt with hate , love , betrayal , faith ,loss, truth and lie its a mix up between evil and good . "" I Dare you not to fall in love with the novel "" they said ... but let me just say that i didn't only fall in love with it as it have blown me away."
1236,Connor,"The Book ""The Great Gatsby"" is written by F.Scott Fitzgerald and is a fictional drama novel. Imagine a life filled with corrupt business men, fame, fortune, and heartbreak. This is the life of the one and only, Jay GatsbyThe Great Gatsby is set back in 1950's New York and focuses on the life of Jay Gatsby, or ""The Great Gatsby"". It shows how all of his money, his success, and his lavish life style mean nothing to him, and how it was all inspired by love and heartbreak. The story is told from the memory of Gatsby's Neighbor Nick Carraway, a stock man who moved to New York to work at the New York Stock Exchange. What really stuck out in this book was the plot. It's twisted, intriguing, and very shady. It keeps you interested throughout the entire book, and keeps you on edge. It has a way of sucking you in and not letting you leave. I think this book is a great read. It was confusing, dark, exciting, and incredibly well written. I would recommend this book to anybody because this book is an incredible read and i think anybody would like it"
1237,Elizabeth Pratt,"Wow! So, this book absolutely blew my mind. I said it was simple, and easy to follow in one of my mid book updates, but when you finish the book, Fitzgerald wraps things up so expertly that its genius. All the little things he included, that you didn't think were going to be a big deal, actually play a huge part in the story and you realize that the moment you finish the book. That is what blew my mind.Now that I've had time to think about it, I despise Daisy. At first I just felt sorry for her, but now that I've really thought about it, I've realized she's extremely fickle and Nick's famous 'Daisy and Tom were selfish people etc' quote made Daisy's flaws all the more clear to me.I read this book for my year 12 English Lit class, although I've wanted to read this for ages, and we discussed Nick as a narrator in depth. While I agree with what my teacher and classmates said, Nick is extremely naïve and doesn't have much of an opinion on anything, I very much disagree with the idea that this is because he's easily lead. I made my case several times in the lesson and none of my peers really seemed to buy into it, but my reason is this; throughout the course of this book, Nick is making connections. That's why he went to West Egg in the first place, if I'm not mistaken, to reconnect with his distant cousin Daisy (and perhaps take advantage of all of Tom's old money connections). This is why I thought he was so reluctant to interfere with Tom's abuse of Daisy with the blatant relationship with his mistress. This is also the reason that I think Nick, as a narrator, so rarely forms opinions on people - good or bad. Another reason for this is, of course, the fact that he seems to be relaying Gatsby's story. He's very much the narrator of somebody else's life - this is not Nick's story, it is Gatsby's. I'm slightly annoyed that I knew exactly what was going to happen before reading the book - everybody does. I feel like had I not known, the intense build up of pent up feelings and things that needed to be said that Fitzgerald creates would have been far more effective in creating a sense of intrigue and mystery, as this novel obvious was meant to do. I very much enjoyed this novel, and am glad it lived up to my high expectations, as I HAD been wanting to read it for a very long time before I got around to doing it. "
1238,Kate Hiner," I will start out by saying that I really enjoyed reading this book. Fitzgerald paints a gloomy yet glamorous picture of the “roaring twenties”. In this story the narrator Nick Caraway recounts the time that he spent in New York, and like everyone he was drawn there by the glitz and the potential to make it big. As he discovers all that glitters is gold. He meets the aloof and interesting Gatsby who nobody really seems to know anything true about. He soon discovers that Gatsby used to know his cousin Daisy who is now married with a young child. This book is about how deep the prejudices of classism ran in those days and how even with money you could still not be accepted. In the end I was disgusted with Daisy and how she treated Gatsby with distain and indifference, even after he took the blame for her crime and suffered public scorn and was shot in cold blood. I really loved this book. The story isn’t a typical love story and you see one mans fight for the love of his life and how she rejects him and he loves her till the end still having hope that she loves him too. "
1239,Saji Connor,"""Il Grande Gatsby"".Lo dico. Le emozioni che questo libro mi ha dato sono strabilianti, così come lo è la storia. Lo posso inserire mentalmente tra i classici. E non mi vergogno a dirlo.Lo trovo un vero capolavoro.Allora. Detto ciò, non vorrei che fosse trapelato il mio parere su questo libro...Da queste 162 pagine di romanzo FS Fitzgerald fa narrare a Nick Carraway tutta la vicenda in prima persona raccontando di sé e delle persone che più lo hanno colpito. Lui è alla soglia dei suoi primi trent'anni ed è un giovane che dopo aver tanto studiato, cerca di sbarcare il lunario con la compra-vendita di azioni nella New York degli anni Venti. L'Età del Jazz.Nel quartiere dove va ad abitare conosce il ricco Jay Gatsby che ha la sua stessa età ed è suo vicino di casa, ha un passato ombroso e gli invitati alle sue strabilianti feste raccontano le versioni più fantasiose riguardo la sua vita, ma quale sarà quella vera?Nick ha degli amici, quì incontra di nuovo Daisy e suo marito Tom che gli fanno conoscere Jordan Baker una nota giocatrice di golf.Questi personaggi avranno tutti lo stesso destino di incontrare o incontrare di nuovo Jay Gatsby il quale sembra essere sempre capace di sconvolgere la vita di chi lo incontra.Intesa la narrazione, le vicende e gli eventi. Drammatico è il romanticismo e l'inseguimento di un sogno che si fa più grande della realtà.Mentre si narra il presente viene magistralemente inserito in pensieri e dialoghi col narratore brevi stralci della vita passata dei vari personaggi, da poter così avere un quadro completo della storia.In questo libro c'è una precisa fotografia anche di ciò che sono stati gli anni Venti a New York e quindi anche l'epoca in cui ha vissuto l'autore stesso del libro.Opportunismo, potere del denaro, indifferenza... solitudine. Sono gli elementi che contraddistinguono questo racconto. Sono i sentimenti che albergano nella maggior parte dei personaggi, sono i sentimenti che sgorgano nel lettore che attraversa questa storia, e sono tutti sentimenti che rendono i cuori aridi o che provocano dolore fortissimo a chi li subisce.Queste le frasi del libro che mi sono rimaste maggiormente nel cuore:""Ciascuno si sospetta dotato di almeno una delle virtù cardinali, ed ecco la mia: sono una delle poche persone oneste che io abbia mai conosciute.""""Non c'è fuoco né gelo tale da sfidare ciò che un uomo può accumulare nel proprio cuore.""""Così continuiamo a remare, barche contro corrente, risospinti senza posa nel passato.""Da questo romanzo è appena uscito il terzo riadattamento cinematografico, che questa volta vede nei panni di Jay Gatsby l'attore Leonardo Di Caprio e di Nick Carraway l'attore Tobey McGuire.*______________________*""The Great Gatsby"".I say it. Emotions this book gave me are amazing, as well as the the story. I can mentally place it among the Classics. I'm not ashamed to say it.I find it a masterpiece.Then. Said that, I wouldn't let know my opinion on this book...Throgh thse 162 pages FS Fitagerald let Nick Carraway tell the whole story talking about himself, and about the people he remember the most. He is near his first thirty years and is a young man that after having studied a lot, tries to survive working in the world of Finance in the New York of the 20's. The Age of Jazz.In the district where he goes to live he met Jay Gatstby that have more or less his same age and is his neighbour, he has a shadowy past and the guests of his parties talk about the most various versions about his life. But which one is the real one?Nick has some friends, here meets again Daisy and Tom that introduce him to Jordan Baker a famous golf player.All these characters will have all the same destiny: meet Jay Gatsby who seems to be always capable of throwing in confusion the lives of everyone he meet.The narration is intense, so are the events.Dramatic is the romanticism and the research of a dream that becomes bigger of the rality.While the present is narrated is masterfully inserted in thoughts and dialogus of the narrator short excerpts of the past life of the characters, so we can have a complete vision of the story.In this book there's also a precise photshot of what were the 20's in New York and of consequence the same age the author FS Fitzgerald itself lived.Opportunism, money power, indifference... solitude. These are the elements that distiguish this book. These are feelings that live in most of the characters in this story, these are the feelings that flowin the reader that walk thorugh this story, and these are all feelings that make hearts dry or that hurts who undergoes these.These are the phrases of the book that I would keep in my heart:""Everyone suspectshimself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.""""No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.""""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.""This novel has inspired a movie that has just released.First time Jay Gatsby was palyed by Alan Ladd, than by Robert Redford and now by Leonardo Di Caprio and Nick Carraway is played by Tobey McGuire.Very first version of the movie was in the ""silent film"" years, so I really don't know how it really was."
1240,Sanjukta,"I have always felt guilty if I have remained unacquainted with a 'classic' by my teenage years, a little tug and nagging feeling every time its name came up. So with The Great Gatsby, several years too late but at least another 'must-read' down and a little less guilty (Grapes of Wrath nudges me while I write this). Also, I was determined to read the book before I watched the movie, and I am glad I did, in one fast-paced sitting. The first thing that strikes is the exquisite, breathtaking prose--complex, verbose but so lucid and expressive! The simplicity of the tale and yet the enormous scope of it startling. Nick Carraway as the impressionable narrator who moves from distrust to firm belief, to question his own position as one of the Mid West elites albeit on the fringes, and one who gains an invaluable if painful insight into the American Dream, is fascinating. The brilliant brevity of it is like an icing on the cake.Now for the movie, will watch it soon while the books remains fresh. And yes, can imagine Leonardo di Caprio as the young Gatsby, the tanned good-looking mysterious millionaire."
1241,Zachary,"This book is perfect. It's like it's written in air in fine white ceramic and you expect it to fall apart and break any moment, and it never does."
1242,JS Found,"In America, we tell ourselves stories to live. We will make it. We will be successful. We can be anything and anyone we want to be, no matter the circumstances of our birth, what class we are born into. There is no class in America. There is no obstacle we can't overcome. We will get the girl. These are comforting myths, but they are myths just the same. They are illusions sincerely held and propagated, but they are also devious stories designed to cover up the real people and places of power, the high, ruthless, soul destroying capitalism that is this country's true God.F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby was published five years before the first great shock and upheaval brought about by that capitalism. Its strikingly apt symbol of a pair of huge glasses looking on an ash field wasn't meant to but of course symbolizes The Great Depression, when no one could see the obvious cracks in the system right in their faces. The novel's haunting power--what makes it relevant to this day--is its sparse, evocative, potent symbolism. Here is a novel that works best as a short story--has the emotional effects of one--that is written with precise meaning. The characters are expertly designed to symbolize a few things: The Buchanan's, the lazy and arrogant rich; Gatsby, the optimism of new money and a new longing that redeems him; Carroway, the trenchant observer to this tragedy, finding his subject worthy of saving because the latter does not worship the same Mammon everyone else in the novel does, but has a yearning for its antithesis-love.This is Jay Gatsby's tragedy. His love for Daisy Buchanan in laudable, but Fitzgerald lets you know right away that it is also based--like so much of the novel--on delusion, on false seeing. Daisy is a deeply unhappy woman. She is rather paralyzed with unhappiness. But she has no agency, not having the courage and intelligence to leave her station and her stupid, racist husband. Gatsby, from the first, from his youth, taught about the American ideal of reinvention and progress, does not see this. His outsize wealth--pointedly not from hard work but from criminal activity--is all for show, to gain her heart. And he does. For a bit. Then events that have been working against him take a turn and he loses her and even worse his memory from her mind. She doesn't even attend his funeral. It is only Nick who does so, leaving our narrator embittered and reflecting on the so-called American Dream. In the novel's justly famous last passage and line, Nick finally gets America. It was a New World of boundless and promising nature and hope, and then, very shortly thereafter, it wasn't--it was paved over by the capitalist gods and every American's deep yearning is to go back to that halcyon period when the world was vibrant, before money ruined it all. But we cannot because we are too meshed in current high life capitalistic society, and we will ignore the Great Depression and Great Recession that come time and again, and we will ignore the glasses over an ash field and lock up our eyes to the empathy and fellow feeling in each other, in the building up of communities, because in America, you are a rugged individualist and the world is Darwinian. And so it goes. "
1243,sofia requena,"Es un libro tan elegante.El lenguaje que emplea nuestro escritor es sofisticado y delicado, sin llegar a lo extravagante. Tiene su calidad. Es único en el sentido.El Gran Gatsby es un clásico que siempre quise leer y que sin duda no me ha dejado decepcionada.Nuestro narrador es un joven que nos cuenta su historia, pero más que nada, su entrañable amistad con Gatsby, un hombre rico que estudio en Oxford.Los personajes sin duda tienen lo suyo, forman parte de este exótico mundo encajando a la perfección. Cada personaje es de un mundo diferente, pero sin darse cuenta, todos están relacionados entre sí. La relación entre nuestro afamado adinerado con la joven hermosa, sin duda es apasionante. Cinco años sin verse, pero por dentro todavía tenían sentimientos uno por el otro. Dando al rencuentro una esencia de calidad y nerviosismo. ""Sólo existen los perseguidos, los perseguidores, los ocupados y los ociosos."" Acepto que en la parte de la pelea, tuvo un cierto sentimiento de odio hacía todos los personajes que se encontraban en la escena y no entiendo porque, porque sin duda fue una de las partes más importantes del libro.Y nos damos cuenta, que cuando una persona se encuentra en problemas, pero esta en el mundo del dinero y del glamour. Se hundo en sus billetes y olvida lo que le rodea.Por otra parte, lo que me ha fascinado es la amistad entre nuestro narrador y Gatsby. Nos damos cuenta, que Gatsby pudo haber estado rodeado de mucha gente, pero a la vez se encontraba solo. Sólo hubo una persona que nunca lo abandono.""Aprendemos a demostrar nuestra amistad a la gente durante su vida y no después de muertos. Una vez muerto, mi norma es dejar las cosas en paz."" "
1244, Sophia B,"4.5. Fitzgerald mesmerized me with his beautiful prose and stunning atmosphere... A little incredulous at times but still entertaining, mysterious and fun! "
1245,Panther Smith,"I am pleased with myself for selecting Gatsby as the first novel that I have read in its entirety since I finished my English degree. I hadn't picked it up since I was 15, and I regarded it with the haughty disdain of someone who thought they already knew everything about their life, their plans, and their eventual outcome. I had no appreciation for the concealment and the truths in slant, the commentary on American cultures of different regions, love and loss, decadence and consequence.I was rapt with attention as Carraway unreliably wove a tale of desperate sophistication, replete with resplendent descriptions of the lavish lifestyles that Gatsby and the Buchanans had made for themselves, through some way or another. My favorite part of the entire novel was when Nick comes to the realization that Gatsby is but a facade for the human weakness of love, a weakness that will make people stop at nothing to get what they want.This terribly written review is brought to you by a rusty at writing, stuffy 18th century Brit lit scholar who just really enthusiastically loved my rereading of this book. "
1246,Wady,"I haven't remembered this book for several years... Up till I saw the movie. Then, I remembered why I didn't recall it in the first place - too painful!The love story - AMAZING! Everything felt so real, the characters were so subtle I could see my neighbor in there and the man passing by on my way to work. The eternal do-it-all-for-the-girl-you-love kind of fairy tale wrapped me into a film I never wanted to come back from. Oh, but the betrayal, the cowardliness, the nothingness; going for the easy choice, settling and sacrificing what could possibly be the only thing in your life that's gonna make you a better person... For me, that was a little too much. And having that kind of faith until the last moment. There is no love without faith. As there is no faith without love. The bitter ending. Made me not believe in real love. So, I chose to forget the book. Half justice was made by recognizing Gatsby's better colors, but still... He was viced, as well. Just not entirely. The main thing I've learnt - YOU ARE NOT VICED UNTIL YOUR LOVE-ABILITY IS! "
1247,Paul Balogh,"Gorgeous illustrations, clever extra texts, fabulous novel. This is how ebooks should be: better to read when compared to their paper sisters."
1248,Tiffany,"""He sees things that other people don't and goddamn is it beautiful.""Summarizes the book in one sentence, or at least the prose. Fitzgerald's style is perfection. He writes with that wonderful technique - stringing together incongruous words and concepts into shining little gems. Consequently the novel is peppered with very strange, very unique turns of phrase and description and metaphor, and his observations are enlightening and entertaining to read.Many authors rely on overused cliches and bland prose - but accusing Fitzgerald's prose of being mundane would be blatant lies, for it is unique, and it is beautiful. As for the book... I cannot praise it enough. I can't recommend it enough, either. The Great Gatsby is such a tiny novel, but wow. It's not a love story, it is a look into the innate corruption and materialism of humanity. The dialogue is especially representative of this; hollow and essentially foolish. The characters were so vivid that I felt as if I could touch them - living, breathing - the author's unique prose renders them into unique individuals. So the characterization itself is skilfully done. For example, Gatsby is a man who has everything, a man seemingly impenetrable. But he is solely defined by his love for Daisy, and as the book progresses that perfect facade decays, and - he is almost pathetic. However, Daisy herself is made so alluring by her murmurs; her light fluttering mannerisms which lend to her an air of transience...There is enough philosophical analysis out there already (wealth vs. love, the Great American Dream), but personally I feel that Fitzgerald has managed to convey his intentions well, especially with that running symbol of the green light and the water - All those dreams that seem tangible but keep falling further and further away - How we are all trapped by the currents of the past but seek to grasp the future - in hopes that somehow things will get better, and that there will be absolution. Maybe Gatsby was just unlucky. "

1250,Butterfly Mentions,"English edition""The Great Gatsby"" and what made him great :) <3: The second title of my review ;)My thoughts: When I first read the book, it was before I knew the film with DiCaprio (though the film is really wow :D) and before I heard a lot about the book. I loved the idea of the book of course and who can't love this cover?! I also love reading about the Roaring Twenties or Jazz age. I love Jazz because of its energy, it is lively, bold and simply cool. And I asked myself if this also would be represented in the book or in Gatsby himself. Oh, I nearly forgot: Long island <3 <3.The plot: The story is set in 1922. It is summer and a Jale graduate in his late twenties called Nick Carraway decides to stay in West egg, a village in Long island. He rents a small house next to Gatsbys (but to this time, he doesn't know Gatsby). The relatively young man is also a veteran (he served in the First World War) and he works as a bond salesman there. The Gatsby villa is extravagant as extravagant as his owner Gatsby is. There is always a party in full swing, but Gastby never participates. He is the man behind the curtain, the man with the villa everyone feels invited in, but nobody really knows well.It is a story about a broken dream, a broken hope and someone he wished to love, but never get.Jay Gatsby can buy himself everything as a millonaire, only no comfort or love. The story goes forth: Nick is invited to dinner to his cousin Daisy Fay Buchanan who lives with her husband Tom in East Egg. Tom and Nick know each other from college days.Here Nick also gets to know the young Jordan Baker. A golfer who is certainly attractive, but also cynical. They began a relationship in shortly afterwards. Nick also gets to hear the news that Tom cheats on Daisy. The young Jordan Baker tells him in secret. He also gets invited to Tom's and Myrtle's secret lair, an apartement in New York, they keep for their affairs. Myrtle normally lives in the industrial neighborhood, the region you don't want to know about or want to visit when you have a reputation to save. The area between West Egg and New York City which is why a secret apartment in New York is ideally for the two cheaters.Unfortunately for Myrtle though on the day Tom is visiting the two of them, Myrtle pulls his leg too often by saying Daisys name several times so he breaks her nose.It is a deceitful time, full of secrets and dark agreements.Once a time, Nick receives an invitation by the promising, presentable man with the great parties which amuse so many. And he also gets to know the man Gatsby, a distanced, younger man he knows from the World War 1 because Nick and him were in the same division. Nick also meets his lover Jordan here who reveils him that Gatsby and Daisy had a romantic past in which Gatsby adored her and therefore wanted to make money to be a respectable man who can win her heart in the end.He also chosed the house because he can see across the bay from his mansion the green lights of her dock from there.Gatsby hopes that Daisy will love him and he wants to impress her with all the parties, the money, the extravagance. But unfortunately the times he lives in and the rival he has, want something different in the end.How does the story end? What has the liaison of Daisy's husband to do with this?What happens with Daisy and Gatsby?And why is there a yellow car connected with a crime? Learn more about it by reading the book!It is exciting, it has a crime, a love story, two false amours, decadence, hypocrisy, deception and murder in it!!What a great, frighteningly, big-time tension! Kind regards, yours truly Butterfly German edition ""The Great Gatsby"" und was ihn großartig machte :) <3: Der zweite Titel meines Reviews;)Meine Gedanken: Als ich zuerst das Buch lieste, war es bevor ich den Film mit DiCaprio kannte (obwohl der Film echt wow war :D) und bevor ich viel über das Buch gelesen hatte. Ich Iiebte die Idee des Buches natürlich und wer kann nicht das Cover lieben?! Ich liebe es auch über die Goldenen Zwanziger oder die Jazz Zeit zu lesen. Ich liebe Jazz, wegen seiner Energie, es ist lebhaft, frech und einfach cool. Und ich habe mich gefragt, ob das auch im Buch oder in Gatsby repräsentiert werden würde. Oh, ich vergaß beinahe: Long island <3 <3. Der Plot: Die Geschichte spielt in 1922. Es ist Sommer und ein Jale Abgänger in seinen späten Zwanzigern, genannt Nick Carraway entscheidet sich in West egg, einem Dorf in Long Island zu bleiben. Er mietet ein kleines Haus neben Gatsbys (aber zu dieser Zeit kennt er Gatsby nicht). Der relativ junge Man ist auch ein Veteran (er hat im Ersten Weltkrieg gedient) und er verkauft Unternehmensanleihen von dort. Die Gatsby Villa ist extravagant, so extravagant wie der Besitzer Gatsby selber. Es ist immer eine Party im vollen Gang, aber Gastby nimmt niemals teil. Er ist der Mann hinter dem Vorhang, der Mann mit der Villa, in der alle sich eingeladen fühlen, aber denn keiner kennt. Es ist eine Geschichte über einen gebrochenen Traum, gebrochener Hoffnung und über jemanden, den er wünscht zu lieben, aber niemals bekommt. Jay Gatsby kann sich alles kaufen als Millionär, nur keinen Trost oder Liebe. Die Geschichte geht weiter: Nick ist eingeladen zum Abendessen bei seiner Cousine Daisy Fay Buchanan, die mit ihrem Mann Tom in East Egg lebt. Tom und Nick kennen sich von College Tagen.Hier lernt Nick auch die junge Jordan Baker kennen. Eine Golferin, die eindeutig attraktiv, aber auch zynisch ist. Sie beginnen eine Beziehung in Kürze danach.Nick hört auch die Nachricht, dass Tom Daisy betrügt. Die junge Jordan Baker erzählt es ihm als Geheimnis. Er wird auch in Toms und Myrtles geheimen Unterschlupf eingeladen, ein Apartement in New York, das sie für ihre Affären benutzen. Myrtle lebt normalerweise im Industriegebiet, einer Region, die du nicht kennen willst odee besuchen möchtest, wenn du einen Ruf nicht verlieren willst. Ein Gebiet zwischen West Egg und New York City, weshalb ein geheimes Apartment in New York ideal ist für zwei Betrüger.Unglücklicherweise für Myrtle jedoch, als Tom sie besuchen kommt, zieht Myrtle ihn zu sehr auf, indem sie zu oft Daisys Namen, weshalb er ihre Nase bricht.Es ist eine hinterlistige Zeit, voller Geheimnisse und dunklen Absprachen.Eines Tages bekommt Nick eine Einladung vom vielversprechenden, präsentablen Mann mit den großartigen Parties, die so viele amüsieren. Und er lernt auch den Mann Gatsby kennen, einen distanzierten, jungen Mann, den er aus dem Ersten Weltkrieg kennt, weil Nick und er in der gleichen Division waren. Nick trifft auch seine Geliebte Jordan hier, die ihm enthüllt, dass Gatsby und Daisy eine romantische Vergangenheit hatten, in der Gatsby sie verehrte und daraufhin Geld machen wollte, um ein respektabler Mann zu sein, der ihr Herz gewinnen kann am Ende.Er suchte auch ein Haus aus, weil er von seiner Bucht des Herrenhauss die grünen Lichter ihres Hafenbeckens sehen kann.Gatsby hoffte, dass Daisy ihn lieben wird und er will ihr imponieren mit den Parties, dem Geld, der Extravaganz. Aber leider die Zeiten, in denen er lebt und den Rivalen er hat, wollen etwas anderes als Ende. Wie endet die Geschichte? Was hat has die Geliebte von Daisys Mann mit all dem zu tun?Was passiert mit Daisy und Gatsby?Und wie ist ein gelbes Auto mit dem Verbrechen verbunden?Lerne mehr darüber, indem du das Buch liest!Es ist spannend, es hat Verbrechen, eine Liebesgeschichte, zwei falsche Liebesaffären, Dekadenz, Scheinheiligkeit, Betrug und Mord in sich!!Was für eine großartige, erschreckende, mordsmäßige Spannung!

1251,Lachlan Smith,"I love reading books that were written in the 1920's/30's, because no matter what happens, the style is always optimistic and usually has a very subtle sense of humour about it - which is mostly true for the majority of ""The Great Gatsby"", which is about a war veteran who returns to New York to try and persuade Daisy Buchanan, whom he loves, to leave her husband and live with him. The book is set a few years after the First World War, and despite the fact that everyone is still reeling from that, the characters appear on the outside to be coping quite well.It appeared throughout the book as though the ending would be quite predictable, but this was a clever bit of writing on F. Scott Fitzgerald's part, because things quickly take an unexpected turn in the last fifteen pages or so, ultimately culminating in a very tragic and heartbreaking plot - for every character.Although Gatsby is a far more capable and appealing option than Daisy's husband, Daisy seems to be drawn by some kind of bizarre loyalty to her cheating husband - and when Tom (her husband) realises there is something going on between Gatsby and Daisy, instantly becomes incredibly jealous; despite his own wandering eyes.This was a terrific novel, quite similar to the style of P.G. Wodehouse, one of my favourite authors, and yet contains a completely unique style of its own."
1252,RoseClaryGrangerCelaenaTessa, Review to come............ 
1253,Joshua Rigsby,"Fitzgerald's genius is displayed in his artful description, true-to-life dialogue, and his pitch-perfect tone and theme. The decadence of the era, foreshadowing of atrocities to come (eugenics et. al), and Fitzgerald's sense of his story as a kind of morality play for the greater American experience give the work a larger significance than the sad tale of Gatsby alone. What's missing from this story? A savior. Even Nick's pitiful change of heart toward Gatsby at the very end only further accentuates the protagonist's ultimate isolation and the fickleness of wealth and prestige. The nihilistic final act leaves a bitter taste in your mouth, but I have no doubt that's what Fitzgerald wanted. The ending colors your view of the whole, the wealth, extravagance, and sadness of it all. I love Fitzgerald's descriptions throughout --""I could hear the taxi feeling it's way up the gravel drive toward the house""-- always perfect for the scene. Never overbearing. I love how his dialogue is constantly interrupting itself, allowing half spoken sentences to be completed I the reader's mind. I only wish someone had saved the day. But perhaps that would have spoiled the story and made it trite. It just makes me wince a little when nihilism wins and no one lives long enough to overcome their foils.http://joshuarigsby.com"
1254,Makenna,"Set in the 1920's this book will capture your attention and make you desire that you lived in a time other than your own. This book tells the mysterious, yet passionate tale of Jay Gatsby - a man who all know about, but few truly know. The book is told from the perspective of Nick Carraway, a man who is neighbors to Gatsby and ends up going on all the crazy adventures with him. The details given about the setting, the parties, the love affair between Gatsby and Daisy all capture the attention of the reader. Having read this book originally because it was assigned in school, I have since read the book multiple times, as it is one of my favorites. Truly meant for older readers, such as high school, this book will make people fall in love with reading. "

1256,Suzanne Moore,"Nick narrates this tale with an admiration for Gatsby, a sympathy for Daisy, a distaste for Tom, while frustrated by Jordan. He expounds on the “greatness” of Gatsby by describing with explicit detail extravagance of Gatsby's lifestyle and outlandish parties thrown to attract the Buchanan crowd. When considering Gatsby's lost love it is easy to feel sympathetic for him as well as Daisy. She was a material girl and may have deserved to live a lonely life with Tom … with objects instead of feelings. But I think as she begins to realize her feelings for Gatsby were on a deeper level, never mind his acquired wealth which definitely made him appealing. She begins to see a future where she might really matter to someone. Who wouldn't fall for the line “I wish I had done everything on earth with you.” I can see where Nick felt justified being the middleman for Gatsby and Daisy. Once he found out about Tom's mistress and saw how he used her, Nick couldn't expose the affair to Daisy without hurting her. I'm sure he thought that arranging for Gatsby's reunion with Daisy would make it much easier for her when the truth came out. Gatsby was sincere about his love for Daisy... it was what motivated him to escalate socially over the five years they had been apart. He only wanted to win her back. The money and celebrity status he worked for was all to make her love him, and that is why I think he too deserves some sympathy. Tom is the most narcissistic character. The way he kept Myrtle and Daisy simultaneously seemed to boost his ego. Knowing Myrtle was married made it easier for him to keep her as a side dish … he didn't want Daisy to know about her of course, but he enjoyed flaunting his mistress's attention. Then there was Jordan, a confident, independent woman who didn't need a man to make her feel complete. Nick tried … but he couldn't keep up.Fitzgerald's character-driven story had me intrigued as I analyzed the needs of all and their interactions with each other. I love a story that inspires a character's interior dialogue in my head whether or not it the author actually writes it down. I stayed absorbed in Gatsby's world and grieved for the tragedy I knew would come. "

""When the butler brought back Wolfsheim's answer I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me against them all""""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter-- to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning-So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past""

I WANT THIS BOOK TO STAY WITH ME FOREVER. I need to read this a second time. And then a third.... ▶ THE ADDENDUM BELOW WAS ADDED THE FOLLOWING MORNING AFTER I READ THIS BOOKThis book is haunting me. I woke up literally thinking about it. I woke up unsatisfied about the state in which things were left. I love the imperfect world Fitzgerald painted. About life; About how demoralizing wealth can be; About how we blind ourselves wanting for the things that have passed, taking every step backwards to get to them. To get to the past. I love how he painted man's ugliness, showing us just how rotten people can be with their menacing thoughts, their mercurial hearts, and their perverse and willful intentions.▶ 
THE PERSON OF GATSBY

""Jay Gatsby who dreamed a dream with a passion and courage few possess-and the tragedy was that it was a wrong dream colliding with reality that was even more wrong- and deadly""
 Gatsby was beautiful in a lot of ways, but he wasn't impervious to the imperfection of the world he lived in. He lived determined, so confident in the shadow he was chasing, but he never really lived, and every night he surrounded himself with people, but he never really had anyone. Money CAN'T manipulate time Gatsby. Not in your fictitious world, and not even in my real one. This book isn't even about Romance. It's about what then? It's about so much I can't put into words. I honestly don't know how to review this, and I sincerely hope that I'm making some kind of sense because though the night has passed, and it's been hours since I read this, my mind remains muddled and ravaged.▶ 
THERE'S REALLY SUCH A THING AS MEMORABILITY AND IMPRINTING -
The relationship between Gatsby and Nick is really something I found immensely endearing and weirdly melancholic, at the same time. How Nick revered Gatsby, loved him and rejoiced in his existence- that was one of the best parts of this book for me. It's like there's always that one person, iridescent as they are, who makes you mindless with wonder about the inner workings of their mind and all the things that line up in configuration to make them who they are. A person who seems as if they were made just so they could meet and know you, leave an impression on you. They'd be in your life--whether for all time or just a passing moment--and you'd know they were there. In the end, you'll be grateful for the memory of having known them, loved them, doubted them, and even hated them at times. For Nick, That person was Gatsby .I love the imperfection of Gatsby's world. I'm still struggling with the concept of justice, and what it's place is in this book though.To Daisy,You're giving women everywhere a bad name. You deserve Tom as much as he deserves you. And I sincerely hope that you burn each other to the ground.I feel so much better "
1259,Jack White,"I really enjoyed this novel. I found that Fitzgerald's use of Nick Carraway as the narator was very interesting and made the novel very easy and entertaining to read. This era of our nation's history is also very unknown to me. I enjoyed learning about it throughh this novel. I think that this is a very good book to read in school. My takeaways-Money cannot buy you everything. -Once you are dead, you want people to remember you as a friend, not some rich guy.-Never be so fixated on the past that you leave conciousness in the present. "
1260,Vittorio Ducoli,"Il grande romanzo di un piccolo decadente (?)Jay Gatsby è a mio parere uno dei grandi personaggi tragici della letteratura americana, che merita, sia pur con qualche distinguo, un posto accanto al Capitano Achab, al Clyde Griffiths di Una tragedia americana e a Martin Eden.A questi ultimi due personaggi, in particolare, lo legano moltissime affinità: poveri, animati da un potente desiderio di riscatto sociale sublimano nell'amore per una donna il desiderio di essere pienamente accettati dalla società cui tentano di far parte. Tutti falliscono e soccombono al loro sogno. Certo ci sono anche molte differenze tra i personaggi citati, e ciascuno è protagonista di storie dai tratti originali, figlie del periodo in cui sono usciti dalla penna dei loro autori, ma un tratto li accomuna: essere assolutamente e inequivocabilmente figli della società statunitense, delle sue peculiarità e delle sue contraddizioni.Gatsby giunge poco dopo gli altri due, appartiene all'età in cui il mito liberista inveratosi nel capitalismo statunitense raggiunse il suo acme, prima del grande crollo del '29. Le armi che usa per la sua scalata sono quindi quelle della finanza e del contrabbando, simile in questo a tanti dei voraci uomini d'affari di quel periodo. Apparentemente ce l'ha fatta: è una sorta di faro della vita mondana di Long Island, le sue feste sono frequentate dagli esponenti di quello che in Europa si sarebbe chiamato demi-monde, attricette, arrampicatori sociali di ogni risma, semplici approfittatori. Sul suo passato e sul suo presente circolano, alimentate da lui stesso, svariate leggende. Gatsby però sa che tutto questo non avrà senso se non riuscirà a riconquistare Daisy, la ragazza che alcuni anni prima l'ha rifiutato – preferendogli il gretto razzista Tom Buchanan – perché appartenente ad una classe sociale inferiore. Daisy è l'equivalente più crudele e ipocrita della Ruth di Martin Eden e della Sondra di Una tragedia americana: rappresenta la donna borghese, pronta a sacrificare alla sua tranquillità sociale non solo il sentimento, ma anche la dignità: è infatti perfettamente consapevole dei tradimenti del marito, ma finge di non vederli per conservare il suo status. La storia finirà naturalmente male, e Gatsby, cattiva coscienza della sua epoca e della società che essa esprime, verrà di fatto eliminato, per interposta persona, proprio da Tom Buchanan, con la tacita complicità di Daisy.Fitzgerald ci regala due ultimi capitoli splendidi, nei quali affonda il coltello ancora di più nella piaga purulenta della ipocrisia e della mancanza di valori (escluso quello del denaro) della società americana del suo tempo, e nei quali emerge anche la figura del narratore, Nick Garrison, che tira la morale della vicenda di cui è stato coprotagonista. E' naturalmente una morale amara ma, come spesso capita negli scrittori statunitensi, monca: anche Garrison/Fitzgerald infatti sembra dirci che l'unica possibilità di redenzione da questo mondo crudele sta nel ritornare ai buoni vecchi valori di una volta, all'America rurale dove tutto era più vero. Nick, infatti, abbandona il suo lavoro in borsa e il rutilante Est per tornare nel Middle West da dove era venuto, un poco compiaciuto di essere cresciuto nella casa dei Carraway, in una città dove le dimore sono ancora da decadi chiamate col nome di famiglia. Ci dice che in fondo tutti i protagonisti della vicenda erano del West, e quindi forse inadatti a vivere nell'Est. Sembra che neppure Fitzgerald sfugga al grande limite culturale statunitense: pensare che non esista altro al mondo che gli Stati Uniti d'America, che i valori che questa terra esprima siano i soli da cui partire per la soluzione di ogni problema. Non lo sfiora neppure l'idea che forse il capitalismo dell'Est e il modo rurale del Middle West sono le due facce di una stessa medaglia, che l'uno non potrebbe esserci se non fosse stato preceduto dall'altro, e che forse è l'insieme dei valori che questa terra esprime che dovrebbe essere messo in discussione. Da questo punto di vista ritengo più crudi e disperati i romanzi di London e di Dreiser a cui ho accostato Il grande Gatsby, li ritengo più universali e meno americani.Fitzgerald scrive infatti Il grande Gatsby praticamente negli stessi anni in cui in Europa scrivevano Kafka, Musil, Proust, Broch, Svevo e molti altri. Mentre in questi autori (e in molti altri) al senso della catastrofe non si accompagnano certezze circa il “come uscirne” è comune a chi sta al di là dell'Oceano avere sempre una sponda interna cui attraccare. Avesse scritto in Europa, Fitzgerald sarebbe forse stato classificato come piccolo decadente.Per finire, voglio condividere la tristezza di leggere un romanzo di questo spessore nell'edizione “I miti” Mondadori, dove tutto, a partire dalla copertina, comunica la decadenza dell'editoria berlusconizzata: non c'è introduzione, postfazione o commento. Non c'è neppure un indice! Fortunatamente le esigenze di risparmio hanno portato a utilizzare la classica traduzione di Fernanda Pivano, che seppur da molti criticata a me è piaciuta parecchio."
1261,Bob Simon,"This is a book I first read in high school in Oregon. The people in East Egg and West Egg seemed as glamourous and remote from my world as those inhabitants of obscure island cultures studied by Margaret Mead. I read it again ten years later...after Columbia....and thought I understood it....and had met the later 20th Century versions of Fitzgerald's people at school and in the paratroops. The third time was ten years after that. On the fantail of the ferry from Stockholm to Turku. It had much more resonance. Married into a family that opened the doors of some parallel and overlapping societies, I began to examine....close up....the extraordinarily old wealthy...and those who aspired to it. Swore I would read it every ten years...and have.It is almost a new book every decade. Each rereading is more and more impressive. The simplicity. The craft. The understanding. It is one of America's greatest books...and one of the physically thinnest.One of the top three books I have ever read. The one I will re-read until I have no more sight. Or insight."
1262,Linda Edquist,"I think I remember reading this so long ago but listening it to it on audio now was such a different experience. I grew up on Long Island - my Grandparents were servants and builders for the crowd portrayed in the story so it really hit home this time. Reflected back on some of the pictures I uncovered of my Grandma Edquist, as the cook for JP Morgan on his Long Island estate, they look different now. "
1263,Xfi,"Esta es una de las novelas más influyentes de la literatura del siglo XX, aunque, paradójicamente, y tal como ha ocurrido en muchas otras ocasiones, fue ignorada y olvidad en la época de su publicación, solo tras la muerte del autor la obra se convirtió en el objeto de culto que es ahora. Pese a esto, Scott Fitzgerald no fue un escritor fracasado, las dos primeras novelas publicadas antes de ésta tuvieron éxito, al igual que sus trabajos posteriores, pero Scott, que tenía bastante de sus personajes, aspiraba a más, y no llegaba a ganar lo suficiente para mantener el nivel de vida que él y su mujer deseaban, vivía fundamentalmente de los relatos cortos publicados en revistas y de hacer guiones para Hollywood, actividad que le llevó a California donde encontró el renombre y el dinero que buscaba. Impactado por la enfermedad mental de su mujer y alcoholizado, murió prematuramente de un infarto con apenas 46 años, lo que contribuyó sin duda a su posterior proyección como escritor de culto. El Gran Gatsby se considera un retrato de la alta sociedad urbana estadounidense de los años 20 y una de las novelas que ejemplariza eso que se conoció como “La belle Epoque”, mujeres desenfadadas y libertinas, jóvenes que solo pensaban en las fiesta y cócteles, un modo de vida opulento que llegó a su fin con el crack del 29 y su contrarrevolución conservadora. Detrás de todo eso la novela de Fitzgerald retrata también el proceso de maduración que tuvieron muchos de esos jóvenes en la Primera Guerra Mundial, los conflictos internos de los personajes, el precio de la ambición y la obsesión por el amor no correspondido. Gran novela, excelente para entender una parte de la historia del siglo XX y que traslada mentalmente a una época idealizada pero llena de conflictos. "
1264,Jake Obalu,"This is one of my five favorite books. The Great Gatsby is the quintessential American novel. In it, Fitzgerald demonstrates the American Dream in its entirety; ambition, effort, and success against the odds. He shows wealth's beauty as well its corresponding greed, materialism, and arrogance through long, flowing, yet not overly florid sentences. Fitzgerald examines the crux of choosing between love and work, and explores a definition of what success really is, whether financial, emotional or both. Furthermore, he examines failure, and debates whether colossal setback dooms a character, or if he bounces back stronger. Throughout all this, Fitzgerald paints a complete picture of the roaring twenties- a time of innovation and progress as well as of exceptional greed and inequality. This novel is American as they come, and all American readers will finish with a greater comprehension of their country."
1265,David Posey,"In this great American novel, true love doesn't really conquer all..."
1266,Léon Margeux,"Honestly, Words cannot express just how much I loved this book.More than just a simple love story, The Great Gatsby also teaches several timeless lessons; namely that money cannot bring you happiness in this world, that and you cannot make decisions in life-either good or bad-without expecting some kind of consequence, and that in spite of your efforts, you cannot change the past.F. Scott's The Great Gatsby is an excellent book and one of the few I would happily reread. It is also a book that has stayed with me longer than any other book, and one that I would recommend to anyone willing to read it. Keep in mind though that it is no walk in the park. I did find myself on one or two occasions hating the main characters for being so ridiculously stupid and base, but all the more to add to the authenticity of the times.If you haven't read this book already and you are interested im reading it, by all means, GET THE BOOK. It is an amazing story, albeit a little depressing at the end, but amazing nonetheless!"
1267,David Galloway,"I must confess, I am a literature fan who has never read one of the hallmark American Lit novels. Somehow I missed The Great Gatsby (TGG) in high school and college, and didn't get around to it until now. I think I might start a series on exploring some of the classic high school reading list books I never read. Would anyone be interested in that?I listened to an audiobook version of the novel from my local library. It's a short book, less than 250 pages if I recall, and the narrated version took up a little less than four audio CDs. I started it on Monday evening and finished this morning on my drive to work.It feels a little presumptuous to delve into the plot itself, given how far behind the ball I was, but I highly enjoyed TGG. The language is beautiful, the plot is well-woven, and it was quite pleasant to be whisked away to 1920s NYC and surrounding towns at a time where everyone still talks about what they did during World War I, prohibition is still in effect but is mostly ignored, and the upper classes are enjoying the pinnacle of life with no signs of the coming stock market crash.I want to read a print copy of the book, probably in a year or two, so I can experience the flow of the prose again and get to inhabit the worlds of Jay Gatsby, Nick Carraway, Tom and Daisy Buchanan, Jordan Baker, and the rest of the colorful supporting cast.http://dgalloway.com/the-great-gatsby..."
1268,Amira,"The Great Gatsby von F. Scott Fitzgerald. Sowohl Buchtitel als auch Autor nagten schon längere Zeit an meiner Leseneugierde, sodass ich schließlich beherzt danach griff - voller Spannung, was sich nun tatsächlich hinter dem hoch gelobten Werk der klassischen amerikanischen Literatur verbergen würde. Der Roman fängt den Zeitgeist der Goldenen Zwanziger Jahre in Amerika treffend und unverfälscht ein und rankt sich um die mysteriöse Figur des Jay Gatsbys. Erzählt wird dabei jedoch nicht aus seiner, sondern aus Nick Carraways Sicht, ein junger Aktienmakler, der das Nachbarhaus bezieht.Die Person, das sich hinter dem Namen Gatsby verbirgt, bleibt fortwährend im Halbdunkel; einerseits ist seine Präsenz zwar zu jeder Zeit - in jeder Zeile - spürbar, andererseits erfahren wir von ihm nur durch Nicks (teils subjektiven, teils interpretativen) Erinnerungsfilter. Thematisiert wird das Streben nach Erfolg, Reichtum, Glück und Liebe (,die Schattenseite eben jener großer Ziele), die Erfüllung des amerikanischen Traumes und sein ebenso schnelles Zerplatzen. Neben der Handlung und Charakterzeichnung gilt meine Lob insbesondere dem Schreibstil: Er ist atmosphärisch, dicht und stilvoll. Voller bildhaft malerischer Beschreibungen - es ist ein Lesen mit allen Sinnen! - und von einer Ausdrucksstärke, die sich auch in scheinbar nebensächlichen Szenen wiederfindet (z.B. Szene mit Daisy, Gatsby und seinen Hemden, sowie die immer wieder einfließende Beschreibung von Daisys Stimme). Dabei scheint jedes vom Autor gewählte Wort bewusst gesetzt zu sein, keines ist überflüssig oder zu viel. ... Ich selbst habe mich ja immer wieder dabei ertappt, Absätze zum wiederholten Mal zu lesen, einfach weil sie mich derart in ihren Bann gezogen haben (z.B. Beschreibung der Buchanan Villa). Wie man sieht, ich bin voll des Lobes, daher ...Fazit: Grandios! Ein absolut empfehlenswertes Leseerlebnis! PS.: Das (wenn auch knapp bemessene) Nachwort von Paul Ingendaay ist ebenfalls lesenswert und bietet interessante Gedankengänge und Hintergrundinformationen (... auch wenn ich nicht weiß, in wie weit das in den verschiedenen Buchausgaben enthalten ist).

1269,Garrett Zecker,"The Great Gatsby is one of those books that really allows you to take a look at yourself and re-imagine what life would be like if you were to sell yourself to become the big thing. If you became the big thing, it allows you to try to imagine what you would have been if you weren't. If you aren't, it allows you to refocus. The weird thing about this book is that there are many men in the United States to whom this book is accurate and applicable, no matter what station they are currently in life. I think that there are also many women that fall into this category as well. We all want to become something, and we all have regrets from our past that follow us around and make for a particularly painful reminder of what we could have been if things had been simpler. But Gatsby is a tragic figure, for one, and the man who we meet everyone through is nonjudgmental. This sequence of events is simply unintelligible when faced with the overall burden of ""first world problems"" and the fact that no matter how bad things are going, things are really really really going terribly terribly terribly well. That is a simple fact. A fact that one is unable to ignore in this text unless you are as daft as the man who it is ironically named after is that in the United States, we are patsies to an insatiable hunger, unable to find true happiness until we are faced with the very peace that may ultimately kill us. Long live the mighty dollar. A great book that is simple, quick, and carries the heat, passion, and liquor of the end of the gilded age. A beautiful text that is masterfully written."
1270,Duffy Pratt,"It was assigned to us in 10th or 11th grade, and like all books that were assigned for school at the time, I didn't read it. I think I picked it up on my own in College, or maybe just after, and loved it at that time. Thirty years later it stands up just as well. It's an odd book in that pretty much all the characters are despicable. The only one I found myself liking this time was Wolfsheim, the Jewish gangster who used Gatsby as a front man.The rest are vapid, self-absorbed, a bit foolish, and self-absorbed. Nick stands apart because the writing is so beautiful that it's hard to believe that he's as foolish as he is. Tom also stands apart for being not only all of the above, but pretty loathsome as well. I'd also like to make a brief comparison to The Sun Also Rises. In that book, the characters have all the same failings as the people here. But for some reason I can't quite put my finger on, Hemingway made me like his detestable characters, whereas Fitzgerald makes me look at all of his with disdain. Maybe I'm wrong about this, and I might just pick up the Hemingway again to see if I am."
1271,Ghalia Almutairi ,*siiiiiiighs*

1274,Emily Usher,"It took some time for me to adapt to Fitzgerald's beautiful writing style. As I tend to be a plot-driven reader, I don't always process more poetic novels as quickly. That being said, once I had locked in, I became fully immersed in the world weaved by this master. I drank it in. I adored the portrait of luxury which was the surface of every scene, and the painful depth each character posessed. I would read it again and again. Fantastic."
1275,Efka,"Kadangi prieš skaitydamas jau buvau matęs filmą, tai knyga buvo tik malonus priedas. Kita vertus, maloniai nustebino faktas, kad filmas taip tiksliai pastatytas, tik su minimaliais pakeitimais. Patiko filmas, tad nenuostabu, kad knygą irgi vertinu puikiai. Ir kažkaip galvoju, kad būtent tokios knygos yra tas tikrasis, gerasis ""romance"" žanras, o ne visokie papigiaiski ""ledi kažkokios paslaptis"" ar ""Antaninos meilužis"" etc. P.s. - tai ar ne sterva ta Ramunė? :)"
1276,Bernard James,"A few days ago I finished reading the Great Gatsby and I can honestly say that it was one of the most interesting and well written books I have ever read. Unlike Catcher in the Rye, To Kill a Mockingbird and a few other classical favorites of note, Gatsby eluded my notice during my High School and Undergraduate years. Having ""discovered"" it so late, I can't help but wonder how my current literary perspective has shaped my interpretation of the book and whether I would have gleaned the same amount of insight and pleasure from the novel had I read it sooner. In my opinion, The Great Gatsby possesses magical qualities that make it appealing to readers of all ages; but as an older, more appreciative consumer of literature, this novel came to me at a unique time and place as it relates to how I view myself in relation to the world and the people I love. Had I read it sooner I certainly would have understood it, but the impact would not have been the same. Gatsby is ubiquitous - having been analyzed and picked apart to such a degree that I'm frankly uncomfortable with the idea of trying to frame this post in the context of a review; so instead, let me simply tell you how the book made me feel.I knew a real life Gatsby - who kept coming back to me as I was reading the novel - and just like the man in Fitzgerald's tale, my friend surrounded himself and everything he did in a cloak of luxury that attracted scores of sycophants, understudies and admirers. As his close friend, there's no doubt that I was often caught up in the whirlwind that accompanied his lavish style; but my affection for him was predicated on something that went much deeper and no matter how extravagant the circumstances that defined our interaction, when the last of the dust had settled, our friendship always played out on a much more basic level. I saw a side of him that others were never permitted to see; but I have also since learned that I was not privy to all. Like the larger than life inhabitant of West Egg, my Gatsby also met an untimely end and since he's been gone, I have often wondered just how well I really knew him...or more specifically, how is it that I did not recognize (or fully appreciate) the depth of his pain and its connection to the material trappings that were always close at hand? It's nice to have nice things, but nothing is more valuable than the confidence, companionship and support of a good friend. Fitzgerald's characters felt so real. Even as I write this, Gatsby, Nick, Jordan and the Buchanan's are seated in the room having conversations around me. This is something that usually only happens when I resurface from a Walter Mosley novel, but not only was the gentleman from St. Paul able to pull this off - he did so almost 90 years ago and the fact that his characters and the message they deliver still resonate so well is a testament not only to Fitzgerald's skill, but also to the still relevant and painful lesson that material accoutrements can only get us so far. Solid Rock...and not sinking sand. Our hopes, dreams and motivations must be predicated on something true and substantial if we expect them to survive the privations and vagaries of life so often strewn in our paths. bj"
1277,Kelly,I've learned more about writing from him than any other author.
1278,Lisa,bloody brilliant!
1279,Sophie,"I was very moved by Fitzgerald's metaphors and imagery. His use of language is very strong and very well thought out from beginning to end. The whole story is packed with symbolism and it's fun to see how things like his reoccurring driving imagery becomes key to the plot. The characters are so pretentious and you just know something terrible's going to happen to at least one of them, and they totally deserve it too. But it's also interesting watching them all collide and destroy each other's lives. It's not fun for them, but it's fun for us to see that there is a consequence to the actions of these wealthy party-goers. The only thing preventing me from giving this 5 stars is the fact that I found the death scenes so vague, I had to go back a couple times to make sure the character(s) was truly dead and how it happened. Under Nick Carraway's narration, the deaths were practically insinuated. The lead up was there and then he just breezes past the death to describe the aftermath and I just wanted him to slow down and explain the death itself more just for clarity's sake."
1280,Kennidy,"A young man named Nick Carraway moves to New York in the summer of 1922 to learn about the bond business.He moves into a small cottage next to the infamous and mysterious Jay Gastby. Gatsby and Nick soon become friends, but it soon is reviled that Gatsby had ulterior motives. Gatsby is in love with Daisy, Nick's beautiful, but married cousin, and wants Nicks help.What follows in the most memorable summer young Mr. Carraway will ever experience filled with alcohol, parties, and relationships.I, personally, enjoyed this book, despite the heavy wording. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a master of story telling. I love how his wording really connected and relayed Nick's point of view successfully for the readers. He uses philosophical wording that has and will last for many many years to come."
1281,Lise,"I need to go back and check whether I really did graduate from high school. The reason I am concerned is the number of amazing books that must have been assigned that I know I never even attempted. Instead of going down as I get around to them, it seems to be going up. I don't think I even read the Cliff Notes. This is a great book, beautifully written and hasn't dated. If you ever drive down Summit Avenue in St. Paul MN with a Minnesotan, they will point to a house and tell you ""F. Scott Fitzgerald lived there."" It's always a different house. I listed to the audio book. It was terrible. Does anyone actually check those things? Full of mispronunciations (her ""wane"" face instead of her wan face) Car-away (really? not Carraway?? While it wasn't read in a monotone, the reader (?) just read it, he didn't change his voice for any different characters. I love audio books but this one was a huge disappointment. No offense, F. Scott. "
1282,Maruk,"Concise, poetic prose that flows from page to page. Fitzgerald managed to paint a picture of admiration and love, while detailing all aspects quintessential of the time. He warns us against the martyrdom-esque eventuality of making certain life sacrifices. A tragic love story I found myself completely engrossed in."
1283,Phạm Thuận,"tôi ghét tất cả nhân vật trong The Great Gatsby, kể cả Nick Carraway. Tôi ghét anh vì tính cách không phán xét, điều mà khi đọc những trang sách đầu tiên đã thật thán phục. Bản thân việc không phán xét chính là phần quan trọng trong cái việc tránh xa mọi thứ, bao gồm cả những rắc rối. Việc phán xét tuy giúp anh có được sự tôn trọng từ Gatsby, nhưng đấy không phải là hành động của một người bạn chính nghĩa, như những gì tôi được đọc trong các cuốn sách khác hay từ những lời được giảng trên các phương tiện thông tin đại chúng. Bằng cách không phán xét, Nick, mà theo tôi, chính anh khiến cho mọi thứ của Gatsby, từ kế hoạch, cho đến cảm xúc, đều gặp phải những rắc rối. Đáng lẽ, chính Nick, phải là người ngăn chặn những hành động điên dại của mình, hoặc chí ít, phải nói ra những suy nghĩ mà anh đã ôm trong đầu. Anh đã không làm tròn trách nhiệm của người bạn, mà chính xác, anh là người duy nhất có thể thấu được tấm lòng của Gatsby, có được trọn lòng tin của Gatsby, nhưng lại để anh ra đi theo một cách ngớ ngẩn nhất.có phải giấc mơ Mỹ là bình đẳng về cơ hội, về cuộc sống xa hoa của giới quý tộc thượng lưu, về một thời đại jazz vĩ đại nhất? có phải chính Gatsby, là kẻ đại diện cho giấc mơ Mỹ? là kẻ tay trắng làm nên tất cả mọi thứ, bắt đầu từ những cơ hội. có phải ai cũng mơ về một giấc mơ được sống trong phú quý, được chẳng quan tâm đến tất cả mọi thứ trên đời? Có phải những Daisy, và Tom, chính là tầng lớp mà mọi người ở cả trong thời đại này, đều mơ ước? Nếu bắt buộc phải thích một ai đó trong truyện, sẽ không phải quý cô Baker, tôi sẽ chọn Tom. Vì sao? Bỏ qua cái ""tầng lớp"" của anh ta đi, tôi chọn anh vì anh sống trung thực, bỉ ổi, nhưng trung thực, ""và anh luôn luôn trở về nhà"". Và Daisy, chỉ là một kẻ đáng thương, đáng ghét, nhưng đáng thương. Daisy cuối cùng vẫn là một cô tiểu thư mà thôi, cô luôn chọn một nơi an toàn, một nơi cô có thể sống mà chẳng quan tâm gì khác ngoài những trò tiêu khiển. Sẽ là sai lầm nếu trách móc, bởi vì cô đã được chỉ dạy như thế, cô có quyền được chọn, nhưng cô đã làm đúng theo suốt gần ba chục năm rồi. Thói quen rất khó để thay đổi. Tôi có thể tưởng tượng ra bối cảnh sau này, Daisy ngày ngày vẫn tươi cười, nhưng chỉ là vẻ bên ngoài, và chỉ quan tâm đến rượu, rồi những thứ vớ vẩn khác, và Tom tiếp tục tìm cho mình một ả đào khác.

1284,Jay Kim,"People desire to be wealthy. They think if they are rich, they probably can do everything that they want. ‘The Great Gatsby’ shows that how unfortunate to be rich, and even though the person is rich, they can’t get really important thing for human, ‘love’. Nick is the storyteller of this book, and he is in the book as well, by being Gatsby’s neighbor. He came to this ‘West Egg’ in New York, where a lot of rich people include Gatsby. They got close each other, and Gatsby realize that Nick is friend of Daisy, who was Gatsby’s lover during war. Gatsby told Nick that he wants to meet Daisy, and Nick helped him to meet Daisy. They met at last, and could’ve live forever happily, if Daisy didn’t have husband, Tom. Tom realized that Daisy is flirting with this rich guy, and try to win against him. But in fact, Tom was flirting with other woman, too. And somehow Daisy crashed that woman by mistake, but Gatsby decided that he will take responsible for her, and became criminal. Tom assumed that it was Gatsby who killed his woman, and told the woman’s actual husband, Wilson, to kill him. Wilson found Gatsby who was lying on air tube in his swimming pool, with looking at sky, and Wilson shoot him, and shoots himself too. At first time, I thought the main character of this book is obviously Gatsby. Because the book’s title is said so, and Nick explained about Gatsby very deeply. But at the end, when Wilson killed Gatsby, I suddenly thought the main character of this book is probably Tom and Daisy. They didn’t really come out compare to Nick and Gatsby. But because of their agitated love, Gatsby, Mr. and Mrs. Wilson died. Gatsby was unknown but very rich man, but that rich man died because of a woman, and even married. From this, I could know that even if a person is really rich, they can’t get something, and one of it is love. After I read this book, I felt something empty in my mind. All the characters inside were living there own life. And suddenly this person, Nick came into where Gatsby lives, and it changed everything of Gatsby, Mr. and Mrs. Wilson, Daisy, Tom, and Nick himself’s life. Because a small event happened, many people died, and rest of characters lived their life, and they seems like nothing happened. No one really feel guilty or sadness because some people died during this events. And especially Gatsby, he was a rich man and was living wonderful life until he met this person, Nick. And he remembered about Daisy, and eventually died because of her. In the book, Gatsby was described like he was laying down on water bed in his mansion, and no one is around. When I read this part, I could felt he seems like doesn’t have purpose to live. And he was shot by Mr. Wilson just in one second, and died. What he did and he lived for was all gone by just one shot. His wealth, reputation and money are all gone just in one second. And that made me something empty in my mind.After all, I gave five stars for this book. I have been reading these books and have been writing review for three books so far. And this kind of book, a book that has story with climax and suffering, makes me feel exciting. And I felt like I was in this book while I was reading. I liked it."
1285,Punit Soni,"First of all, it was a very easy read. Simple, terse and yet fulfilling in its own way and yet sort of overrated in terms of its popularity and the amount of critical acclaim that it's got. I can see why it is required reading for high schools though. It is a simple enough read and yet captures the golden jazz age of America in all its decadence and is thus, almost a fictional treatise on that era's history. Gatsby is young, brash, rich, maybe slightly tainted yet lovable and in love. The story revolves around him and his muse, the much married Daisy. The narrator has a somewhat distant air to him as if he was not as much a part of the story as a spectator of some sordid drama, the melancholy of which touches him enough to step in and try to change the plot but not quite enough to be a part of it himself. In my opinion, the Great Gatsby is a minor classic with huge sections of mundaneness lit up by a few brilliant lines and an absolute masterpiece of a three paragraph section bang in the middle of the book. Its almost like everytime I would settle into the routine of breezing through a nondescript story, Fitzgerald would shock me into wakefullness with that one brilliant insight which we experience many times over but articulate not once. From ""Why try to accomplish great deeds when it is so much more fun actually talking about them with her"" to a three paragraph ode to his past love which ended in his wait for ""that young vibrant girl who would in one brief encounter blot out five years of devotion"" to the final ""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . "", the book is replete with one lined masterpieces unabashedly placed in the larger workmanlike story. Finally, Gatsby is in all of us, living out our small greek tragedies, running towards our special green lights and sometimes extinguishing it."
1286,Christi,"I read The Great Gatsby many years ago, and thanks to an April book club selection, I dusted off my high school copy and re-read this classic tale. Wow! What an amazing piece of literature.The story is set in Long Island in the midst of the roaring 1920's, a time full of economic prosperity. As seen through the eyes of Nick Carraway, F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote a story of greed, affairs, forgotten love, lies, deceit, friendships, and deaths.Throughout the book we are introduced to a web of characters – Jay Gatsby, Tom/Daisy Buchanan, Myrtle/George Wilson and other minor characters - who have been overcome with wealth, yet they live empty lives, proving to us that there is more to the American Dream than money and popularity.A short book (not even 200 pages), a simple book, yet F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote a masterpiece about the American Dream.Not a big of a fan of some of Fitzgerald's other books (I prefer Hemingway’s writing to that of Fitzgerald's) but this an exception.... The Great Gatsby is literary perfection."
1287,Alayna,"Reread this classic at least 16 years (!) since my first read. They don't write books like this any more. Beautiful descriptions, insights into the human condition, superbly crafted - just as good as I remember it."
1288,Craig Halloran,"Finished ReviewAWESOME! That probably isn't the best was to put it on the classic like this, but it was to me. Here is why ... I have never read a book that was so beautifully written. I was astounded by FSF talent. I think if you are a reader of this generation, it would hard for you to understand what makes this book great. I know I would have thought it was horrible 15 years ago, or if I was in high school. However, if you were an adult back in the day, 1920's, this book would blow you away. The characters are doing many uncharactistic things that the people of that people didn't do. In today ever growing decadent society we read something like this and don't think it's a big deal. Shame on some of us, including me, because even I don't discern things the way that I should. There are other things that make this book great, but in all truth his flawless writer is what took me away. The characters are developed by what they do and don't do. It's a writers 'Show and Tell' thing, and FSF is masterful at this.I ordered this book before, but I accidentally got the penquin classic study version. I thought, ""how stupid am I"", but after reading this, and some of that book about it I learned many things I didn't miss. I am going to finish Catcher and the Rye now that I started over 10 years ago and got bored. I have the read the Old Man and the Sea again too. At 43 I am finally beginning to grow up.Great Stuff, but not for all.Earlier ReviewI've been looking for deal on this for a long time. I finally found it new for $2.97 at Book A Million. I just started reading. There are lots of classics for cheap on the shelves if you look hard enough. I am glad I found it.I am just a few pages into it."
1289,Becca-Rawr,"""The Great Gatsby"" is one of those classics that a lot of people look over when choosing a book to read. It's a classic, but more often than not people neglect the classics. This is not a book to ignore, I very much so enjoyed it!"
1290,Candice,Probably my favorite book of all time. I like reading it over again through out the years because I feel like I understand and appreciate it more and more as I get older. Fitzgerald is a genius and makes you feel sorry and envious of Gatsby at the same time. This is my favorite piece of American literature and I think everyone should read it at least once.
1291,Sean,"My favorite classic novel of all time. I've read and re-read and studied this book dozens of times. Why does anybody speculate about 'The Great American Novel?' It's already been written! 'Gatsby' was a major influence on my own second novel 'The Finished Man', which was in many ways intended as a tribute to Fitzgerald's genius."
1292,Laurie,"Coming from a teenage girl who doesn't read a lot of classics, this was wonderful. I got interested in it because of the new movie, which I havn't seen.I so enjoyed the glamour of it all, and how it is described - the language is DELICIOUS. It was one of the best things. I love how he described, for example, the parties, dresses, Daisy's voice, the hotels and Christmas-time. (He said a building was like a wedding cake. Delicious was a literal adjective here.)The characters are spectacularly written too. It was interesting to learn more about them.The story was never boring, full of drama.My negative point is probably that there were some paragraphs that were so descriptive and philosophical and deep that I had to read them twice. Hm. That probably makes me sound stupid. Oh well.I would recommended this to anyone aged 14+. Anyone, because I think anyone could enjoy it. It's a powerful story, and there is a character in there for everyone to relate to. It's a short book too, 144 pages, so it's worth your time!And hey, thought I'd share a secret with you! You can read it for free, un-illegally (i.e. legally. God I DO sound stupid.) because Scott F. Fitzgerald's copyright thing is up, because it's an old book. I listened to an audiobook on YouTube, and an ebook is available for free on The App Store/Google Play. Or if you'd like your own shiny, tangible, paper version it's like €2.50/£2/$3 on thebookdepository.comNo, I'm not a salesperson, why do you ask? I just thought I'd share the love of reading!...Okay It's time for me to go isn't it."
1293,Lottie,"So, I'm normally very stingy with my five star reviews but I just had to for Gatsby. The book isn't exceptional but my love for it is, which I think is what really matters with literature; the personal connection with the art. Also, I'm about to analyse the living hell out of it for English, so this will be my own review, before the smart notes. Fitzgerald is an artist, I love the way he writes, threading Carraway's narrative in the same honeysuckle way that Wilde does with Dorian. He's cleverly both invisible and invaluable to the story, having some sort of trustworthy softness to him that put Carraway in the middle of the story, without him ever really deserving such front row seats. In fact, the whole of Carraway's character seems based on the fact he has everything about him to prove, and he never does, even when he is in the centre of the Gatsby glamour, no one is sure how or why and his mystery is never explained. While Gatsby's mystery is almost transparent, he's elusive, but in an obvious way, unlike Carraway, Gatsby is upfront about his secrecy, it's part of who he is. Fitzgerald builds a world everyone wants a piece of: we want to be a guest at a Gatsby party, we want to find ourselves face to face with that charming and assuring smile, we want to be lazing in a mansion and whisk ourselves to a roaring twenties New York in a flurry of perfect luxury. Yet, we are constantly reminded of the emptiness of this lifestyle, we somehow believe we can make it worthwhile, we could do better than they did. For me, at least, Gatsby stole my heart from the first modest introduction and took it to his under-attended grave. The creation of something more intense than the millionaires lifestyle in Gatsby was, and remains, an impressive feat of Fitzgerald's milky Carraway, who slips in and out almost too easily. But like Nick, you just aren't the same after being exposed to The Great Gatsby."
1294,Ashley Ogbunugafor,"I just finished reading this book and I'm absolutely shocked at the outcome, but I can truthfully say that out of all the books I've ever read in my 17 years of living, this is the best literary work of art I have ever read. The use of literary devices and strong figurative language illuminates the book as a whole. Words can't explain how much I am in love with this book and I am at a lost for words. The book also brings many underlying topics to light; Love, obsession, wealth, status, and etc are all touched upon in this book. I don't think there are enough words in the English dictionary that are strong enough to describe how infatuated I am with this book. This is a MUST READ book. Those who haven't read it yet are truly missing out. "
1295,Lacy Lovelace,"I read the audio book:If you could sum up The Great Gatsby in three words, what would they be?Drama, glamour, & betrayalWhat did you like best about this story?I like how the story captures the essence of the roaring 20's with its huge, glamorous parties, fast-paced lifestyle, and drama-filled relationships.Which scene was your favorite?Oh, that is so hard because I enjoy all of the book! It is very well written. I would have to say the night that Nick Carroway attends Gatsby's party for the first time. I really enjoy the way the party is described as chaotic but in the same moment breath-taking.Was this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?Yes, the story has always fascinated me and before I saw the 2013 version of it, I wanted to have the opportunity to actually read the book so I have a better understanding of what is going on.Any additional comments?The movies do a great job of portraying the book down to the wording! The 2013 & 1974 versions are the best out of all that is out there."
1296,Eva Ashmore,"Why I decided to read this bookThis book (like most books I’ve read) was recommended to me by my brother who has good taste and I also knew there was a new version out (a film) so I saw both.What category is it in? and how did this make it interesting?This book falls under the category of ‘a book that has been turned into a film’ this made this review interesting because I got to compare the two and I enjoyed this immensely. I found that after watching the film I was disappointed as I think apart from Robert Redford almost everyone was miscast and I was shocked at how little fun they seemed to have with what I would have thought to be one of the most fantastic films to work on.The new film is loved by most who have seen it and with its all star cast and endless budget i expected to adore it but instead i found it boring, loud and childish. i found the acting cardboard the sets over the top(and not in a good way) and the effects sloppy to say the best.the whole film had one or two scenes where it was as if the director was finally taking risks and rather than just copying the original tried to make it there own and these where not just the best in the whole film but if the whole thing had that creativity then it would have lived up to expectations. My favorite quote from the book and films and why The films I noticed seemed to have an absolute bare minimum of actual script writing as it used nothing but quotes until 23 minutes in and continued like this with rear exceptions. But I think both I and the scriptwriter/s enjoyed the line ‘I hope shell be a fool- that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.’ This to me was one of the most tragic yet I’m sure at the time correct things I’ve ever read.Something I learned from this bookI think this book really showed me just how something’s are meant to become films and how much I expect from film makers. This may be simply because after about ten pages I was dying for someone to simply hand me the rights, experience and money to make the film myself but I really thought it could have been better.Both films had the opportunity of a life time but they both chickened out and just made a movie rather than a film.A character or setting that interested me and whyIt’s pretty boring but I was fascinated with Gatsby and his love for daisy and also his back story. I had very little desire to find out about Nick’s life and relationship but was interested mainly in Gatsby and Tom. I think this may have simply been because Nick was never meant to be the star or the one we all look at just the messenger.Both films seemed to agree with me and they cast their best actors as Gatsby and Nick was about as interesting as a letterbox.I am sorry if I offended any fans of the film but I was just disappointed and I am still waiting for someone to actually make the novel their own, which both directors could have done but they where to scared to change anything even though if you want it to be exactly like the book then read the book if you want a film then let it be different. "
1297,Abbie,"One of the most reputable love stories of the century, The Great Gatsby is a story of a man whose idea inspires an empire, whose dream creates a movement, whose undying love builds a universe in which no real human can exist. Jay Gatsby's obsessive love for Daisy Buchanan is like the American Dream, it is something so seemingly attainable, yet so unrealistic. The story line is enchanting, but what is even more enjoyable is the pure ingenuity of Fitzgerald's craft. Every word has a purpose, every line has a meaning. The complexity of each and every piece wove together with motifs and themes to make this book a work of art, unmatched by any other. "
1298,Benjamin,"I really enjoyed reading this again. There are some profound passages that shows Fitzgerald's ability to look within the American experience and find purity even within its many flaws and hypocrisies.What made Gatsby so great? Fitzgerald saw America as a landscape of possibility and wonder. Gatsby's story can be taken as a man driven by obsession with an authentic ability to live free and really experience a life full of wonder. The entire book is full of direct and colorful prose and it is no wonder that Hunter S. Thompson used to retype this novel word for word in order to feel what it's like to produce greatness. The wild parties were full of madness, color, and style which showed a since of America and the reckless beauty of the Roaring 20's.Fitzgerald believed that men had no second acts and the closing words of the book encapsulate the death of an obsessive dream to once again find simplicity, ""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.” Well said."
1299,Felix Purat,"Enough has been said about this book to write three PhD's, if not more. But it is impressive that whatever amount of celebrity is pinned on the name of F. Scott Fitzgerald, he matches that fame with a deserving quality of writing. Fitzgerald's ability at character development is also impressive (though the autobiographical nature of his writing might compensate for that). While Tender is the Night remains my favourite bit of Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby is indeed great and I would recommend it to anybody who (like me) somehow did not read it in middle or high school. "
1300,Neena," I have never read a book that reads like a beautiful poem. A new experience Fitzgerald’s writing was for me. Fitzgerald’s writing is charming in a way, it is sweet and sensual and deep like poetry. It gets engraved in your mind after you finish reading it. Fitzgerald amazed me with his keen, sharp insight of human nature. His writing is to the point, most simple yet truly deep, sensual and brilliant. He does not overwrite. I had to stop and reread many dialogues just to experience the sheer delight his writing gave me with its depth and beauty of the prose.I did not approve of Gatsby’s character first but now when this novella is still on my mind, I can see him as eternal child who loves unconditionally, blindly without any judgement. He is a dreamer, ever hopeful just like a child, unable/refuse to see the harsh cruelty. Sadly he loves Daisy who is shallow, bored and little hurt because of her husband’s philandering ways and is unworthy of Gatsby’s true love. Fitzgerald not only talked about 1920’s American dream, but also human nature in general. The world is same everywhere, the lust and greed for money, shallow relations based on abundance of money and power.Nick’s character is likeable. Unlike other characters he believes in moral values. Though he did not approve of Gatsby’s ways still he considered him worthy way more than others put together."
1301,Kayla Smith,"This is my favourite book. A lot of times I read something and the words, the quotes just stick inside my head. They unpack and they live in my brain. This is also a classic, so that in itself is enough for the book to stand on its own. It is F. Scott Fitzgerald's words that make this story. It is the way he writes that makes this something I read over and over again. It's such a truth of life, the way we hold onto our ideas of people, ghosts of who they were, like Gatsby does. ""No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart."" The whole book is a beautiful use of language. If you are losing faith in society and their ""likes"" and ""ums"", read this book. You'll feel a lot better about the English language. "
1302,Greta,"Me before reading it: ""Ok it's a super famous classic. America loves it. Hurray. So let's read it and check it off my list.""Little did I know how much I would love this book.The Great Gatsby is one of my favorite books now. To be honest I’ve seen the movie starring Leonardo Dicaprio first and even though I’m a fan of his acting I didn’t enjoy the movie at all. I still remember almost falling asleep in the cinema. So when I started reading this book I had the movie in mind. I was expecting a long detailed book about this sparkly guy named Gatsby and his tragic story.But it turned out that the book had a completely different effect on me. I was really surprised.I enjoyed reading it so much! It made me laugh and smile and also broke my heart and made me cry. The last few pages are one of the most beautiful endings I’ve read.For me it was one of those few classics I understood immediately. When I finished it I knew why it was so popular in American literature and why it’s being taught in schools. I didn’t need to lie in bed and think about it a lot and I didn’t even need to read lots of story and character analysis online to grasp the significance and beauty of Fitzgerald's story....(After watching the movie for a second time with the book in mind I have to admit that the adaption is pretty good. It’s hard to point out what exactly I don’t like about it but for me the overall atmosphere just works better in the book)"
1303,Lizzie,I would give this book 6 stars if I could.
1304,Tom Lichtenberg,"Quite a perfect story and beautifully told. Someone here at Goodreads gave it one star and complained that, as a poor teacher of poor children, she couldn't relate to this story, but what a shame she couldn't see how directly relevant it is to both her and her students. The whole American mythology of wealth at any cost is captured and immortalized here, along with the futility of every pursuit in the face of the lack of what matters most in life. Gatsby, having everything but what he wanted, is not so much tragic as pathetic, and within the book, only the narrator has perspective. The rest are trapped and doomed, prisoners of perfection, eaten alive by the very dream of it."
1305,javiruchi,"Absolutely a tour de force. Assigned to discuss this in class, I focused on the angle of alienation vis-a-vis the Jazz age and the concept of the American Dream. The novel's significant human experience is very universal that it echoes the sole ambition we all share: our (American) dreams and though they're 'foul dusted', each of us has this 'extraordinary gift for hope' just to make it and realize these dreams.Another classic to treasure."
1306,Bayo Omole,"Loved it, showing the American dream, and the illusion and corruption that was taken to attain it was fascinating. Fitzgerald shows us people with lifestyles that anyone would kill to have, yet in the end they are hollow, shallow, corrupt people."
1307,Katie Herring,"I've read it three times now.The first time I thought it was stupid, but I was in my younger and more vulnerable years and I didn't understand. The second time was just last January, and I fell in love. This time was in preparation for the movie, and I fell in love even more. I think I can say I have a favorite author now. Not for the plots, or the characters, because frankly, they could be better, but for the writing. I'll say I have a favorite writer instead. After reading his other novels, I was able to read Gatsby in a more analytical manner, and I was able to savor the lyrical prose. I knew what to look for because of reading his other novels. Every sentence, no, every word meant something. Every syllable had a purpose in the novel Gatsby. In the end, it is just a sad story. But it's not a love story. It's about money and wealth and the midwest. All of the novels are.I hadn't noticed all the things I noticed this reading go round. Next time, I'll probably notice even more. Naturally, I marked the whole book with lines and quotes I enjoyed. I do recall the one about Jordan becoming a new personal favorite, ""But there was Jordan beside me, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age."" And of course, how could I forget? ""She was incurably dishonest."" The saddest part(s) to me were when first, Gatsby and Nick are at lounging and Nick and some friends horse ride in out of no where. The woman asks him together, and as Gatsby gets his car, they leave. This reminds me of something middle school girls would to each other. Gatsby is just so pitiable. I guess you could say weak, but instead I will say hopeful and eager. Another scene was, of course, the funeral. Oh gosh. I wanted to cry so bad, but I couldn't. I don't think Fitzgerald wrote this to maker readers cry, but to think about the unattainable dream.You can't, and you shouldn't, repeat the past. Oh Gatsby, that poor son of a bitch.May 2013---Well I just read it again for a class project. I still love it and the writing was even better. I've seen the movies now (the famous three), and I will admit they pale in comparison. This novel is superb only because of its writing. It truly is a masterpiece. Every word is necessary, and that is how all novels should be.6 April 2015------I love this novel. I really do. I read it slow and savored every word-- something I don't always do. "
1308,Maddie O.,"One thing's sure and nothing's surerThe rich get richer and the poor get - children.- The Great Gatsby	The Great Gatsby is, like the quote reveals, much about the idea of wealth, as well as a romance novel. Jay Gatsby, the protagonist, has a secret past. His name was James Gatz and he lived on a small farm in North Dakota. Once he met Meyer Wolfsheim, he immediately became obsessed with wealth. So he worked hard (as an undercover drug dealer) and bought a mansion in the West Egg (known as the “new wealth” community). That mansion is known throughout the book as the party house, because Gatsby through many parties. When Nick Carraway, the narrator, moves next door to the “Gatsby Mansion” and is extremely interested. He stops by one of Gatsby’s famous Saturday night parties to meet his new neighbor and realizes that something is out of the ordinary. While talking to him, Nick can figure out that Mr. Gatsby has an uneasy past, probably because Jay mentioned that he didn’t know really anyone who was at his house that night. Because of this, Nick was intriguied by his character and ended up spending a lot of time with Jay Gatsby throughout the Summer of 1922. Nick gets what he wants but learning more about Jay’s past, which holds a place with Nick’s cousin, Daisy Buchanan. Before the war, Daisy and Jay met and fell in love. She was all he could have asked for, as well as most other men around Louisville. But, as all good things come to an end, Gatsby left for the war and Gatsby asked Daisy to promise him that she would find him after the war. Being the person she is, Daisy quickly found someone new. His name was Tom Buchanan and after only a little time, he “popped the question” and she said yes, despite the promise. Daisy and Tom (and their daughter Pammy) now live in the East Egg (known as the “old wealth” community), but Daisy constantly remembers her promise. Same goes for lonely and broken-hearted Jay. But once he puts two and two together, he asks Nick to organize a time for Gatsby and Daisy to reunite. At the reunion, all the memories of the past flows back into their mind and they both realize how much they truly loved each other. At first, it was almost silent, making it extremely embarrassing for Nick, Tom, and Jordan, Daisy’s best friend and Nick’s problematic girlfriend. With the re-budding of this relationship, the characters are faced with obstacles dealing with love, wealth, and wrong vs right. This is a story of romance, as well as just an incredible novel. While there is an ego behind this book, truth be told, it is a pretty average plot line in my opinion. But maybe that’s what allows the label “classic” to be attached to it: this story can relate to every one in someway. Whether it be the actual “love triangle” of it all, or giving off the moral that you can’t always get what you want. Not only did the morals, themes, and motifs stand out to me, the writing of Fitzgerald was absolutely unbelievable. Every single word flowed off of the page in a symphony of emotions. While the plot explanation was a little confusing for a 7th grader, it was still worth the read. As a writer myself, F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote a truly inspiring novel. Combining the plot, morals, and writing, The Great Gatsby is an absolutely extraordinary classic novel."

1310,TheGirlBytheSeaofCortez,"May contain very minor spoilers.I sometimes have discussions with my friends about which book epitomizes “the great American novel.” For most of my friends, the answer seems to be Huckleberry Finn or Moby Dick. For me, however, “the great American novel” is, by far and away, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s gorgeous book, The Great Gatsby. Although The Great Gatsby is set during the 1920s and America’s “Jazz Age,” for me, its title character, Jay Gatsby, is, and forever will be, “the” symbol of “the American dream” gone wrong.The Great Gatsby opens during the summer of 1922 in posh West Egg, Long Island. We “see” Gatsby through the eyes of the book’s narrator, Nick Carraway, Gatsby’s neighbor, a Midwesterner who has come to New York to study the bond trade. By using Nick Carraway as a narrator, Fitzgerald successfully distances us from Gatsby a bit and increases his air of mystery.Nick, the son of a wealthy family, is, above all else, fair and non-judgmental. Although Nick deplores the hypocrisy and shallowness of America’s upper class, he can’t help but admire Jay Gatsby, for Gatsby has charm and charisma in abundance. In fact, Nick finds Gatsby’s personality “gorgeous”:If personality is a unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.Nick Carraway first encounters Jay Gatsby as he’s (Nick) returning to West Egg from a dinner party given by his cousin, Daisy, and her husband, Tom Buchanan in the even-more-opulent East Egg. East Egg is the home of “old money,” of privilege and class, while the residents of West Egg are the nouveau riche. And this distinction is very important because The Great Gatsby is a book that encompasses class distinctions, social status, and elitism. Tom Buchanan, who attended Yale with Nick, has grown up with privilege. He’s domineering, hypocritical, and totally without scruples.Tom’s wife, Daisy (Nick’s cousin), seems, at first glance, to be the antithesis of her husband. Delicate and diminuative, Daisy almost always dresses in white, accenting both her transparency and her seeming purity. She’s not at all coarse (just the opposite, in fact), but she does affect a deliberate air of languor and jaded sophistication.Returning home from East Egg, Nick sees his good looking neighbor, Jay Gatsby, standing on his lawn, reaching out toward a green light, shining across the bay.From the novel’s opening pages, we know Jay Gatsby is, in many ways, a man of mystery. He’s enormously wealthy, but the source of his wealth is never made completely clear, though it’s not difficult to surmise that it’s something illegal.Gatsby also claims to come from “old money”, i.e., a prominent family in the Midwest. When pressed, however, Gatsby says he’s from San Francisco. Supposedly an Oxford graduate, he speaks with a very affected English accent. Although there’s much about Gatsby of which Nick disapproves, he still admires him and finds him irresistible.While Nick finds Jay Gatsby “gorgeous,” he can’t find anything at all to like about Tom Buchanan. Tom’s hypocrisy is shown to its fullest in his affair with Myrtle Wilson, a married woman who lives in “the valley of ashes,” a barren, dying area that lies between West Egg and New York:About half-way between West Egg and New York the motor-road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens, where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which screen their obscure operations from your sight.The decaying neighborhood is dominated by an equally decaying and grotesque billboard displaying a pair of gigantic eyes. These eyes belong to Dr. T.J. Eckleburg, an optometrist who used to have an office in the area. The eyes of Dr. Eckleburg seem to see and know all, much like the all-knowing eye of God:But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg. The eyes of T.J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face but, instead, form a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose.Myrtle Wilson’s husband, George, owns a garage in the valley of ashes. Despite the poverty in which she lives, Myrtle is, at least outwardly, far more alive than is Daisy. Voluptuous, sensuous, and vital, Myrtle much prefers flamboyant colors to the pure white usually worn by Daisy, and unlike Daisy, she doesn’t chose her words carefully or act with artifice and affectation. Neither woman, however, seems capable of deep emotions or selfless action. While Daisy lacks genuineness, Myrtle is vulgar. In many ways, this makes both women ideal companions for Tom Buchanan.Jay Gatsby is in the habit of hosting lavish parties every Saturday night, parties that showcase sumptuous food, unlimited supplies of alcohol, live musicians, and Gatsby’s legendary yellow Rolls Royce. They are, in short, a symbol of the decadence of the Jazz Age.Even during his parties, Gatsby remains a man of mystery. He doesn’t mingle with his guests and doesn’t even appear to know half of them. His parties are, however, legendary, with guests arriving from West Egg, from East Egg, and even from New York City:There was music from my neighbor’s house through the summer nights. In his blue gardens men and women came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or taking the hot sun on the sand of his beach while his two motor boats slit the foam. On weekends, his Rolls Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city, between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants including an extra gardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.While there is much about Jay Gatsby that is affected and artificial, we do learn that there is also much about him that is genuine. He is, above all, a man of contradictions.Gradually, Nick comes to learn more and more about Jay Gatsby. Most importantly, he learns that Gatsby bought his house in West Egg for the sole purpose of effecting a reunion with Daisy. Five years earlier, Daisy, who had been a Red Cross volunteer, had met and fallen passionately in love with Jay Gatsby, then an Army lieutenant. And, although she accepted Gatsby’s marriage proposal, Daisy didn’t wait for him as she’d promised; she married Tom Buchanan instead.At this point in the novel, Nick realizes that the green light toward which Gatsby yearns is the light on Tom’s and Daisy’s dock. It’s also the point where Nick becomes even more involved in Gatsby’s life when he agrees to arrange a meeting between Gatsby and Daisy.The reunion of Gatsby and Daisy, which takes place in Nick Carraway’s house, shows us clearly the fundamental flaws of character possessed by both Gatsby and Daisy, flaws that will, before the novel’s end, lead to several tragic events.Gatsby is a man who cannot seem to move forward in life. He wants to live in the past; he wants to recreate the past. If he could, he would freeze his first meeting with Daisy and live in that moment forever. He’s a dreamer; he’s a visionary; he’s a romantic of almost mystical proportions. While there can be no doubt that Gatsby does, indeed, love Daisy (he’s willing to sacrifice his life for her), he doesn’t love her in a healthy, realistic manner. Instead, Gatsby idealizes Daisy. She is, for him, the epitome of all his dreams: wealthy, sophisticated, privileged. Gatsby even idealizes himself. When Nick tells him, You can’t repeat the past, Gatsby responds by saying, Of course you can!The set piece in which Gatsby shows Daisy his English shirts is not only one of the most famous in all of literature, it’s also the one in which we see Daisy at her most “human,” her most unaffected, her most vulnerable:He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them one by one before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of Indian blue. Suddenly with a strained sound Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.“They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds. “It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—such beautiful shirts before.”Daisy, though, like Gatsby, is possessed of a fatal flaw that precludes genuine love.While Daisy does have genuine feelings of love for Gatsby, there is something she loves even more—status and privilege—things she can share with Tom Buchanan in East Egg, but things Jay Gatsby, no matter how wealthy he becomes, can never provide.After the reunion of Gatsby and Daisy, events in the novel quickly begin to spiral out of control and the lives of the characters become more and more entwined. The reunion seems to affect Gatsby most profoundly—he stops giving lavish parties, he fires his household staff, and, for the first time in his life, he begins to care about the gossip swirling around him. While Gatsby becomes more discreet, Daisy, however, seems intent on throwing caution to the winds, inviting the inevitable disaster.The novel’s climactic event takes place on the first day of autumn, in Gatsby’s swimming pool. It’s not simply for dramatic effect that Fitzgerald made these choices. The first day of autumn brings a chill to West Egg, but Gatsby, in characteristic defiance of the future, chooses to float in his pool, despite the cool weather. For him, the passage of time does not exist; he lives in eternal summer.The Great Gatsby is a beautiful novel, perfectly constructed and written in gorgeously shimmering prose. It’s filled with symbolism and even with religious overtones. Gatsby, himself, can be seen as a Christ figure, a lamb on the sacrificial altar of “status.” The book also presents a vivid, though quite unflattering, portrait of the decadence and sumptuousness excess of the Jazz Age.More than anything, The Great Gatsby, to me, represents the death of the American dream. Gatsby was a dreamer, a visionary, a romantic. He represented all that America, in her infancy, represented. The final line of The Great Gatsby is one of the most famous in all of literature:So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.Like the green light on the Buchanan’s dock, like Daisy, herself, life for Jay Gatsby was a dream, but always a dream just out of reach.5/5Recommended: Absolutely, with no reservations. This is a beautifully constructed, gorgeously written book, set against the backdrop of the Jazz Age, and telling the story of the death of the American dream.You can read my book reviews and tips for writers at www.literarycornercafe.blogspot.com"
1311,Kring16,"This was one of the better books that I have read for a class. This book is very interesting because of the way that Fitzgerald portrays his characters. The characters all have a dark side that the reader is kept in the dark about. You always wonder who is actually honest and who is faking it. The three takeaways from this book are as follows: money and materials alone cannot make someone happy, live as happy a life as you can because you never know when you will die, and true friends stay with you until the bitter end and beyond. "
1312,Del Herman,"Analyzing this book over and over and over again for AP Language has only made me appreciate Fitzgerald's novel more and more each time. This book is not only a timely tale of cultural excess in the 1920s but also a novel that is relevant to the times that we live in and to basic human themes, such as greed and lust. The plot is a simple one. Jay Gatsby is one of the richest men in West Egg (a fictional community reminiscent of the Hamptons) and pursues vigorously through his wealth the beautiful Daisy Buchanan, the wife of another very rich man named Tom Buchanan. The story is told through the perspective of Nick, a Midwesterner who moves to the New York areas and becomes involved in Gatsby's mission. Both Gatsby and Nick can both be considered main characters, both are some of the most interesting to watch develop throughout the novel. In fact it is Gatsby's plight that brings out the whole purpose of the book: the corruption of wealth and power on dreams. As Gatsby uses wealth and power to try to capture Daisy, Americans in the 1920s used wealth as a means of achieving the American dream, something that Fitzgerald considered highly amoral. Gatsby is the new rich of the 1920s, a man of zeal and passion, very wealthy, but fundamentally driven out of corrupt origins. Gatsby is Fitzgerald's exploration of the hollowness of the excess of the 1920s, but he is not a mere allegory, he is a strongly conceived and fascinating character who is rich in detail and complex in psychology. Every character and every symbol that Fitzgerald constructs is so rich in symbolism and meaning. An example of this would be Dr. Eckleberg, a billboard with two glaring blue eyes that can be interpreted as a) the eyes of God or judgment, b) the display of capitalism and consumerism, or c) a meaningless billboard assigned meaning by the characters. Such beautiful statements Fitzgerald makes through his imagery.Not only is the symbolism strong and the characterization rich, but the relevance and the impact is still there. Is not our culture today driven out of an insane quest for money, for material goods, for the hottest of new trends, for excessive parties and social gatherings? Is not the rich aristocracy of today not as wasteful and hollow-spirited as the rich aristocracy of the 1920s? Are not many young, rich, optimistic men driven by ridiculous ideas to pursue abstract desires? Sure, the culture is different, but the elements that fill the schema are much the same."
1313,Vivienne,"While the Phryne Fisher Mysteries are set during the Roaring Twenties and celebrates the glamour of the Jazz Age, The Great Gatsby is the real deal written at the height of the period by one of its leading lights and its vibrancy echoes down the years both as a portrait of an age and as a morality tale. It is also a study of class divisions and the shifts taking place in US society following the Great War. Despite the glamour the novel is without doubt a tragedy. There is a line near the end about the attitudes of the wealthy within the novel ""they smashed up things and creatures and the retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness …. and let other people clean up the mess they have made …."". Most of the characters are not at all nice people, they are shallow and self-serving. The saving grace is the narrator, Nick, who records the events yet could not prevent the outcome. I had read this novel in High School so many years ago and I cannot recall my response to Daisy but this time around I certainly found her vile. The prose is very lavish in its descriptions and I look forward to seeing Baz Luhrmann's 2013 film adaptation though wonder if it will have the gravitas of its source material. I was pleased that I did buy an edition with an academic Introduction as well as notes. However, I rather wish they'd been inserted as footnotes rather than my having to turn to the back few pages to read them. This was a reading group selection and while the response was mixed there were no 'thumbs down' and the group wavered between 'thumbs up' and 'thumbs sideways'. It generated plenty of discussion about its style and content. We also decided that later in the year we would read Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald by Therese Anne Fowler. "
1314,Bam,"Reread this for a book club selection and liked it much more the second time around as a more mature reader. After WWI, people seemed to be living life in a frenzy, knowing that tomorrow could so easily be taken away and what was the point of life anyway, except to do whatever you felt like doing? It is fascinating how self-centered these wealthy people were. They could destroy lives and never look back. And Gatsby's single-minded obsession with Daisy and that lifestyle was incredible. I believe this is my favorite Fitzgerald novel. I especially loved the image of the eyeglasses on the billboard as if all this was being observed. "
1315,Liat,"Wow. I've just finished ""The Great Gatsby"" and I truly believe it is one of the best books I've ever read. The language Fitzgerald uses is so enchanting and mesmerizing, you soon get lost in the world of the American Jazz Age and Gatsby's grand parties.A definite must for anyone who appreciates excellent writing and good story telling."
1316,Dmitry Yakovenko,"Удивительная книга. За свою малую продолжительность она успевает вызвать скуку, полностью искоренить интерес читателя, а после зажечь огонь в глазах этого самого читателя, не давая ему уснуть до того момента, как перевернется последняя страница книги. И ведь, черт возьми эту книгу, но даже после прочтения она не дает уснуть, заставляя возвращаться к ней еще, еще и еще, вспоминая великого Гэтсби, не желающего уходить из головы.Примерно первые страниц 40 книга стабильно держится в первой фазе, когда она лишь надоедает, ведь там абсолютно ничего не происходит. Читатель следит за скучными и неинтересным людьми с их скучными жизнями и скучными разговорами ни о чем. Пережить начало - вот главная цель каждого читателя, потому что потом, это произведение Фицджеральда захватит в его свои сети и не отпустит еще долгое время. Вот тогда все герои начинают открываться с новых сторон и перестают казаться глупыми пустышками. Вот тогда сюжет начнет вызывать искренние эмоции, делать резкие повоторы и нужно будет только сильнее держаться за нить повествования. Кроме того, появляется сам Гэтсби, герой, ради которого стоит прочитать эту книгу. Персонаж, который достоин целой книги. И он ее получил, хотя и не является главным ее героем. Главный герой тут, просто человек, которому посчастливилось жить рядом с домом Джея Гэтсби. И с их знакомства, начинают происходить удивительные события, которые приведут к действительно потрясающему финалу, который еще очень долго не получится забыть.Если что и мешает насладится этим проивзедением, так это довольно частые, нудные куски книги, в которых происходят какие то скучные и маловажные события, которым почему то уделяют много времени и немного нудное начало, когда ты, словно гость, в первый раз пришедший в чужой дом. Ты молча сидишь в неудобной позе, весь как на иголках и чувствуешь себя в крайней степени неуютно, но потом, когда ты привыкнешь, этот дом станет для тебе роднее своего собственного."
1317,George King,"By some quirk in my personal history, I'd never read Gatsby. It has many beautifully written, poetic passages, and Gatsby's demise retains an ineffable sadness that moved me in the final pages. The absence of mourners at his funeral was particularly poignant. Fitzgerald's theme of pursuing an incompletely realized dream is universal, with the corollary that if one's timing is off, the dream may forever remain out of reach. Add to this a crushing irony: in order to win Daisy, Gatsby strove to make himself a member of her wealthy Long Island society, but she is shallow and frivolous and her husband is brutish and racist. The others in their group show no loyalty to Gatsby, the man who'd thrown them lavish parties, by deserting him in death.I'll comment briefly on the poetic nature of Fitzgerald's prose. He uses two metaphors involving water that are linked inextricably to the action of the novel. At the beginning of the story, the narrator, Nick, notes that ""Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes..."" comparing conduct to an edifice that can be built on a solid base (""hard rock"") or a tenuous one (""wet marshes""). Foreshadowing is at work here as Gatsby's springboard into affluent society turns out to be a yacht in a dangerously shallow mooring. Unfortunately, Gatsby is floating in his pool at the end when he is shot to death. The novel concludes with another ""wet"" metaphor in the justly famous line ""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."" Humans are boats struggling to row into the future, while all the while carried backward by Time's river. Figures of speech are only effective if they complement the surrounding language and action.Another vivid display of language occurs at the beginning of Chapter III with a 2 1/2 page description of the preparations for and beginning of a typical Gatsby party. ""On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold."" Later, the narrator notes, ""The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names."" A milieu built on the ""wet marshes"" indeed."
1318,Sarah Shaber,"I'm a Fitzgerald fan, although he seems to have gone out of fashion."
1319,Rai,"Only ten years too late, I finally read this. And I was not disappointed. Fitzgerald's use of language and especially his visuals are stunning. His metaphors are as beautiful as they are unusual (a good metaphor is something I'm especially a fan of). The fact that he is able to tell such a powerful and yet simple story in such a small number of pages is even more amazing. His characters are flawed in such a way that makes you mad at yourself for still liking them (although some were more likable than others). You knew they could be good people and were disappointed that they fell short of their own potential. "
1320,Nathan Eilers,"Upon rereading this novel, I was blown away. I remembered liking this novel, but taking another trip through its pages caused me to appreciate it for the amazing work that it is.I think we throw the word ""masterpiece"" around too cheaply, and I include myself in that accusation. However, Gatsby is truly deserving of the term. Fitzgerald is the consummate writer in these pages. The characters are complex and well wrought. The plot is simple enough--two love triangles with an interloper thrown in--but it is moving and involving. The symbols and metaphors resonate. But more than all of these things, Fitzgerald is the master of prose in this short novel. He paints beautiful pictures and scenes, he brings dialog and description to life, and he evokes such affecting emotions. Here is but one example: ""For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened--then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk"" (28).This is truly one of the greatest works in English in the twentieth century. I hope everyone reads it at least once."
1321,Suni,"È forse il mio romanzo preferito. Anzi, fresca di rilettura tolgo il ""forse"".L'ho riletto, come mi ero ripromessa da tempo, nella traduzione di Tommaso Pincio per minimum fax, che ho molto apprezzato nonostante le sensibili differenze con quella della Pivano del '50, a cui sono affezionata.Non mi metto ad analizzare queste differenze, anche perché non ne sarei capace, ma di certo balza subito all'occhio l'uso del vecchia lenza per rendere l'old sport dell'originale, che invece la Pivano traduceva con vecchio mio: fa un po' strano, soprattutto perché come è noto Gatsby pronuncia queste due parole praticamente ogni volta che apre bocca (tranne quando parla a Daisy, ovviamente), ma a me pare un modo efficace per dare l'idea della ricercatezza eccentrica del protagonista, studiata e messa in pratica in ogni forma del suo agire al fine di cancellare il suo umile passato e la sua vera identità. James Gatz viene così seppellito sotto le nuove vesti di Jay Gatsby, questo gangser buono in abito rosa, come lo definisce Pincio nella postfazione (che consiglio di leggere soprattutto per un certo tocco personale e autobiografico del traduttore).Tornando al romanzo, è un capolavoro. La trama ha un meccanismo perfetto, nulla è in più, e i personaggi — a parte Gatsby e Nick tutte persone orribili — sono enormi.È una storia nerissima nonostante il luccichio delle feste, dei gioielli, delle costose auto cromate, e a me la triste parabola del protagonista spezza il cuore (il funerale senza quasi nessuno che lo pianga ancora più che la morte in sé).E il finale?Gatsby credeva nella luce verde, nel futuro orgiastico che anno dopo anno si allontana da noi. Allora ci sfuggì, ma non importa: domani correremo più veloce, distenderemo le braccia più lontano... e un bel mattino...Così seguitiamo a bordeggiare come barche controcorrente, sospinte di continuo nel passato.5 stelline per sempre."
1322,Becky Ginther,"Every time I re-read the Great Gatsby, I fall more and more in love with it. This is the American masterpiece. This book takes place in the Jazz Age, the age of the American Dream, the time when people thought they could have everything that they wanted. Gatsby is no exception – he has everything except what he really wants, which is Daisy, and he truly believes that he can get her. Unfortunately, the real world is not always as nice and as simple as dreams, and winning Daisy over is not as easy as he expected – nor is she the same Daisy that he knew five years ago. This book is just full of brilliance in every corner. Fitzgerald’s gifts truly lie in the characters and their emotions, and he feels what they feel so obviously that he can write it beautifully. There are so many great themes in this book- the idea of hope and the green light, the carelessness of certain people (Tom and Daisy), Gatsby’s obsession with the past, and of course the American Dream. How could you not relate to at least something in this novel? Fitzgerald’s writing is absolutely poetic at times, but his plot and his characters are always interesting and the book is almost never boring.There are only two books that I've really struggled to write a review for - Harry Potter, and this one. And that's because I love them both so much that I find it hard to really put my passion into words that I think will convey why they are so great. Because there are many things I could list that make it a great and enjoyable book, but at the end of the day there's just that special something that triggers in you emotionally and makes you connect to a story. And that's hard to describe sometimes.I love how real everything about this book feels. Who hasn't pined after someone with unrealistic hopes (though perhaps not as obsessively as Gatsby)? And who hasn't run into those careless people in life like Tom and Daisy? How many of us have experienced thinking you were being honest and then realizing you were lying to yourself, like Nick? And the symbolism of the green light - there's just something really moving about that.I could read this book 100 times and get something new out of it every time. "
1323,John Baker," The Great Gatsby is at once a romantic and cynical novel about the wealth and habits of a group of New Yorkers during the Jazz Age. Fitzgerald's writing is unassailably magnificent, as he paints a grim portrait of shallow characters who maneuver themselves into complex situations. It can definitely be appreciated and understood on some levels by teenagers. However, Fitzgerald's use of language and symbolism is best appreciated by mature readers able to analyze literature and think critically. Parents also need to know that some characters express racial and religious prejudice."
1324,Ian Cole,"After years of saying I was going to get around to it, I finally read  The Great Gatsby.  I honestly don’t know why it took me so long. My high school never had it on the reading list, so I missed out on it there. Most of my college English courses (and believe me, I took a lot of them!) assumed that we had already read it and thus left it off the reading list. And then, for some reason, I always decided to start reading it very late at night, finished one chapter, fell asleep, and forgot about it. But this time I decided I was going to make it all the way through – and am I ever happy that I did. Fitzgerald’s novel does a fantastic job of capturing America in the 1920s while also ruminating on such important subjects as the American Dream, classism, racism, the power of rumor, the power of appearances, marital fidelity (or lack thereof), and hope. Nick Carraway is an easy-going narrator. He has many deep observations throughout the novel and is almost always present within the scene (except when he describes circumstances from other’s accounts), but he tends to act mostly as a fly on the wall. He witnesses infidelity on the parts of both Tom and Daisy Buchanan, but he doesn’t do anything to alert either party. I found him to be almost journalistic in his approach – getting the juice of the story, but trying to remain inconspicuous and unbiased. Nevertheless, he does seem to take a rather scathing stance on the behavior of many of the moneyed people in West and East Egg. The ones in East Egg have primarily inherited their money and therefore have an unearned sense of entitlement and superiority. The ones in West Egg are nouveau riche and are overly showy and unrefined in their expressions of wealth – having had no experience with how to carry themselves. Gatsby seems to be the only one who manages to find some degree of immunity from this characterization, because Nick admires his commitment to his dream – the dream of Daisy.The beauty of  The Great Gatsby  is in Fitzgerald’s build-up. We only get whispers of Gatsby for the first few chapters. The rumors range from him having an association with the Germans during World War I to his having murdered a man. As the novel progresses, we learn more about this towering figure, but there is always an underlying sense that we are not being given the full truth. Nick often doubts what he hears, even when it is from Gatsby’s own mouth. This is because Gatsby is an invention of James Gatz. The man whom so many people claim to know has been designed for one purpose – to reconnect with the one woman who can make his American dream come true. He watches the green light from the end of his dock and knows that Daisy exists just across the water. Unfortunately, as with most dreams, the reality can hardly live up to them. There are too many complications for Gatsby to ever achieve his dream. Yet, the beauty of Gatsby is that he does not accept that. His vision may falter at some moments and circumstance may drive him to times of despair, but up until the end, he believes that he and Daisy can have a life together. No matter how he has been corrupted in the past, he will not allow that thought to be corrupted. It is an admirable quality that makes him supremely tragic in my estimation. I found myself caring for Nick and Gatsby, while most of the others had too many personality flaws to really gain empathy (Daisy had moments, but as I thought about them, I decided that I cared for her more because Gatsby cared for her, rather than based on her own merits). She is tragic as well, but because I felt like she abandoned Gatsby twice, I lost my sympathy for her. What makes this book so impressive to me, however, is that I can imagine changing my opinion entirely on a second reading. "
1325,Hoover Public Library Adult Fiction,"When I picked this book to read for our Book Discussion Groups, I just assumed that I had read it in High School. I knew the story. But when I opened the pages, I discovered that not only had I not read it ever before but I was inextricably drawn into the story of Jay Gatsby and his high-flying but tragic life. I was thrilled to be in the ""Roaring Twenties"" on the shore in Long Island swept away by the atmosphere and music of the age. The narrator, Nick Carraway, is a most admirable storyteller. Although told from memory two years after the incidents described, the reader is convinced of Nick's honesty and fidelity to the story. Daisy Buchanan is seen as an ethereal beauty for whom material happiness is a given and so is the love bestowed upon her by others. Nick takes the time to analyze the actions of these ultra-rich individuals and the view of them is ultimately not a favorable one. For Jay Gatsby, the wealth is newly attained and for Daisy and her husband Tom, the wealth is of the generations. The conflict arises early on when Jay manipulates Nick into a meeting between Jay and Daisy. I won't give away the ending but I will say that I was tantilized by the scandal that brings down Gatsby and ultimately convinces Nick to return back West to his place of origin."
1326,Ray,"I've read this novel three times at different periods in my life and found it to be one of the best things I've ever read. Forget the damned ""required reading"" and ""American Classic"" tags and enjoy it for its lyrical beauty. "
1327,Rose,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It took me a few hours to read it & I felt like I was listening to a great story teller the whole time & hung on his every word. Luckily I didn't have to read this in school & thus had the freedom to pick it up now & read it for my own pleasure & not because I had to. I loved the writing, it was poetic & lyrical & soft in its beauty. It just flowed smoothly like the words were always meant to be grouped just so. It painted such a vivid picture of that time you could practically hear the jazz music in the background & see the women's silky dresses swirling in mid dance. The character of Jay Gatsby was a wonderful one to read about & as his story unfolds you're helplessly lost in the book & there's no stopping till you reach the end. Seeing it all through Nick's eyes is touching & just plain lovely & he was a great character as well. I eagerly gave the movie a chance after finishing the book but it was awful. All except Robert Redford. Never again will I watch that, but the book I'll definitely read again someday. "
1328,Britt Skrabanek,"Like most people out there, I first read Gatsby when I was WAY too young and immature to understand it. All I remember was the boozing by the depressing ensemble, and I always thought Daisy was too whiny.I was swept off my feet by Baz Luhrmann's fresh take on the classic story in movie form. I'm always a fan of his films as I connect with his avant garde depiction of life—laced with color, beauty, and romance but also despair, violence, and loss.So, I gave The Great Gatsby another chance. I'm glad that I did.Perhaps in me, it's the writer or the adult that changed my perspective. It's a bit of a shame that so many of us were required to read it before we could even begin to envision the scope of Fitzgerald's work. Unfortunately I think this in itself, that memory of the confused and angsty teen mind unable to grasp the pages, has tainted Gatsby for many readers.I can see how this story wouldn't be for everyone.The American dream—that endless vortex of greed, power, and lust—can be a heavy subject to absorb. The characters are unlikable, which is not what we typically enjoy. But, that only means that Fitzgerald did his job well. We were not meant to take sides, we were meant to see Gatsby's topsy-turvy world just as it was...no sugar-coating, no happy ending.I appreciated the honesty of this work and I feel it deserves a respectful nod even if it's not somebody's cup of tea.And, holy hell, the closing sentence was one of the most brilliant I've ever read...“So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.” Britt Skrabanekhttp://brittskrabanek.com"

1330,Joseph,"My third reading of this classic, just on the heels of finishing Maureen Corrigan's So We Read On: How The Great Gatsby Came to Be and Why It Endures, confirmed much of what she wrote about the novel. The things I took away from this reading were quite different from what I got out of Fitzgerald's work when I was a younger man. Longing for an unattainable past? Regret? These are more powerful themes to someone past middle age than they are to a high school student or a college freshman. Yes, this work endures. "
1331,Mayday Maddie,"""The Great Gatsby"" is one of those books that deserves the term ""classic."" Much of classic lit isn't really as incredible as its merit implies -- and here I find another exception.In addition to the insightful ponderings of Fitzgerald and powerful language, there is a driving storyline and ending with a twist... Making the story a triple-threat. The ideals expressed in the novel truly reflect human nature and its faults. Namely, the way many become fixated on the perfect moment of the past, so much as to constantly seek it.Too many insights for now -- don't want to spoil the book! Well worth the read on rainy day with an empty head."
1332,Tony Go,"That was Friday night and this was the following Wednesday. After a semi-successful night together she might have asked me to have lunch the next day. I say might because the lunch in question never happened. I didn’t wait by the phone or anything- next to Battlefield 1942 matches and homework, my days were plenty filled with equal parts excitement and disappointment. I think it was one week in total that I then decided to write the letter. The ill-fated letter I no doubt expect to hear about long after my charisma has worked its way into fame. The poorly worded, poorly planned, and poorly delivered letter. I had a shot right? So did Lloyd Dobbler and so did every erstwhile Romeo-type before him right? With this hollywood logic I sent the letter away and piloted my virtual T-34 into a crumbled Stalingrad. Fitzgerald was never more right. Maybe I wasn’t exactly the Gatsby haphazardly thrust into a glamourous world of unscrupulous persons, but something about the dichotomy of dissimilar worlds rang so loudly with my own amateur parable. You see, Beth was in so many ways a different girl than those I had been with before. Her obvious popularity at odds with my own, I could hardly picture an event where our combined presence wasn’t met with some sort of undeserved curiosity. It was never my equestrian duty to determine the compatibility of Elizabeth and myself. Yet I don’t imagine I ever got tired of waiting for her to write me back. What was the point in that?If we were to examine Gatsby in the aftermath of Fitzgerald’s novel, I’d like to think we’d find someone quite like myself: someone still adapting to a new world even after the world had already adapted to him. In this great way we find Gatsby at the relevant center of anyone who’s ever “been there” to have “done that”. I will say that part of me, the reticent boy from another world, still wonders how he fits into his scene. Far removed from what he thought at the time was his Daisy and now writing inconsistent book reviews for the very audience that was so new to him that same long while ago, I beat on. "
1333,Bruce Snell,"In response to the old adage that every person is the star in his own life story, I often said that my life was so boring that I was only a bit player in my life story. Reading this book I was struck by the idea that Nick Carraway tells the story in first person, but it is the story of Gatsby and his obsessive love for Daisy, thus Nick reduces himself to the role of bit player in his own story.Through the first half of the book I was ready to give it a review of ""big deal"" and question why it is so revered in literature. The second half brought me around and made me a believer. There is nothing I can say except that this story will stick with me for a long time; I will think about Gatsby whose entire life is built on a fantasy of love. I will remember the shallowness of Daisy and the blindness (and double standards) of Tom Buchanan and I will remember Nick, the passive observer who finds himself as the only person who cares in the end.This might be a short book, but it leaves a big imprint."
1334,Mora,"I believe this author is from Minnesota. So there's not much bad that I can say about him. Same category as Garrison Keillor's ""Pontoon."" I'm pretty biased towards Minnesotans. I mean look at Randy Moss and Kevin Garnett. We are just amazing people."
1335,J Omar Vidrio,"Un libro que nos habla del amor, el dinero, la amistad, la familia y nuestras acciones hacia con nuestros allegados. F. Scott Fitzgerald plasmó tantas cosas en éste libro que es difícil, nombrarlas todas a la vez de que en sus simbolismos podemos interpretar infinidad de mensajes. Sin duda su exquisita y armoniosa narrativa atrapa ademas de darle un toque especial a está historia."
1336,Luke Eggers,"The Great Gatsby has to be one of the best and most well known novels that Fitzgerald has ever written. The novel is a tragic story about money, secrets, and a forbidden love. Nick is the narrator of the story. He lives next door to Gatsby's mansion and is the cousin of his love interest, Daisy. Daisy and her husband, Tom lived across the lake from Nick and Gatsby, and Gatsby would watch over there every night. Tom was having an affair with a woman named Myrtle Wilson. In the end, Gatsby was seen as a bootlegger and did not get Daisy. As they were driving back from the city, Daisy struck Myrtle, killing her, but Gatsby took the blame. When Tom found out he instructed Myrtle's husband on how to find Gatsby and bing bang boom, Gatsby and Myrtle's husband are dead. Daisy and Tom run off leaving only Nick and Gatsby's father at his funeral. The story ended with showing that love doesn't always work out the way one may want it too, and the fight for forbidden love can lead to ones ultimate downfall."
1337,Pilo_poly,"Judul : The Great gatsbyPenulis : F. Scott FitzgeraldPenerbit : SerambiISBN : 978-979-024-192-3Resensor : Pilo PolyThe Great Gatsby: Sebuah Cinta Yang DalamLahir dalam keluarga kelas menengah ke atas, F. Scoot Fitzgeral telah berhasil menjadikan tulisan-tulisannya terkenal di seluruh dunia. Dengan segala metafora yang berebutan ke hadapan pembaca, tak salah jika novel yang bertajuk The Great Gatsby menjadi salah satu bacaan standar dalam pelajaran literatur di Amerika.Dengan mengambil sudut pandang orang pertama, F. Scoot Fitzgeral mencoba memaparkan segala bentuk kemegahan dan kekayaan orang-orang kaya baru, yang meruntuhkan nila-nilai sosial dan moral dalam sinisme, keserakahan dan hawa nafsu. Hal tersebut terekam dari seorang Nick Carraway –pendatang baru di New York yang dipercaya untuk menyimpan segala rahasia dari orang di sekitarnya- yang berpokus pada seorang lelaki misterius bernama Jay Gatsby. Tokoh sentral yang memendam cinta pada Daisy. Orang yang akhirnya menikah dengan seorang lelaki berpendidikan tinggi, kaya dan berperangai kasar, Tom Buchanan. “Kenapa mereka datang ke East, aku tidak tahu. Mereka pernah tinggal setahun di Prancis tanpa alasan khusus, kemudian mereka merantau kesana-sini dengan tergesa-gesa, kemana pun tempat orang bermain polo dan orang kaya berkumpul bersama.” (Hal 15).Tumpah dengan segala hal berbau perumpamaan, The Great Gatsby lagi-lagi membuat hentakan di dalam setiap babnya. Penggunaan metafora yang selalu memukau membuat pembaca mungkin banyak terkagum-kagum termasuk saya. Hal ini dapat ditemukan di bab-bab berikutnya yang mulai membara. “Tiba-tiba dia menunjuk ke arahku dan setiap orang memandangku dengan tatapan menuduh. Aku berusaha menunjukkan dengan ekspresiku bahwa aku tidak memiliki peran apapun pada masa lalunya.” (Hal. 59).Dalam perjalanannya, Nick Carraway merekam setiap tindak tanduk teman-teman barunya itu. Salah seorang adalah Lucille, perempuan yang hanya senang berpesta dan tak perduli dengan apa yang ia lakukan. Bahkan dari perempuan itu juga Nick Carraway mendengar desas-desus bahwa Jay Gatsby pernah membunuh seseorang. Tapi apa yang didengar oleh Nick Carraway dari mulut Lucille itu tidak ditelan mentah-mentah. Hari-hari berikutnya banyak hal lain yang ditemukan Nick dalam kehidupan seorang Jay Gatsby. “Aku Infanteri Ketujuh hingga Juni 1918. Aku tahu aku pernah melihatmu di suatu tempat sebelumnya.” (Hal. 76).Novel yang diterbitkan kembali pada Oktober 2010 oleh penerbit Serambi ini, begitu banyak membuat hentakan demi hentakan. Salah satunya saat seorang Jay Gatsby menayakan pendapat tentang dirinya sendiri dari Nick Carrayaw. Ia tak mau Nick Carraway mendapatkan gambaran yang salah tentang dirinya dari cerita orang-orang. Dan dengan begitu lancar, Jay Gatsby menjelaskan tentang dirinya pada Nick Carraway dalam sebuah mobil berwarna cream dengan cerah nikel. “Aku adalah putra orang kaya di Middle West –semuanya sudah meninggalkan sekarang. Aku dibesarkan di Amerika, tetapi belajar di Oxfod karena semua nenek moyangku belajar di sana sejak jaman dulu. ini sudah menjadi tradisi keluarga.” (Hal. 102).Namun semakin banyak mendengar dan mengenal seorang Jay Gatsby, semakin banyak pula rahasia yang harus disimpan oleh Nick Carraway. Belakangan Nick juga tahu bahwa kedekatan Jay Gatsby dengan dirinya tak lain dari rencana Jay Gatsby untuk dipertemukan dengan Daisy. Perempuan yang lembut itu, walau sudah menikah dengan seorang lelaki kaya raya, belum dapat dilupakan oleh Jay Gatsby. Menurutnya, hanya karena Daisylah, Jay Gatsby sering mengadakan pesta di rumahnya dan berharap suatu saat Daisy akan muncul di tengah-tengah pesta itu. “Sudah bertahun-tahun kami tidak bertemu,” kata Daisy, suaranya sebisa mungkin terdengar biasa. (Hal. 134).Novel ini sendiri ditutup dengan kematian Jay Gatsby yang menurut Nick Carraway terlalu didramatisir. Segala beritu yang kemudian mencuat adalah pembohongan belaka. Nick juga menemukan dirinya sendiri membela dan berdiri sendiri di pihak Jay Gatsby itu. Bahkan orang-orang yang kerap datang ke pestanya saban minggu tak satu pun yang berhadir saat pemakaman berlangsung. Kecuali ayah Jay Gatsby yang datang dari sebuah kota di Minnesota, dan sangat terpukul dengan kejadian itu. “Setelah kematian Gatsby, East menjadi angker seperti itu bagiku. Jadi, saat asap biru daun-daun yang rapu berterbangan di udara dan angin meniupkan pakaian basah yang kaku pada tali-tali jemuran, aku memutuskan untuk pulang ke rumah.” (Hal. 269).*"
1338,Samuel,"So I read this book in the eleventh grade and remembered enjoying it for its historical references (the Black Sox scandal in 1919 for instance). After the excitement over the newest adaptation of the novel, Alyssa and I decided to re-read it: so the nearest we got to doing so was listening to it ""on-tape"" whilst driving over the past few weeks. I forgot how clever Fitzgerald's syntax is; each sentence is masterfully crafted and intentionally composed. The story itself is fairly common dealing in love triangles, yearning for the past, and so forth, but the execution of the story and its association with such a historically romanticized time period is what makes this one of the best American novels of all-time. Nick Carraway is the perfect narrator in that your attention is not fixated on him and yet his retelling the events from his own perspective and experiences makes it much more personal and powerful. The rich are overly-characterized as careless and ignorant, but their one-dimensional nature clarifies one of the main themes of the novel: the American Dream has its limits and social classes have not disappeared in ""free"" society. Even more striking in my opinion is the theme of foolishly living in pursuit of the past. Gatsby himself does this most noticeably in his psychotic pursuit of forcing his past infatuation [Daisy] to renounce her family and love in order to get back to an idealized past, but almost all characters exhibit some sort of struggle with seeking after a romanticized past: Tom with his boyish competitive sporting activities, Wilson with his failing marriage and garage, and Daisy with her careless pursuit of pleasure void of responsibility. It is perhaps this theme more than any other that is so universally experienced by all that explains why this book resonates with such a diverse group of readers. For it is very difficult to hope for anything better than what we have already experienced, but it is of course very courageous and worthwhile in my humble opinion to do so. And so I will conclude with perhaps my favorite conclusion in all of literature:“So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”"
1339,Alex Fimbianti,"I am absolutely in love with this novel. I've read it multiple times and each time I have found no faults with it. If I was gonna sum up the novel in one sentence it would be ""Every character is intertwined because of affairs with one another and they love to party."" To be serious though, the novel is about a man who goes from rags to riches and still wants the girl he fell in love with many years prior but can't have her. The story is told form the point of view of Nick Carraway, Jay Gatsby's new neighbor and friend. Even though this novel became immensely popular after the movie came out recently, I do think that the text does the story line a better justice than the movie screen. When it comes to whether or not I think this novel is a teachable one within my classroom, I do think that it entails all of the components needed to be a successful novel in a high school classroom. it has a plot, the characters are easy to follow and the themes throughout the novel are appropriate. The only thing I could see holding me back from teaching this novel is the movie. The movie is a very accurate showing of the text and doesn't differ from the storyline at all. This could cause potential problems with students watching the movie and not doing the reading. "
1340,Timothy Bartel,"Not quite the great American novel (that's Moby Dick, right?), but so very good; the plot is just common enough, just complex enough; the prose sets a standard that few had lived up to. I'm sad no one made me read it in high school."
1341,Megan Kaeb,"I had never read The Great Gatsby and had no idea what it was about. The movie previews piqued my interest, so I checked it out of the library. I loved it. The writing is so well crafted and the characters, so very flawed, have stayed with me for sometime. While somewhat of a depressing read, it is a book I have mulled over and thought about long after I finished. Frankly, it is a book I am planning on purchasing and reading over again, this time with a pen ready to underline as I go. (I'd also like to buy a biography/autobiography of F.Scott Fitzgerald and read more of his work, I feel slightly obsessed.) "
1342,Anne Meike Tolsma,"The first time I read Gatsby I was 14 - I read it because I wanted to start reading classics and there was a movie adaptation of Gatsby coming so it made sense for me to read this. I was extremely disapointed. I expected this amazing, big, extravagant, party story. None of this came, however. I felt as if I'd missed something in the book, because so many people love, adore, worship it.Last week I felt the urge to reread it. And this time I wasn't disapointed. On the contrary, I absolutely love it now! I finally understood the value of its simplicity, the beautifully written sentences! I finally understood why everybody loves it, why it is considered a classic. And let's face it, this story in this amaaazing edition - it even comes with a matching bookmark - is irresistible. Well done Penguin and Coralie Bickford-Smith!!"
1343,Rachael Szydlowski,daisy sucks! I'm still too emotional to say anything more.
1344,Jenna Burns,"SPOILERS AHEAD!After finishing this, I watched author John Green's 'The Great Gatsby crash course' videos and I highly recommend them; they really helped me to deepen my understanding of the novel.I'm so glad I read this before seeing the new film, I really hope the film does the book justice.The Great Gatsby very easily lulled me into a false sense of security. Of course, I got the sense that it would be a far from 'happy ever after' type story but...I did not expect (view spoiler)[Gatsby's death. (Perhaps Fitzgerald should've made the title 'The Late Gatsby' to soften the blow!)Perhaps the bleakest ending I've read so far...not that I'm complaning, it just made the novel even more interesting! (hide spoiler)]I watched the trailers for the film after reading this and, in my opinion, the trailers very much remind you of the drama/epic scale of the events and setting of The Great Gatsby. This aspect is not lost in the novel but to me, the prose conveys it more subtly, which I enjoyed.Overall, this book made me fall in love (view spoiler)[and then fall out love(!) (hide spoiler)] with the American jazz age and consider just how 'great' Gatsby's 'dream' (and indeed, our own) really is...P.S: Oh, and Gatsby also says 'old sport', a lot i.e. all the time. "
1345,Chenzidai,"Hemingway in the ""movable feast"", said bluntly, Scott Fitzgerald (f. Scott Fitzgerald) was destroyed by women. This is unfair, women made him; a woman also destroyed him. Great people are always destroyed by his things, and no exception; And most of them are the anonymity, just because don't have to their achievement."

It faced, or seemed to face, the whole external world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself.""I was assigned this book to read in high school, and that usually predisposed me to dislike a book or not to read it at all when I was younger. I'm so glad that I read it by choice years later. I'm not sure if I learned much from it or if it made me a better person, but I really enjoyed reading The Great Gatsby. "
1348,Karla Iniguez ,"The Great Gatsby es una novela muy corta, pero posee un estilo narrativo exquisito. Creo que nunca había leído algo mejor escrito que este libro, y por eso se merece las cinco estrellas.Los personajes están muy bien definidos, Nick es el hombre honesto de la novela, y aunque Gatsby esté corrompido, no es alguien malvado. Siento que el libro se hubiera convertido en ""romántico"" si no fuera por el hecho de que Daisy no estaba preparada para entregarse completamente a Gatsby. Y eso está bien. Es trágico que la adoración de Gatsby por Daisy terminara siendo su perdición, pero sinceramente, no puedo imaginar un final alternativo. Un final en el que ellos dos tuvieran una vida larga y feliz, eternamente enamorados.Lo bueno es que este no es un libro romántico, sino una crítica a la superficialidad de la sociedad."
1349,Jeremiah,"The great american novel. Shows a person can become anything they want given the right, if not misplaced, motivation. And yet, no matter how far we come, the past will always be there. Are we who we are, or who we were, or just who others make us out to be?"
1350,Ed,"Disappointment is an unfortunate fact of life; thankfully this literary classic was not one. Many things certainly can trigger disappointment: someone's actions, a new car, a vacation spot, a meal at a restaurant, a show, a movie. The list is almost endless. If the source of the disappointment is something that has won widespread praise you may wonder during or after your experience what all the fuss was about. High expectations often can lead to major letdowns.When I began reading The Great Gatsby I was well aware of the high esteem the book enjoys in the literary world. It was a book I had long-planned to read and somehow never did despite its brief length. One quarter of the way through the book I had the dreaded sense that this was going to be a literary disappointment for me as Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises proved to be. Yes I could appreciate Fitzgerald's writing talent but I could not help but wonder why it has been consistently ranked one of the greatest works of American literature.And then the magic happened. The book which had started so slowly soon picked up tempo so that by the time I finished it I felt I had been taken on a wonderful journey. It amazes me that Fitzgerald could create such an incredible tale and such fascinating characters in a mere 180 pages. This is the story of Jay Gatsby's rise from his humble origins to a life of great wealth, of his obsessive and doomed love for Daisy Buchanan, a love that ultimately results in his downfall. Though set in Jazz Age Prohibition-era 1922 in the fictional village of West Egg, Long Island, the story has an almost timeless quality about the rewards and dangers of pursuing the American dream.The story is told through the eyes of Gatsby's next-door neighbor, Nick Carraway, a bond salesman, who like Gatsby served in World War I. While Nick appears to live a modestly comfortable life, living in a small house that he rents, Gatsby’s home is a lavish mansion where he frequently holds extravagant parties. The two men become friends after Nick attends one of Gatsby's elaborate gatherings. Nick's presence at this event and the brilliant images the author used to depict the party scene was for me the point when the pace of the story began to accelerate. In hindsight I now appreciate that Fitzgerald in the measured first forty plus pages was setting the stage for what would follow.Gatsby's efforts to reignite the love affair he had with Daisy five years earlier and to convince her to leave her husband is of course the centerpiece of this story. At one point Nick warns his friend of the futility of pursuing Daisy by simply stating, ""You can't repeat the past."" To this Gatsby cries back incredulously ""Can't repeat the past? But of course you can!"" This stubborn blindness and refusal to let go of the past drives Gatsby's every movement which sets in motion events that have tragic consequences. By the time the novel ends, it becomes evident how shallow, dishonest and self-absorbed all of the characters are with the notable exception of Nick. Early in the novel, Nick makes this comment about himself which by story's end proves quite accurate. ""Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.""This is truly a masterful story with so many memorable quotes. Here are a few of my favorites:""I like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.""""I’ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.""“There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind.""""The rich get richer and the poor get - children.""""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.""“So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.” The novel's final sentence.This was a novel which had little in common with the book I am writing but has so inspired me to be a better writer. Thank you Mr. Fitzgerald. I feel forever indebted to you."
1351,Rachelle,"Read the ""About me"" section before proceeding.. Great Gatsby shows us how the roaring twenties are like. Soldiers and war veterans are coming back to United States; so this 20s time in the book is a return to ""normalcy"". It also shows you the Prohibition Act that was ratified in the year 1920. Gatsby was later on revealed to be a bootlegger which are liquor smugglers that gets their alcohol from bordering countries and selling alcohol under the counter. Gatsby was very ambitious man coming from the middle-class then suddenly to a millionaire. I think what ruined him was because he cannot move on from his past life. I don't know if Gatsby ever really loved Daisy for who she is or he loved the idea of her. Daisy is a very wealthy lady and charming. I love how the weather goes with the feeling of the scenes in the book. In the end I felt bad for Gatsby that no one but his dad and Nick attended his funeral. My favorite quote from this book is  “The loneliest moment in someone’s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.” If you ever want to try a classic novel then I suggest read this book, old sport (:
Happy Reading!
"
1352,Rainey,"Fitzgerald first came into my life in high school, not as a reading assignment but at the urging of a teacher. She suggested that I would enjoy the read, and she was absolutely spot-on. At the time, I had never read any books that took place in teh Jazz Age, and, being about 15 years old, I romanticized it for all the bright lights and carefree (or careless) nights. Gatsby introduced meto a style of writing I couldn't have imaged- so far removed from the Austen and Wilde that I'd already tackled. I'll never forget my love affair with this book."
1353,Kaitybelle,Well golly I actually enjoyed reading a required book. His writing style... holy crap. 
1354,Casey Lansinger,"Oh Fitzgerald...pg. 8""And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees - just as things grow in fast movies - I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.""pg. 40""I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life."" pg. 52""He smiled understandingly - much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four of five times in life. It faced - or seemed to face - the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished - and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself I'd got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care."" pg. 62""At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others - poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner - young clerks in the dusk, waiting the most poignant moments of their night and life."" pg. 84""There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired."" pg. 101""No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart."" pg. 117""He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God.

But there was Jordan beside me who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age."" "
1355,Inna,"The Great Gatsby is a beautifully written story about dreams, love, illusions and disillusionment, about the fake values of the modern society. Jay Gatsby is a tragically romantic character. He dedicated his life to fulfilling a dream, which proved itself worthless but Gatsby failed to realize that till the very end.I love the exquisitely melancholic style or Fitzgerald. I found myself re-reading passages just to experience their beauty again. "
1356,daisy,"Fitzgerald transports you back in time to the Roaring 20’s, a time of indulgence, partying, and insincerity. At the heart of the story is Mr. Gatsby, whose love for married woman Daisy Buchanan has withstood five long years apart. The omnipresent narrator enhances the overall emotion of the story, which, as a reader, was a major high point of the novel. The narrator's shrewd but insightful comments show an incredible range of emotion which truly makes the story come to life. Aside from the plot, Fitzgerald writes with the elegance of a poet. His grocery lists probably read like sonnets, including the rhyme scheme. Although the story takes place 90 years ago, the characters’ lives and struggles will be easy to relate to today."
1357,Kayley Mckay,"	“The Great Gatsby,” is a novel that is loved by many generations of readers and I’m certain that you will enjoy reading it too. It was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald and is known as one of the great American classics of 20th century literature. I really like “The Great Gatsby” because it is a modernist novel that takes place during the Jazz Age. It perfectly portrays the decline of the American dream in the 1920s and exposes the emptiness and moral decay of upper class life on the East Coast. It was first published in 1925, a time when the economy soared and prohibition made millionaires out of bootleggers.	The story unfolds through Nick Carraway’s point of view. Nick moved from Minnesota to a community for the newly wealthy known as the West Egg of Long Island. He graduated from Yale, fought in WWII and wanted to learn the bond business in New York. He is a honest man and has reserved judgment. People easily trust him with their secrets throughout the novel. In the West Egg, Nick befriends his neighbor Jay Gatsby. Gatsby, a man who dedicated his life to becoming wealthy, is well-known in Long Island for the lavish parties he throws in his mansion.	As the relationship between Gatsby and Nick is strengthened, Nick finds out Gatsby is in love with his cousin Daisy. Daisy Buchanan met Gatsby at a training camp in Louisville. They fell in love and she promised to wait for him when he went to war. She eventually gave up on waiting and married a wealthy, arrogant and hypocritical man of the old aristocratic community of Long Island known as the East Egg. I didn’t like him because he tended to not live up to the standards of morality he demanded from others. The moral conflicts are revealed when superficial socialites are caught hiding the pain of infidelity.	Nick is introduced to Daisy’s friend Jordan Baker near the time of his arrival. She is a cynical and self-centered competitive golfer who is eventually set up with Nick. She is beautiful but often bends the truth. Jordan tells Nick about Tom’s affair with a lady named Myrtle. Myrtle Wilson is a curvy woman who lives above her husband’s auto shop in a place referred to as the Valley of Ashes. The place is an important setting because it defines what the American dream is not. The ruin of the community perfectly reveals the false aspects of the American dream. Myrtle is ashamed to live there because Tom is wealthy. She uses the affair to create a classy and sophisticated image that many people of the 1920s longed to reflect. However, nobody buys the disguise. I think the book is a good read because many people can relate to Myrtle when she pretended to be something she is not. 	The fast paced style of writing excites the reader and makes you want to flip to the last page to find out how the story turns out. Many can relate to numerous issues the characters face. Nick eventually rekindles the love that Daisy had for Gatsby. This made me extremely happy when I was reading the book. Fitzgerald wrote, “His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips touch, she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.” Fitzgerald’s description of their kiss was so intimate and beautiful that it made me wonder if he took this from personal experience. It wasn’t a cheesy love scene we often read in current novels. The phrasing is perfection. I remember reading that part over and over. I’m sure you will too.	As the situations and conversations become more heated, things get complicated. When Tom learns of Gatsby and Daisy, things begin to get messy. I enjoyed reading about the loose atmosphere of Gatsby’s red-carpet-like parties. It was also entertaining to read about the tension between Tom and Daisy at the dinner table. Some of the details I’m not giving away will really catch you off guard. It’s a thrilling adventure. In the end, Nick realizes Gatsby’s dream of Daisy was destroyed by dishonesty and money just like the American dream of individualism and happiness has disintegrated into a pursuit of wealthiness. Nick concludes that Gatsby’s ability to transform his dreams into reality is what makes him “great” and like Gatsby’s dream, the American dream is over. Fitzgerald’s great American classic appeals to anyone with good taste. The upbeat social scene of New York in the 1920s is appealing in itself! I think many can make personal connections with some of the conflicts the characters struggle with throughout this lovely novel. I highly recommend this one. It’s pretty great!"
1358,Karly *The Vampire Ninja & Luminescent Monster*,"My musings on The Great Gatsby This is a book that is impossible to review without spoilers. It's a love affair with money, with entitlement, with consumerism. The characters are horrid but in this poetically beautiful way. Fitzgerald was a genius. He creates these unforgivably entitled characters that just annihilate anything they come into contact with. I just want to punch all of them. Also, I would like to punch whoever made the movie. The movie completely ignores the main theme of the book making the cold and beautiful character of Daisy into this trilling little waif who appears to have a mental disorder. Ugh, Daisy and I have this love hate relationship because she is completely unforgivable and I really think that would have been an amazing acting opportunity but alas no.Tom brings to mind an oversized toddler having a temper tantrum because his sister got a bigger slice of pie or whatever. He's just terrible (but again in an amazing way) I could go on and on and on but I won't do that. This book is brilliant, just read it!"
1359,Elizabeth Wu,"Ambitious, thoughtful, and dubbed as the “supreme American classic”, The Great Gatsby is one of the most brilliantly captured stories of 20th century America of all time. The simple but tragic story starts as we enter 20th century America, into a young man named Nick Carraway’s life after he moves to the glamorous West Egg, filled with luxury, wealth, and status obsessed people. As the story unfolds, he finds himself caught in the middle of a group of extravagant but dysfunctional rich young adults, including the mysterious Jay Gatsby, all supposedly living “The American Dream”. When Carraway experiences the most traumatic moment of his life, the novel ends abruptly on a shocking note, leaving the reader to contemplate the story. Inventive, grasping, and haunting, Fitzgerald’s advanced characterization and crafted use of figurative languages will leave this story lurking in the reader’s mind. An epic perspective on the illusion of the American dream and America’s obsession with wealth and status, Fitzgerald’s pitch perfect voice weaves and unforgettable mix of characters and a stunningly controversial – but moralizing – story. The timeless underlying meanings and themes ensure that The Great Gatsby will remain a classic for many more decades to come. - Elizabeth Wu "
1360,Kiley Williams,"This will always be my favorite book. The Great Gatsby is a mysterious and glamorous tale of the struggles of the power of money, love, and relentless work. Although this is a story of how shallow people become once rich and treat others like objects, it is spoken about with such elegance. You quickly come to realize how ""perfect"" lives, are not ""perfect"" and can be quite toxic. It is a quick read and easily my favorite classic. Fitzgerald is one of the greatest writers of his time and is definitely my favorite author."
1361,Steven Langdon,"My daughter is studying ""The Great Gatsby"" this year, so I did a re-read of one of my favourites. It was even better than I remembered. Fitzgerald writes with such grace, his images sharp, his characterization memorable -- who could ever forget Gatsby himself, with his smooth style yet underlying vulnerability (""old sport."") The blunt nastiness of Tom Buchanan and the self-centred shallowness of his wife Daisy -- they stick in one's mind, as does Nick's ineffectual role as the paralyzed bystander, who agonizes but cannot act as the tragedy plays out. This is such a devastating social critique of the rich careless world of wealthy Jazz-age America, trampling the Mrytles and the Gatsbys who are both victims and symbols of the times.What a fine book this is, so many years after it was written! "
1362,Morgane,re-read in dec.2015 Just as good as the first time !! And those Penguin Editions !! OMFG they look gorgeous !!!!! 
1363,Lydia Presley,"May 2013 Review:Wow, what a difference a few years makes. In preparation for the upcoming movie, I picked up The Great Gatsby as the first pleasure of the summer. I remember being in a bit of a fog when I read the story back in 2010, and I think I sped through it quickly sometime in late 2011, but this time.. this time there was something special.I firmly believe that there are times when the right book is picked up for that time in your life. As I look forward to changes, from graduation to a move thousands of miles away, I needed a story that not only had lush imagery, but also heart-breaking tragedy. It wasn't necessarily that I felt strongly for any of the characters, although I did feel a bit of an affinity for Daisy Buchanan this time around, but instead I felt sorrow for how empty the life of Gatsby was. I think this is also because I have been immersed in the HBO series Boardwalk Empire (and that series first made me aware of the 1919 World Series story, which was mentioned in Gatsby!) and I have been made super-aware of how lavish life isn't all its cut out to be. Money does not power make, and this story is a prime-example of that. For all of his money, Gatsby never actually achieved or acquired what he wanted, and then when he made that decision to enter his pool in an attempt to actually enjoy a part of his life...well, you know. (Trying to stay away from spoilers - even though this is an older book.)I cannot wait to see the spin that Leo DiCaprio puts on Gatsby and I think that the descriptions and over-the-top style that makes this book such a beautiful thing will translate well to the screen.January 2010 Review:I'm really, unacceptably late in reading this novel. I've heard about it and had a general idea of what the plot was but, for some reason or another, never actually sat down to read through it.Although it's relatively short at 180 pages it took me a good day to chew my way through it. I loved how simple but completely immersed I became through setting - from the very start. Images from movies, pictures and my own imagination filled my head throughout my reading experience. At times it was so intense I could almost hear the voices and the clinking of glasses during one of Gatsby's parties.It's fascinating to me how very little there was to the actual story but the book seems so full. There's scandal, romance, heartbreak and tragedy all wrapped up in these pages and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of reading it. It's always a little daunting approaching a classic and knowing that when you put it down you plan to review it - because everyone takes something different from each book. What I took from this book was vivid imagery and the satisfaction of now knowing what others are talking about when they speak of it."
1364,Megan Olivier,This has to be one of my favourite classics now. I am so glad I had to read this for my English Literature course because otherwise who knows when I would have finally picked it up on my own. I would highly recommend that you give this book a go if you have ever considered getting into more classics. I found it highly entertaining and Fitzgerald's description of characters is hilarious. The themes and messages are absolutely excellent. I would love to do a video on this book if any of you would be interested. Excuse me while I got and order me some more Fitzgerald...
1365,Graeme Pitman,"""I couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.""3rd Reading."
1366,Ashleyj Brown,One of the best books I've read. Read it in high school and again in college for one of my teaching english classes. A great book filled with symbols.
1367,Elkarreneskutik,"As a reader who had previously watched the film released one year ago (2013), I have to say that both the film and the book made me feel like only good stories can. I won't go into details considering that the book was published in 1925 and all what is to be said about it is already online. However, I would like to remark that the book is a masterpiece due to the story it tells while the film goes beyond that and includes some remarkable details. For instance, for me one of these were the phone call before ""the swimming pool incident"" and the feeling left behind on Gatsby.Finally, I would love to thank the translators of the movie (English to Spanish) for the ""pun"" at the funeral. The sentence ""From Daisy, not even a flower"" was translated as ""From Daisy not even a daisy"" (De Daisy ni una margarita), making it an irrelevant sentence for the ones who did not get that ""margarita"" was indeed a daisy. While reading the book I was looking forward to reach these precise points and see if they were like in the movie. Actually, I have discovered that the last one was just an undercover detail of the translators a few minutes before writing this down.I guess that in the end we all have our stories to tell; writers, film directors, translators, or simple readers :)"
1368,Emily Yelencich,"So, so beautiful. One that definitely gets better the more times it is read. Fitzgerald really exercises his literary voice, using a lot of foreshadowing and tricky character development to point the reader towards the tragic outcome. While a fairly common story, the subtleties that he sneaks in and the grand scale of the characters' world exacerbate the facades in life that are ultimately punctured by reality's minutia. Fitzgerald's choice and development of the narrator (Nick) is brilliant, providing a trustworthy, if at times ambiguous constant in the novel. There are layers upon layers to be dealt with regarding the class situations in this novel. One of the more moving parts is when Gatsby's father comes to the house. Also, race is an interesting topic. It's a very homogeneous cast, but there are moments when Fitzgerald acknowledges this fact in tiny moments and ways that further the reader's sense that this is a closed bubble, built outside of most of the world's reality. Ultimately, this book makes me pretty sad...of the survivors it seems that no one learned any lessons, aside from Nick, who was on the suspicious/critical side anyway. Kind of a bleak look at the potential people have to learn and grow in life when they have the resources and privilege to turn away, shirk responsibility and move along, back into comfortability. "
1369,Meghan,"After receiving this book for Easter last year, it took all my strength to wait until school started to read it. From the very first page, I fell in love. It was nearly impossible for me to put it down. Needless to say, it has become my favorite book."
1370,Larry,"I don’t think I ever read The Great Gatsby before. Too bad. (If it was required in high school, I don’t think I could have appreciated it.) I was hook in the first couple of pages…“Sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed.” What imagery! Fitzgerald was a great writer – and what a command of the language! The words just flow. Also, it’s vocabulary used to its fullest. Where else can you read “orgiastic future”? The descriptions are so good, the reader doesn’t need to care about the story. There are such wonderful insights on subtle emotions.Still, Gatsby is a GREAT character and the story is one of lost love with the addition on the author’s observations of living in the East and the ultra-rich. I WILL read it again. "
1371,Sinead,"I found this book so hard to read, understand and interperite. I probably didn´t understand a lot of it but I guess that´s what rereading is for. And don´t think that by saying that it was a hard read that it wasn´t enjoyable. It was thoroughly enjoyable. I really do love this book. I love the story, how beautifully written it is, particularly the use of symbolise. I like books with symbolism a lot, and I like books that make me think, and thus I think The Great Gatsby and F. Scott Fitzgerald are excellent, and nothing short of genius. When I finished it I got the same feeling you get when you have to leave a place that you love terribly and really do not want to leave, and personally I take that as a very good sign."
1372,Tashana Story,"I am a senior and high school , and as a independent project I chose to read ""The Great Gatsby"". After watching the the 2013 remake of the movie I figured that the book would be just as amazing. Starting to read my book I immediately noticed the stylistic techniques Fitzgerald used. He used many punctuations that broke up his sentence structure into short sentences and created dramatic pauses. Once I read through the entire book I realized that Fitzgerald used his stylistic choices to send the many messages of love through his audience. This book was written in 1925 in the heart of the Roaring twenties. Cultural and the economy were at its all time high and freedom to just be yourself and let loose reigned from everyone. Yet somehow Daisy was restrained from this freedom and caught in a web of fantasy. Fitzgerald used her as his pawn to show the complexity of love and who really loves from the heart. She became the women who in today's world found every reason to stay in a marriage because they were afraid to start over or believed they couldn't. That's why I enjoyed this book so much , because it could be supported with marital problems of today. Fitzgerald,in my opinion, wrote this book so that it could have present day relevance. His audience would be able to relate the situations that occurred on the text. Even though the book was written and published in 1925. "
1373,Jennifer Rayment,"Mini Book Review: A truly beautiful written novel of heartbreak, deception, excess and infidelity, set in the decadence of the 1920's. Fitzgerald's descriptions are so lifelike you feel like you could reach out and touch the landscape and he sets the mood and tone like no author I have read before. It is very much a critique of the shallowness of the supposed American Dream and done in such a brilliant way. That being said, I did find myself frustrated at the excessive descriptions and a little bored at times. I disliked most of the characters and I was disgusted by the parental neglect of Tom and Daisy's child. This quote sort of sums of the story""I couldn't forgive him or like him but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy - they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made ...""4.5 Dewey'sI read this as part of the BBC Top 100 Books Challenge. I borrowed this copy from the Humber College Library"
1374,Paolo,"Il Grande Gatsby è una di quelle opere che appaiono come per incantesimo: è un miracolo abbastanza mozartiano di economia di mezzi e felicità di risultati: nel Grande Gatsby si sa pochissimo (come ha fatto fortuna Gatsby ? - probabilmente illecitamente, ma la cosa importa poco finché organizza feste da mille e una notte, è stato in guerra o no ? come mai i protagonisti dai quattro angoli dell'America si ritrovano tutti nella stessa zona di New York ?), ma si capisce tutto di un'epoca, della vertiginosa ascesa di una nazione, della nascita di ricchezze immense, della gioia di vivere di un'epoca.Al tempo stesso un meraviglioso ritratto interiore di un'anima appassionata e fedele ad un ideale d'amore come un trovatore medioevale, che quando vuole ritrovare la felicità perduta inizia la discesa agli inferi, fino alla morte ed al subitaneo oblio di un uomo che il lettore invece non può non amare e dimenticare.Tutto questo in poco più di 150 pagine scritte da un ventinovenne, splendidamente tradotte da Fernanda Pivano, nella versione riveduta nel 2010 in occasione dell'uscita del discusso film di Luhrmann, mantenendo vivo il dono dell'eterna giovinezza che accomuna il libro, il protagonista e l'autore."
1375,Justin,"I now know for certain that my education in English literature has not been a waste. I first read The Great Gatsby several years ago, and I remember thinking that it must be a great book, but I just don't get it. I knew there was something meaningful there, but I was left with a big ""huh?""Fast forward a few years and one (nearly complete) English degree later, and I can't believe this is the same book. I suppose, in a way, it isn't. A book is nothing but meaningless symbols if there isn't someone there to interpret them, right? I now see that everything about The Great Gatsby - the prose, the characters, the allusions and metaphors and meanings - is spectacular. There's a lot going on here. I know that a lot of people read this book in grade school and subsequently dislike it, but I'd have you know that Gatsby is one of those rare creatures who will only be appreciated by his closest companions. Give him another chance when you're ready. You just may be pleasantly surprised. "
1376,Priyanka,"Beautiful prose and a poignant novel, which kept coming back to me for a whole day after reading it. One of my favourite books. As relevant today as it was in the 1920s. "
1377,Paola,"Si, me tomo una absurda eternidad terminar este libro, pero no porque no me gustara pues la verdad es que es uno de mis libros favoritos, sólo que tuve la mala suerte de dejarlo en otro sitio y no pude ir a buscarlo hasta el día de hoy.Mucha gente opina que lo que más valor le entrega a esta novela es lo corta que es, pues Fitzgerald logró en sólo 180 páginas desenvolver la historia incluyendo el transfonfo que dio lugar a los sucesos del presente (o pasado, ya que está escrito como las memorias de Nick) en la misma.Antes de leer el libro, siempre de algún modo había detestado el personaje de Daysi por su frivolidad, pero eventualmente durante la lectura comprendí que eso es lo que ella representa. Y principalmente que el pasado no vuelve y ella no era la misma Daysi por la que Gatsby una vez cayó hechizado, he allí el porque Gatsby durante la historia no está enamorado de Daysi, si no de la idea de Daysi.Pensando y haciendo una pequeña investigación, termine de comprender como está historia es una crítica al sueño americano y como estar atrapado en el pasado puede determinar la vida de cada uno de nosotros."
1378,Lavanya,"This book beautifully portrays the American dream , idealism and the pursuit of money and happiness. The cast of characters is intentionally shallow and the authors lets the readers to subjectively fill the gaps This is my take on themTom- the cliched rich guy with horses and cars and carrying spirited discussions about the racist eugenics philosophies .He likes his life not to be disturbed. He would do anything to get his way.Daisy-the frivolous shallow wife who just wants to be with a rich guy.Love is disposable for her and she is a caricature of the confused ladyNick- the narrator. He is that guy who wants to be rich and greatly admires Gatsby . It is like guy love or he could be gayGatsby- the rich neighbor.No one knows how he makes money. He is known for his fabulous parties. He seeks the perfect life with daisy . He made his money to marry Daisy. But she was already gone. He is a metaphor for the impossible dreamJordan- nick's date or beard. The golf pro who cheats to get her way. She doesn't like men who can see through her. Scott Fitzgerald's story is poetic and it stands the test of time. You can take today's America and place it in the fictious world of west and east egg. West egg is like silicon valley with the unfettered consumption and lavish parties thrown by newly minted millionaires. East egg is like new York's upper east side rich people with family money. Gatsby's pursuit of Daisy the green light is a nice metaphor for chasing the American Dream and losing sight of time .But how we still go for it. And we have to look to the past and learn from our ancestors.Some people's dreams may die . But it is the dream itself that keeps the society going. Such a statement that is valid even today.""Gatsby believed in the green light. The orgastic future that year by year recedes before us.It eluded us then, but that's no matter- tomorrow we will run faster , stretch out our arms further.. And one fine morning--so we beat on , boats against the current , borne back ceaselessly into the past.""The author shows us how the fabulous life is such a facade. You can compare any celebrity like Marilyn Monroe or the kardashians to Gatsby.How one can wield power with money and celebrity status. How it will all be gone as time goes by.The closest novel to this is probably pride and prejudice - my other favorite."
1379,Dana Al-Basha,"This book is artificially bittersweet; the conversations, the characters, the events, the parties, the love and pain of it all seems to have a dreamlike quality. I'm still not sure what I love so about this book. I just love it. I love the new movie adaption as well, which is so close to the actual book. The movie made me want to read the actual book so badly, to relive the whole roaring love story again."
1380,Brista Drake,"I can't remember much about this book when I read it in high school, but I've since memorized every outstanding quote that's ever been taken from it.This book, reading it a second time, has made the world that much sad and bewildering to me. I want to be Gatsby, not in the I-want-to-live-golden sense, but to believe anything is possible, ignorant of the possible sense of failure that makes a person tired and miserable for the rest of their life.But if anything, those quotes take the prize, for how settle they are, but ring so true to reality, no matter what century it is read in. F. Scott Fitzgerald for life. "
1381,Trillian,"This is a classic. I love the way F. Scott Fitzgerald captures Mr. Gatsby's life through the eyes of someone else. That's such a great way to write. It's unique to how most stories are written today, either in third or first person. Fitzgerald truly is a wonderful writer. In what is known as the roaring 20s, a man named Nick Carraway narrates the untold story of Mr. Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby is the mysterious man who lives in the mansion right next door to Nick's house. He throws extravagant parties, yet he lives alone. As Nick and Gatsby become friends, Nick starts to learn more about who this grand person is. What he finds out is that this great Mr. Gatsby and his lover Daisy might not actually be the people he thought they were. What happens when a perfect person turns out to be imperfect? Find out in The Great Gatsby. I read this book in school so I can tell you all about how this book represents the American Dream and give you a very detailed analysis how the green light at the end of Daisy's dock represents hope. I can tell you all of that and more. I don't think you want to know that. I think you want to know why I like The Great Gatsby. I loved the Great Gatsby because Gatsby is not this perfect person. You see that he is like everyone else deep down and you feel compassion for him. Reading this book made me see that no one is perfect, even the people you look up to the most. You can see beauty in the person even through their imperfections. Gatsby, Daisy, and Nick were all people I felt connected to at the end of the book. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Even if you had to read it for school and analyze every part of it. Read it. Love it. Live it. "
1382,Hillery,Loved re-reading this beautifully written book. Definitely worth a revisit. Timeless themes about class. 
1383,Dulce María,"Un libro escrito tan maravillosamente por F. Scott Fitzgerald que me hizo creer que estaba en los años 20´s.Una novela con una narrativa increíble, con una historia que habla sobre los sueños, los sueños no cumplidos, los sueños que se derrumban y cambian con el transcurso del tiempo. El libro es narrado por Nick el personaje mas honesto y neutral de todo el libro (aunque aveces esto me desespere ya que el lo sabe todo y no dice nada y si hubiese intervenido las cosas serian muy distintas) quien resulta ser el vecino de Gatsby un millonario que se dedica a dar las mejores fiestas del lugar del cual se hace amigo y acabara por ser el único en descubrir su historia y secretos más profundos, también es el primo de Daisy una muchacha que vive infeliz en un matrimonio en el cual sabe que su marido la engaña y como es una chica educada debe callarse y aguantar la trama va girando alrededor de estos personaje y de Tom el esposo de Daisy y Jordan una golfista amiga de estos últimos.Creo que el personaje de Gatsby nos enseña que el que haya muchas personas a tu alrededor no quiere decir que no estés solo.SPOILERS:El libro me pareció sumamente triste ya que todo lo que hizo Gatsby fue por tener el amor de Daisy, mientras que esta me pareció que obtuvo lo que merecía ya que prefirió la seguridad monetaria a luchar por el verdadero amor y si no lo amaba entonces ¿para que darle alas?, se que dentro de esa época era muy difícil para una mujer levantarse y luchar por sus ideales, pero me gusta creer que de haber sido yo lo habría hecho y me entristece de sobre manera el saber que Daisy no se atrevió a hacerlo"
1384,Kasia,"I dont really know why Im rating this book with 5 stars, but there is something about that book which doesnt let me rate it different."
1385,Nick Bremer,"“There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.”Where do I begin? What I find beautiful about this book is that it lays down no true foundation for you to feel justice and injustice. Every character is flawed and the reality is that there truly is no resolve, besides a realization that it's not necessarily all going to be okay. I love that. Many detest it because they don't see how it is the truth in life. Some would rather pretend they have just lives, and blame their detest on character disconnect or their hate of fame and fortune. The polarized reactions among people are expressions of the book by themselves, since we all either accept it, or deny and hate it, such as life. Another key theme I saw in this book is the truth about dreams. Throughout the book, Nick, Gatsby, and Daisy are on the pursuit of something, whether it be the bond business, or simply love. What stopped these dreams was wealth, want, greed, and power. I think what Fitzgerald was exploring with wealth and dreams working side by side is that we are approaching a world that no longer knows what it means to have a true dream. A world that knows parties, money, alcohol, lies, and illusions of grandeur. There is no longer a need to dream, you can pretend and lie your way to fame and fortune, and isn't that what everyone wants? With all this loss in mind, it is even more vital to remember what this book is saying; people are so much more than what they can buy, drink, or cheat. “Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope.” Nick knew that the lives he saw were broken, and life wasn't a matter of impressing your neighbor, or living to fulfill a forgotten dream. Nick knew life was always moving forward, whether we want to embrace that or not. ""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter—to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning——So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.” So, as life moves, and people and situations break or build up, the true foundation of our lives is to embrace it all, and remember the infinite hope. I would highly recommend this book because it has changed my view on life and I hope it will do the same for you. "
1386,Leniw,"I can understand why some people may not appreciate this book. People are usually attracted to quick and complicated story lines. This book has nothing to do with quick or complicated. First of all I loved the characters and the way Fitzgerald describes them. Although Fitzgerald never really describes in detail the physical appearance of the characters, you can see them and hear them clearly in your mind. Every character is realistic. Personally I could identify and connect each character with people that I've met.Fitzgerald uses the English language beautifully. The words he uses seem to be carefully chosen and his sentences wonderfully formed. I have a habit of underlining sentences that I like in a book and I underlined many from this one.Moreover, I believe that the book focuses a lot on the American dream. A poor young man who fells in love with a shallow rich girl. He loses her due to his caste and devotes his life to win her again by showing off how rich he has become. This book made me think a lot about about people that cannot see past their own noses, their shallowness and immaturity. As Fitzgerald states, [...]they smash up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness[...] and let other people clean up the mess they made... Very often the writer states every-day truths like that and he just makes your mind working on them.This book definitely deserves to be in the top of the american classics and I find it sad that people don't appreciate it."
1387,Karolyn Sherwood,"WHAT I THINK TODAY:So, it's certain I'll never be a politician; not that I ever wanted to be. Last summer, I read The Great Gatsby for the first time in my life; my earlier review is below. I'd seen the movie (I've seen just about every movie with Robert Redford in it.), but I'd never read the book. (In high school, my favorite teacher taught British Lit. Perhaps I should have branched out.) Upon further review, I shall eat crow whenever anyone reminds me of my earlier dubiousness concerning its greatness.My second reading of this classic truly opened my eyes. Instead of rushing through it so I could say I'd read it, this time I essentially read this line by glorious line. I underlined a hundred well-turned phrases. A few noteworthy examples: ""... high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life."" And ""... I like large parties. They're so intimate. At small parties there isn't any privacy."" More: ""he was... second cousin to the devil."" And lastly, ""The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.""A close second, in my opinion, to Fitzgerald's superior turn of a phrase is the sublime subtlety with which he lets the facts of the story unfold. Never too soon, never too obvious. Brilliant!F. Scott Fitzgerald's structure, foreshadowing, verbiage, setting, and plot remain stellar after nearly a hundred years of scrutiny as well. His remarkable ability to tell a story from the first POV of a character who is NOT the protagonist is nothing short of brilliant. Nick Carraway narrates the story—which some would argue makes him the protagonist, but he wants essentially nothing. A protagonist must want something. Gatsby wants Daisy, therefore he is the protagonist. He wants her as much as Frodo wants the ring. He simply cannot narrate his own story because he dies in the end. (I hope that wasn't a spoiler!) The Great Gatsby has become my all-time favorite novel... or at least it's now in my top five. WHAT I THOUGHT IN AUG. 2011:You know what I like about the 21st Century? The ability to say anything I want, and the platform from which to shout it. If The Great Gatsby were submitted to an agent today, as is, by a no name author, I wonder what the response would be. Don't get me wrong, I agree it's a great read, but what would an editor do with it? Is it just me, or could this prose use a little cleaning up? Ok, so in 1925, when it was written, perhaps the rules weren't as stringent (or were they more so?). The Elements of Style wasn't published until 1959—maybe now it would be edited differently. In any case, now that I'm analyzing literature (albeit from a non-editor's background), I'd make a few changes.What's important here, of course, is not the punctuation, etc., but the story. Yes, it's superb. But you already knew that.Five stars."
1388,Elisa,Genius. Best book I could've finished the year with.
1389,Alun,"A damning indictment of society at the level where it is all really a facade and nobody really knows or cares for the vast majority of the peoplethey socialise with. The Great Gatsby is one of the novels I do include in the must read before you depart this world list. It's slick and well written and although I cannot say for not having experienced the lifestyle and times, it captures a period and a section of society and then hangs them out to dry. As for Gatsby, I like Gatsby and I feel sorry for him even if he isn't what he purports to be, either.It's not a taxing read and the language works with the characters and places. Definitely one of the greats."
1390,Ioana Goganau,"I'm not gonna go into the jazz-era, American dream etc. The strongest and saddest thought I have after this book, is that love has a time and place. If you miss the moment it perishes away like a passing wind. Sometimes it is only in our heads and sometimes we can really love different people in different ways. And this book has it all, in a desperate tragical heart-breaking way.I find it fascinatingly romantic the way Gatsby wants Daisy. What woman would not like to inspire such devotion? There's also in the book, when they knew each other the first time: “He looked at her the way all women want to be looked at by a man.”But the idea of Gatsby, that he can just come back in Daisy's life as a new rich fascinating man, but in the same time the one that she loved years before, as if no time has passed, though romantic, it is somehow delusional. She did love him, but she also let go and she did love Tom afterward. One may think that if she really wanted Gatsby, she would have waited for him or accepted him even poor, and based on the fact that she was ready to escape to New York just to say goodbye to him before the family stopped her, or that she urged him to come back in her letters, makes me think she might have. Maybe it was lack of determination, fear for rejection because of being poor, combined with the miss-fortune of the war that stopped Gatsby to come back earlier. Maybe things would have been different. But he didn't come in time and time passed.Truth is, in real life people move on, it breaks their heart, but they move on and they can love again more or less. So in my opinion this is one heart-breaking realistic side of the story. Not all of us can devote their life to a love that they don't even know it's real. But how can you prove it's real anyway? I wish we could devote to love like this, because anyway nothing has a meaning unless you give it one. Gatsby takes it to one extreme where he believes blindly in the meaning of his love. Daisy on the other hand, finds out she can detach herself and move on. I find her affected and calculated, the very image of somebody who has lost some ideals and the passion for life. She has a cynical ""sophisticated"" attitude which makes it hard to picture her as the woman Gatsby fell for. On the side story Jordan and Nick casually decide to stop whatever they had in a very cool and calm way, which makes sense, but is mildly annoying. Because love is not supposed to make that much sense. But it also centers the idea that, if people are not there for you when you need support they might as well not be in your life at all. There's people to take to parties and there's people to share life stories with. But the question remains, can you take back the time? Can you fight against the current? Time passed, life moved on, people changed. I think the only person who did not change was Gatsby. Despite his fortune Gatsby stayed the same idealistic young man who believed he can make anything possible, even take back time. And it's an impressively created character, the image he creates of himself, who he really is, the way he chooses to reveal truths about himself, the love he put so much effort to attain. He had to try at least to take back the time, but what he found out (if he did realize it at all) was that Daisy changed and moved on. She had a memory of him and she might have still loved him in a way, but it was not enough. I don't entirely blame her either. She was a fortunate child of chance. She probably never loved ever with her full heart. At times Gatsby also seems a bit too infatuated and focused a bit on his ego. He wants not only for himself to know that she always loved him. He also want Tom and the world to know. But overall his tender gestures, some of them hidden, leaves the impression that he does really love her or at least the idea of her, in a gentle complete, selfless way that truly few people are capable of.Somehow, though sad, it was better the Gatsby did not live to see his life dream shuttered by the smallness of everyday life."
1391,Chungsoo Lee,"The author's surprising reference at the end to the Long Island (where Gatsby's beautiful mansion stood) as how it might have been first seen by the Puritans arriving to the New World comes as a surprise but is very pertinent as an ending. Gatzby, driven by his dream, fulfills it in the end at an enormous cost--only to have it splip away without any rewards or justification for the effort. A relentless pursuit of a dream: for what and at what cost? The Great Gatsby is a pertinent metaphor for the Great America, built by people with dreams: be they John Witherspoon's deam of a 'shining city upon on the hill,' which was repeated by Ronald Reagan, or the dream of a perfect union pursued by the founding fathers, or even the dreams of every immigrant who comes here. But for what and at what cost? The cries of the Native Indians and of the African slaves and the legacy of destruction that followed decades thereafter cannot be forgotten. A powerful writing by a master of poetry and story teller. Well read by Alexander Scourby. "
1392,Sam Angari," I would say that the book collectively is an elegant masterpiece! The 1922 Jazz-time America was where this short story took place. The writer successfully sent his messages through his book in a simple brilliant way. From the eyes of Carraway (The narrator), we stepped inside the rich world with all its false reputation and immorality that makes everybody, especially the poor lower-class, pay the price of the higher-class carelessness. The area of debate I assume is about the superficial characters but I’m pretty convinced that this world exists by all means and this fictional novel is not but a mirror to reality with its ending. I find it brilliant to picture the bi-directional emotions of infidelity from both sides and how all the deviations must get aligned at the end and wrong doings never go unpunished. On a bigger scale, I felt sorry for Fitzgerald that he died thinking he’s a failure after writing this book not knowing that it gained popularity right after his death and through the 2000s ! Is it, on a wider view, the great ones’ fate? To get a belated appreciation?! Maybe or maybe they are just the unfortunate group. It also reminds me of how our look to ourselves is pretty much a reflection to other people’s opinion on us and our fate in life is sometimes coupled with this view. I would sum it up with F. Scott Fitzgerald’s dream of this novel to be : ""something new—something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned."" A must-read!"
1393,Chiara Pagliochini,"« Una sera udii un’automobile vera, e vidi i fari fermarsi ai gradini d’ingresso. Non andai a informarmi. Probabilmente era un ultimo ospite che arrivava dall’altra estremità della terra e non sapeva che la festa era finita. »Gli ultimi invitati se ne vanno via alla spicciolata. Le signorine, avvolte in una nube mista di acqua di rose e tabacco, camminano sbilenche sulle scarpe col tacco. Gli uomini porgono il braccio, stra-ridono. Le bocche si spanciano in risate grossolane, la fine di un’ubriacatura. Il viale, mozziconi di sigaro, cannucce, bicchieri mezzi vuoti sui gradini della fontana, sarà spazzato domattina. La ramazza ammucchierà in un angolo lo scarto della festa. Il padrone di casa carezzerà la sua sbornia tra lenzuola sudate. Così, quando finisce un romanzo di Fitzgerald, ecco che si scoperchia la patina brilluccicosa, odorosa di una festa. Ecco che emergono i volti sudati sotto la cipria che cola. Quel che è stato bello si sciupa. Quello che è stato dolcissimo si involgarisce. Questo, questo è l’unico sottotesto possibile di ogni paragrafo, inciso, virgola di Francis Scott Fitzgerald, vero per il Grande Gatsby più che mai: il canto del cigno della giovinezza spensierata, dell’orgoglioso sogno americano, la passione per una vita vissuta forse con troppa pienezza e per questo presto bruciata, consumata come una candela che sia arsa in un incendio, l’amore per donne bellissime, dolorosamente, fascinosamente, necessariamente superficiali (o lievi, forse, più lievi come barche a vela). Finisce la festa. Si accendono, nella notte, i fari delle auto. Muore l’illusione di una felicità pervicacemente inseguita. Resta, sulla punta della lingua, l'amaro di averci provato. "
1394,Kristina Lowen,"Fitzgerald's purpose in The Great Gasby was indirectly identified through the life of Jay Gatsby. Gatsby represented the idea of this American Dream, the honky-dory allusion that ""anyone can achieve anything if they try"". However, this proves to be untrue considering Gatsby has to acquire his status rank and wealth through shady measures. Fitzgerald purpose was that, through Gatsby, to show the flaw of this idea, that maybe the American Dream isn't all about the money and surface friendships, but true relationships, which Gatsby lacked and therefore was empty. First, the defining theme in The Great Gatsby was the magnetic pull of the past. Throughout the novel, it is reemphasized again and again how crucial acceptance of the past is. This is shown by Gatsby, who cannot recognize this being his demon, and is clear to the reader yet invisible to himself. Indirectly leading to his own death, the effect of this simple concept was tragic. Using this, Fitzgerald attempted to prove where you're from does not define your future. Tying in with the American Dream concept, Gatsby couldn't accept a life as a farm boy and was ashamed by that upbringing (that past), so he stretched himself to be an illusional ""self"", one he eventually proved he could not be. Also, he could not accept an end point to his relationship with Daisy, therefore driving himself mad with regret and second questioning. This is tragic, and the reader must watch as they see Gatsby destroy himself. Continued, Fitzgerald's style is easily definable as narration. The story unfolds through the eyes of Nick, and only through him do we see Gatbsy's past unfold. However, though the book is written chronologically, it is constantly interrupted by flashbacks that usually lead to a better understanding of Gatsby's past and an idea of his future. But, the way it is written still flows with storyline style, and adds to the book as a whole. In conclusion, I personally adored this book. It's become one of my all-time favorites. The story unfolds perfectly and your heart breaks for Gatsby. I grew sentimental about his character, and only wish that he learned from his past instead of dwelling on it, which turned out to be his downfall. The only thing I disliked was the beginning of the closing chapter. It describes reporters and journalists interested in Gatsby's death, which confused me, because previously in the chapter's showing his funeral, Fitzgerald made it seem empty and that no one really cared. It was an awkward 180 degree shift that sort of left me puzzled. However, I wouldn't change anything about the way Fitzgerald wrote it because he wrote with an air of ease. It's individuality in plot and my emotional attachment to the storyline made it a book that I won't soon forget."
1395,Susan Anderson,Read this in college many years ago. Absolutely fabulous read
1396,Kimberly,"I really loved this book. I think my enthusiasm was reduced somewhat by the school assignments that came with it, but I still LOVED it. I think my favorite part is when Nick calls Tom and Daisy careless- I could go look up the quote right now, but I really don't feel like it and I don't want to get any of the words wrong, so if you've read the book, you know what I'm talking about, and if you haven't, GO READ IT."
1397,Claire E.," All Jay Gatsby, a rich and longing man, wants is the past. He would give anything to repeat what he once had and her name is Daisy Buchanan. In fact he throws flashy parties each Saturday night with hundreds of people, but doesn’t associate with anyone there. Gatsby only wishes that Daisy would see his house lit up across the bay and fall in love with him once again. The only problem that stands in his way is that Daisy is now a married woman. Coincidentally, Daisy’s cousin, Nick Carraway, rented out the small house beside Jay Gatsby’s mansion. After Gatsby took the chance to get to know his neighbor better, he asked a large request of Nick. Chaos of battling love stories begin. Set in the time period of the roaring twenties, The Great Gatsby written by F. Scott Fitzgerald tells the depths Gatsby will go to receive his lost love. Throughout this unique story, there will be confusion in who to trust and you will be questioning the roles of characters. As soon as you think you know what will happen, you’re wrong. What made this book particularly interesting was the way you connect to the book. It’s beautiful on literary terms and something about the way it’s written makes you feel as if you were a part of it all. The perspective is in Nick Carraway’s eyes and he watches as everything unfolds before him. Within this novel, he mentions a lot of characters and it can get confusing. Nonetheless, from beginning to end you’re hooked! Before you know it, tears are falling into the book because it’s over. Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed how Fitzgerald made everything in the novel seem so important in the sense of many metaphors and poetic language. His writing made the novel that much more appealing. I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves romantic complications, so most likely any female out there. Also, recall that it’s set back in the 1920’s, hence anyone who loves reading about that time period would enjoy this book as well. Once you have read this book, don’t forget to watch the movie immediately afterwards. Seeing the book has so many details, the film does not include all of it, but it definitely does it great justice. "
1398,Kasper,"""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne ceaselessly into the past."" Now, that's one hell of a final line. What strikes me most about this novel is that not one word seems out of place. Every chapter, every event, every character has a purpose. I find it sort of strangely perfect - more so than ""best novel of all-time"" great. But 'The Great Gatsby' remains an enduring classic for a reason. "
1399,Sara Farinha,"E se não fosses capaz de enterrar o passado? E se todas as tuas acções e planos se destinassem a fazer evaporar o tempo que passara? E se recuperar um amor perdido fosse o motivo por trás de todas as tuas decisões?Jay Gatsby é o homem que todos queriam ser e que todas as mulheres não se importariam de ter. O dinheiro, a casa, as festas, os automóveis, barcos e aviões, tudo fazia parte da vida do misterioso Gatsby que, vivendo uma vida incomum, evitava os constrangimentos normais da época. Nada parecia cativá-lo o suficiente para se tornar como todos os outros. E, como tudo o que não encaixa na definição dos outros de ‘normal’, provoca a curiosidade e malícia, eles decidiam de que cor pintar o seu passado, enquanto aproveitavam a hospitalidade do presente.Nick Carraway é o primeiro a ver Gatsby tal como ele é. Peça fundamental na concretização das intenções de Gatsby, vê-se no papel de confidente deste estranho homem, tornando-se na testemunha do seu passado e no veículo da mensagem desta história. Num universo americano do pós-guerra onde o dinheiro, o glamour e as festas ditam os costumes sociais, ‘The Great Gatsby’ é na essência uma história de um amor perdido, de pessoas levianas e inconsequentes, de relações ilícitas com finais trágicos. É a confirmação de que algo perdido no passado, dificilmente pode ser recuperado. Mas, também, que esse algo nunca pode ser ignorado sem ter sido definitivamente enfrentado, sob pena de tristes fins.Num cruzamento de histórias e destinos é um livro que nos marca pelas descrições de época, mas também pela profundidade emocional de um homem, uma certa ingenuidade, que se revela por trás da máscara composta com que vive. Um Clássico que tanto tem de actual nos vislumbres que nos proporciona da natureza humana, na ingenuidade das grandes paixões, na frivolidade das relações, nas consequências de actos irreflectidos, no egoísmo da auto-preservação pessoal e, acima de tudo, nas ilusões das quais os homens se alimentam para sobreviver.http://sarinhafarinha.wordpress.com/2..."
1400,Zach Franz,"An excellent book. I, like many, read this in high school and didn't understand all the layers. I probably still don't, but got much more out of it the second time around. Strong philosophical points; crisp, biting prose; effective brevity. This is a big book for how short it is."
1401,Malinda,"Reading this book two, three, four times at intervals of life never diminishes its value as like Nick, I am born into the dream. I find myself aching with recognition over the tremulous words that invigorate Gatsby's beautiful creations and belief in the green light like a potent fever that changes a being forever. The reaching for the ultimate. Ultimate. Even when no one else sees or believes in the ultimate. So Gatsby is one of those rare and ultimate novels. So many parallels to familiarities we find along the sinister road of life, the large, prolonged, insatiable party of living. Daisy's, Jordan's, Tom's, Wilson's, and even Myrtle's are people we navigate all the time. But when and where do we fall upon the rarity to encounter a Gatsby. You know when you do, because suddenly, you believe anything is possible in a way you never did before. And when they go into the past, they take your new, adopted foundation with them. Fitzgerald is sweeping, and his words leave a haunting melody that one will never hear again but were privileged to hear at all. "
1402,Allyson,"A classic, through and through. Why didn't I read this sooner?!"
1403,lia,"what hasn't been said about The Great Gatsby? Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And then one fine morning—it is about dreaming the impossible dream. To reach out so close, to give it all out, yet tragically learns that it is a false dream, a false hope. I think the beauty of this book is on the obsession of a man who literally invented himself, who moved heaven and earth to posses something that he actually already left behind. "
1404,Amulya Malladi,I never really understood the book when I read it as a teenager. But now as an adult I was moved and enthralled. This is the great American novel. At the end as Nick looks for someone to come for Gatsby's funeral I felt the agony and the loss of Gatsby's greatness - and the demise of his innocent love along with him. What a beautiful book. The classics are classics for a reason.
1405,Hannah,"I didn't quite know what to expect when I started reading this book. On the one hand, it is a classic, so it must be good on some level, right? Then there's the movie that just came out, which seemed to be viewed as a failure on the whole. I didn't know how reliable readers who were inspired to read just because of the movie were. But I found myself enjoying it and finished it within a day. The story is there, a great and dramatic tragedy with a slightly understated voice that reflects well the mindset of the period as interpreted by Fitzgerald. That life was about luxury, making yourself, and achieving those things using whatever methods necessary. I thought Nick was the wisest character in the book. He surrounds himself with these rich and careless people, and while he gains their trust and friendship, ultimately, he doesn't lose his head like they do. The writing was ethereal, and had a dreamlike quality that was visionary and metaphorical. At times I would read my way through a page and only discover what I had just been reading after I had finished. The imagery blurred with reality a lot, when Nick was describing things and places and people. It was confusing at times, but effective. Gatsby and his story came together piece by piece and a large part of the suspense that held me to reading it was finding out who exactly Jay Gatsby is. For me at least it's hard to nail down a specific message or moral Fitzgerald was trying to communicate. There seems to be a lot. Perhaps that wealth and status aren't always equal to power when it comes to desires that go against the will of another. That man cannot be all powerful, not a god. A look at the complexity of relationships, or even man itself. For me, finding out who Gatsby apparently really was was almost anticlimatic in some ways. I had high hopes for him, and so did Nick, who, despite all his shortcomings, admired Gatsby as a friend and the most ardent believer in ""the green light"" he ever knew. Altogether a very well written book and a good story too. "
1406,Anisha,"	The Great Gatsby is a fantastic book written by a magnificent author, F. Scott Fitzgerald. Set in the Jazz Age, this book tells a story of a group of young, wealthy New Yorkers engulfed in multiple love triangles. Fitzgerald does a wonderful job describing and drawing out the characters as he keeps the reader engaged in the never-boring plot of the story. Although an advanced read with a moderate level of confusion at times, The Great Gatsby is a compelling, thought-provoking piece of literature. 	Capturing one of the novels main themes, “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past,” this quote embodies the idea of not being able to recreate the past, no matter how hard we try (page 180). The novel is centered on Jay Gatsby and his five year pursuit for his past lover, Daisy’s, current affection. Amidst fancy parties, high wealth, and gossip central, Gatsby’s life was still an empty one without Daisy. Tom, Daisy’s husband, Nick, Daisy’s cousin, and Jordan are all also big characters with big roles. The way that Fitzgerald illustrates each of them pulls the reader in even more. The Great Gatsby is a skillfully crafted work of art that portrays American life in the late 1920s in such a way that the reader simply cannot put the book down. The detailed insight of the greed-driven, unfulfilled lives of the wealthy during this era is intricately woven into an evocative plot containing a not so typical love triangle. Personally, I give it a 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend this wonderful piece of famous literature. "
1407,Lucia," “I hope she'll be a fool -- that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.”  5/5 stars. I swear, this book made me want to throw myself against a wall. Mind you, that is not a good thing.  The Great Gatsby  is one of F. Scott Fitzgerald's famous works and I frankly understand why. It's messed up but yet, it makes sense. I often find that dreams should always be pursued but sometimes, like in the book, the Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Jay Gatsby had chased an unworthy dream by recreating a world where his ex-Daisy Buchanan live in with her husband, Tom Buchanan and had always had this dream of reuniting with her again. But in reality, Daisy’s manipulative and shallow because she had blamed Gatsby for the things she had done. As a result, Gatsby had died. He had died because the tragedy in the book isn’t dreaming, it’s in chasing a dream that would never exist and couldn’t possibly work. Even though so much hard work like Gatsby. The American Dream is a dream and that’s that. There are some errors and faults in each character's thoughts. Like Daisy, she only aims for money and she is the youth of some women in the world. She only wants diamonds and rich. For Gatsby, it's his dream; the merciless American dream which pursues him to fight back and change his life for the 'better.' Overall, the Great Gatsby is one of my favorites and it will always will be. "
1408,Kim,"A re-read for one of my classes proved my theory, which is that this book is just as complex and tragic and nuanced as I remember. Daisy is still careless, Gatsby is still hopeless, and Nick is still confused, but after our 3-hour discussion in class I've got a bigger picture of the many sides to Fitzgerald's cast. And the ending. Oh, man. I only have to read the final section of the last chapter to remind myself why I love this craft of literature."
1409,Hannah Axtelle,"The Great Gatsby is one of my favorite books of all time. This book is written with such beautiful language and portrays realistic issues that have to deal with love, loss, greed, and aspirations. I love how the story in this book develops. I love that Gatsby is almost the main character but the story is told by a slightly neutral character. I love the character of Gatsby and how he seems like such a superficial man but he is truly a man who knows what he wants and won't give up on it even if it threatens his life. Gatsby is a man who lives on the edge but still contains class and manners. This story that contains the details of his life can be interpreted in many ways but always allows the reader to make their conclusions about why this book was written. I love how the book makes you think and takes you on a journey that is timeless even though this book is now a time piece. This book is a classic and will continue to be so because it is such a good novel that gets the reader thinking. The language could be a great tool to teach high school age students about how to use language correctly and in a way that makes the story better. I will always recommend this book to anyone who needs a good read. "
1410,Stuart Ayris,"Reading The Great Gatsby I feel I have taken a step forward in many ways. It is not a long novel and not really much happens. You don't really get to know too much about the main characters nor really get to have a fondness for any of them. Despite all that, and perhaps in part because of it, I found the book to be wonderful.Nick Carraway narrates the events of the summer of 1922 during which he meets Jay Gatsby and participates to a degree in the story that unfolds. The subtlety of the novel is its heartbeat. Each line is so well crafted, just tempting you to see what is implied as well as what is written. If I were to use one adjective to describe it then that word would be 'sparkle'. It is a hard, uncompromising tale of rich people falling apart, the story of people who can overcome anything so long as material possessions abound - even taking the life of another or being married to someone you don't love.Inbetween all the perfect descriptions and genteel mannerisms of the main characters there are outbursts of violence that really do make you gasp. Tom Buchanan, a brute of a man, takes Nick with him to an apartment in New York where Tom has his away days with his mistress. Another couple are invited and a drunken party ensues. Then Tom's mistress begins taunting him about his wife and...""Making a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his open hand.""Literally stunning.The novel seems to me to be an allegory of the capitalist dream, that constant pursuit of some definable attainment that tells everybody else you have 'made it.' Gatsby, on the surface, has made it. He has an amazing house and throws lavish parties for complete strangers yet the foundations are built on lies and deceit. Even the love he has for Tom Buchanan's wife is as superficial as he believes it deep.The tragedy that befalls Gatsby at the end almost feels superficial to the real tragedy that F.Scott Fitzgerald has laid before us - that it is not just Gatsby and the Buchanans who ruin the lives of others, it is the very ethos behind their acts that continues to this day; the pursuit of power and love by means of wealth.Needless to say, the book fair blew me away."
1411,Shahla,"

No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.

This book is hailed as a masterpiece, and rightly so. Because my god, the way this book is written reveals such thorough craftsmanship and meticulous attention.I'm not one of those people who drool over classics just because their classics and distance myself from *sniff* contemporaries of today. I actually don't like reading classics. At all. The only other one I like is Pride and Prejudice - and come on, that book has freaking Mr. Darcy, so of course I'd love it. But The Great Gatsby is truly a magical novel, and also the first novel I have ever annotated. The people who hate this book may be too enraptured in the plot and the actual storyline. The thing is, you have to read this book with care to the language.  There's so much social commentary woven throughout it, accompanying the hollow-eyed residents of the ashheaps and the superficial residents of the Eggs. It remarks upon the laughable thought of attaining the American dream: the green light in the distance, the boat which fights against the currents to escape the past. The endless cycle of wealth born to wealth, and gathering more by the minute, and the poor struggling at the gas pumps and garages as poor Myrtle and Wilson.Or the commentary about women (this is, by the way, one of my favorite quotes of all time):

I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.

With this one sentence, Fitzgerald reveals a society in which women are expected to look pretty; to charm, to entice, and to have nothing worth of substance in regards to intellect and character. Daisy herself is immediately more interesting: she is often hated because of how utterly shallow she is, but what if this is a defense mechanism? A way of survival in a materialistic world? She plays the fool since that is the only good thing to do as a girl. The true tragic tale for me isn't Gatsby's, but Daisy's, a girl who grew up in a stringent meaningless high society, who loved only to have that love ripped away from her and replaced with a man who is brutish and unfaithful. Fitzgerald created her as the embodiment of the golden girl trope, yet she is so much more as well.And of course, the absolute beauty of the language shines through in practically every page with the sometimes breathtaking descriptions Fitzgerald composes. I mean...

Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.

The only other writer that comes close to crafting such sentences that I've read is Shakespeare. I can't imagine how difficult it was to write a novel laden with this much symbolism and depth. The Great Gatsby is short enough to hold the fleeting attention of Americans, and written impeccably enough to become immortalized as a classic. I absolutely loved it."
1412,Ashley Curcuru,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is one of the most magical books in American literature. I wanted to read this because I had always heard the name but never knew what the story was about. It is an interesting story told with extraordinary language. Nick Carraway narrates the story of Jay Gatsby and everything that his way of life meant. It is a fantastic story about love, loss, and the American Dream. I would recommend this book to anyone who appreciates the Jazz Age and the culture that surrounded it."
1413,Fil Garrison,"At the behest of both my girlfriend and my friend Jack, I decided to speed read this before I was to go to a Gatsby-themed dance party in Los Angeles. Up until then, I hadn't seen any of the movies, didn't really know what it was about, and never read it in high school.This is one book that I think I would have really enjoyed in high school, if I'm being honest. I'm not sure I would have appreciated it as much as I do now, but there's something about the actual wordplay and writing that I think I would have found extremely enjoyable. So many of the older ""classic"" novels have a weird and hard to read style, but this flowed into my head like a stream, very simple, enjoyable, and poetic.The story I won't waste too much time describing: a man moves in next to the eccentric recluse Gatsby, who is known to throw huge and elaborate parties for an unknown reason. Through happenstance, Nick, the main character, narrating in first person, becomes involved in a love story that goes back five years with his cousin, her husband, and Gatsby.The thing that really struck me about this story was its description of the 1920s lifestyle. Nick is so outside it all, always watching and thinking and reflecting on the waste or pageantry or style of it all, condemning it while still partaking and realizing its value and worth. Nick, for the majority of the story keeps his opinions to himself, confiding only in the reader for his ruminations, but ultimately, we see a beautifully painted view of the 1920s party scene and upper class society. We see the dark underbelly in Tom and his mistress, we see the frivolity and waste in his mistress' girlfriends, even a fair amount of this in Daisy, the object of Gatsby's desires.When introduced to Gatsby finally, we see a tender and even somewhat naive young man, full of love and jitters and nerves, a beautiful rendering of a love struck human being, someone who is almost too nice to exist. Of course, hiding behind this are the means by which he gained his fortune, but ultimately it doesn't matter, as his intentions are always in the right place, and his goal is a sound one. And it is here that the problem lies.Gatsby almost doesn't live in the real world, he has a fantasy of what his life with Daisy should look like, what it will be, jealousy takes over, and his love, boundless, begins to unravel him. It's tragic to watch such a man become undone, publicly, and through even more horrible circumstances, he loses even more than that.Ultimately, it is the last chapter which really made me go from liking this book to loving it. A long, horrible, and painful description of a funeral in which no one shows up, no one cares, friends abandon and business acquaintances disappear. A house is left in ghastly disarray, and the memory of wild parties and high society is revealed as the hollow shell it is. Nick is left with memories of a summer of parties, heartbreak, and loss. It's one of the most somber and sobering endings I've ever seen. It's made even more potent by the contrasting first 3/4 of the book in which life is lived gaily and with disregard, frivolity and waste.I'd recommend this to everyone. It's a classic, and the novel is an amazing rumination on class, love, society, and loss."
1414,Paola E. Haiat,"Al principio el libro no me parecía tan fascinante como me pareció al final, sobre todo al llegar a las últimas líneas que me dejaron entre anonadada y ebria de melancolía.Gatsby con sus ganas de revivir el pasado, Buchannan como un hombre que cree en la familia y con una doble moral enorme, y nuestro narrador, Nick, que nos llevará a lugares y situaciones en los que nunca soñamos con estar. Daisy, te odio con todo mi corazón.Personajes llenos de vanidad, de lujo, de ocio, de moralidad dudosa; pero aun así, personajes asombrosos y construidos con una pluma maravillosa.He llorado de forma en la que no pensé que pudiera con una historia que consideraba ""una más"".Me ha fascinado."
1415,Martina,"Difficile descrivere questo libro.Difficile parlarne, discuterne e comprendere il suo più profondo significato.Ci troviamo improvvisamente nei primi anni 20 del '900, in una New York in cui è ancora possibile realizzare 'il sogno americano', e proprio qui, ci accorgiamo di essere di fronte al più accanito sostenitore di tale desiderio, davanti a colui che, soggiogato dall'implacabile e tormentosa ambizione di ricchezza, dalla voglia di riscattarsi e di cancellare il suo misero passato, riesce a concretizzare le sue fantasie. Jay Gatsby, questo è il suo nome ma lo chiamano il Grande, il Grande Gatsby. I newyorkesi di lui sanno poco e nulla, non conoscono nemmeno la sua identità e tanto meno la sua storia, ma sono presenti a tutte le sfarzose feste che organizza, davvero grandiose queste ultime. Per cui il giovane Nick Carraway, voce narrante del romanzo e vicino di casa di Gatsby, sapeva meno dei newyorkesi stessi, fino a che un giorno riceve un invito per una di queste feste, l'unico forse in tutta New York ad averne uno.Ed è proprio nell'attimo stesso in cui i due si incontrano si intuisce quanto siano intrecciate le loro storie ed i loro destini.Nick riesce a scoprire chi è quest'uomo e Fitzgerald glielo fa descrivere e raccontare.Gatsby è la più bella delle illusioni, un uomo costruito ad arte, una luce artificiale creata per attirare falene, precisamente una falena, Daisy, la sua amata che abita proprio nell'isolotto di fronte a casa sua. Ma Gatby è un'anima fine e ha un dono, è ancora capace di sperare. Sogna fino all'ultimo secondo della sua esistenza, crede in un futuro migliore ed è disposto ad attendere e a lavorare sempre di più pur di ottenere la sua felicità.Gatsby è quindi la personificazione dei desideri degli americani ed il ritratto di un'America in cui a nessuno importava di nessuno.Fitzgerald ci mostra e delinea la generazione elitaria e menefreghista di quel tempo, riportando solo l'eccezione incarnata da Gatsby, colui non rinuncerà mai a ogni suo progetto."
1416,Hannah Meents,"The Great Gastby is a 1925 fictional story, written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, of eccentric millionaire Jay Gatsby as told by Nick Carraway, a Midwesterner who lives on Long Island but works in Manhattan. Gatsby’s enormous mansion is adjacent to Carraway’s modest home, and Carraway becomes curious about his neighbor after being invited to one of his famous parties. Nick soon learns that Gatsby is in love Daisy Buchanan, Nick’s cousin and the wife of Tom Buchanan, an acquaintance of Nick’s from Yale. Buchanan takes his old friend for a day in the city, where Nick learns that Buchanan has a kept woman, Myrtle, the wife of a long island mechanic.  Gatsby sends a message through he and Nick’s mutual friend, professional golfer Jordan Baker, insisting that Nick plan a “chance” meeting for Gatsby and Daisy. Nick learns that Gatsby, Jay Gatz at the time, and Daisy had once been in love. Nick manages to get Gatsby and Daisy together, and while the meeting is awkward at first, Gatsby soon relaxes and invites Nick and Daisy back to his mansion. Gatsby and Daisy begin to see each other secretly with some frequency. As the action begins to rise, and certain secrets are unvealed, along with various murders committed, you will have trouble putting this book down. Some of the wording and vocab in this book can be difficult at time, so I recommend it to whoever is up for the challenge, mainly those that fall in a high school reading level.  One of my favorite parts of the book is when Daisy and Gatsby meet again for the first time in so many years. I really enjoyed Gatsby's character, especially his brilliance, mysteriousness and use of the phrase ""old sport"". I don't like Tom Buchanan's character, especially because he sleeps around, which makes me inclined to wish Gatsby and Daisy together again. Another favorite part of mine is trying to figure out and learning about Gatsby's past life. How he acquired all of his money, why he changed his name, if he really was an Oxford man and was in the war, etc.  I learned quite a bit from this book, and it especially opened up my knowledge of life in this time period, especially for the more fortunate population in New York. The stocks were on the rise, prohibition was over and the drinks were cheaper as well as the parties being greater. The parties Gatsby threw were extravagant, with almost all of the Long Island upper class in attendance.  Overall, I think this was a very good book. The characters were very well developed, the plot was confusing at times but also kept it interesting and offered an enriching historical context for myself. WC: 459"
1417,Giuseppe,"Sicuramente uno dei più bei libri che ho letto, e riletto. La prima volta non mi aveva impressionato un granché, forse perché l'ho letto a spezzoni cercando azione e movimento nella trama. Non si tratta di romanzo che crea suspence con un intreccio complesso spingendoti fino all'ultima pagina. Se però si inizia ad apprezzare la splendida prosa e la caratterizzazione dei personaggi, ci si innamora di questo capolavoro e si è spinti comunque verso la fine. Non voglio parlare della trama, ma ci tengo a sottolineare la grandezza dei personaggi, Gatsby in primis: incarnazione di un sogno.Forse l'essenza del libro è proprio la contrapposizione tra la grandezza e la pochezza d'animo, non vi dico chi rappresenta cosa per non svelare nulla. Romanzo consigliatissimo, addirittura essenziale, buona lettura! "
1418,Melissa Klug,Had to get ready for the movie and reread! Worth it. 
1419,Holly *Confessions of a Lit Chick*,"This is my all time favourite novel... Every time I read it, I fall in love with Jay Gatsby. He's enigmatic, cool and collected, he's everything that makes this novel. I wish he'd ditch his fascination with Daisy and come find ME! haha :P My favourite quotes: “In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars.”  - I want this on my bedroom wall... It sounds so enchanting, captivating and hypnotic - I wish I could pull myself into this story and live it.“I hope she'll be a fool -- that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.” - Daisy.“Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead.” - Meyer Wolfsheim“I was within and without. Simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.” - Nick“No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.” In fact, maybe I should stop quoting, you'll probably end up with the whole novella on here! 
CHEERS!
"
1420,Shawn (ThatOneEnglishGradStudent),"The last time I read this novel, I was about fifteen years old, and I loved it then. I appreciate it so much more this time around. Nothing really to say except this book is awesome--a candidate for ""Great American Novel,"" in my opinion--and everyone should read it."
1421,Kate Zaborowski,"The Great Gatsby is a story that is narrated by Nick who is Daisy’s cousin from chicago who is a writer but wants to be in the bond business. Nick lives in a small cottage in the middle of giant mansions and across from his cousin Daisy’s mansion. When Nick originally goes to Daisys house he meets Jordan and she says you live next to Gatsby oh you must know Gatsby. Gatsby always threw extravagant parties always hoping Daisy would come but the only one ever invited was nick. Gatsby and Daisy had a past but when Gatsby went off to war he had to technically end it with Daisy. Then when Daisy moved on Gatsby basically said okay I’m ready for you to come back to me now but she was already married to Tom who’s having an affair on her with myrtle. The whole book is basically a twisted love story with tom and Myrtle, Myrtle and Wilson, Daisy and Tom, Daisy and Gatsby, and Nick and Jordan. What will happen with the love fest? Will Gatsby and Daisy get married? Is it true love? To read this book I suggest you are about of teenage years to adult hood. The book could be a hard read for some, it won’t keep you interested at first but when it starts picking up you’ll love it. I think everyone should read this book at least once in their life time. When you’re ready to read it you have to commit to reading it or you won’t finish it. I thought it was interesting, but some people might not. It’s got just about everything in it. The romance aspect is just super confusing but will keep you interested within itself. I think to be interested in this book you have to like suspense and drama. I think both men and women could read this because it could be seen as interesting to both parties. Like I said everyone should read it at least once. I’m giving The Great Gatsby 5 out of 5 stars due to the fact I found it interesting, even though it starts out slow and isn’t very interesting, when it starts picking up you won’t be able to set it down. I know I wasn’t able to. This book is such a well known text for a reason because it is so great. I loved reading about Gatsbys parties sometimes I would pretend I was attending them. The way Gatsby treats Daisy is amazing and by the end of the book Daisy was the worst! She was selfish and rude. You learn to tolerate but not respect Tom. Nick and Gatsby are the only Genuine characters in the book, such a good book."
1422,Fanda Kutubuku,"Sebuah kisah klasik yang bersetting tahun 1922, setelah Perang Dunia I berakhir. Perekonomian Amerika mulai tumbuh, dan banyak orang kaya baru muncul. Jay Gatsby termasuk di anataranya, ia adalah perwira miskin saat perang, terlalu miskin untuk dapat memenangkan hati seorang gadis yang ia cintai: Daisy. Maka setelah perang, ia bertekad mencari jalan menuju kekayaan. Ia berhasil 5 tahun kemudian, dan dengan bantuan Nick Carraway--tetangganya, berusaha mendekati Daisy, yang kini sudah menjadi Mrs. Buchanan.Kisah ini diceritakan dari sudut pandang Nick sebagai narator. Kita diajak Fitzgerald meneropong kehidupan dan moral para OKB ini. Awalnya nampak seolah Gatsby adalah tokoh antagonis yang misterius dan caranya mendapat kekayaan dipandang sinis oleh orang-orang di sekitarnya, meski mereka tetap antusias menghadiri pesta yang diadakan Gatsby. Hingga suatu hari terjadilah sebuah kecelakaan--yang meski menimpa orang lain--namun segera membuka mata Nick akan kepribadian mereka semua yang sesungguhnya. Di sinilah kita akan tahu mengapa ada kata ""Great"" dalam The Great Gatsby."
1423,Longfellow,"This is my fourth time reading The Great Gatsby. I've read two other Fitzgerald novels--This Side of Paradise and the unfinished The Last Tycoon--and they both seem like crap to me compared to this one.The pleasure of reading Gatsby is at least two-fold: the story is captivating, almost voyeuristic, and moves with a smooth intensity, but an equal pleasure is in discovering so many gorgeous sentences, one after another, gorgeous for their lyricism, their flow and rhythm, and for their profound density. As a reader I've had no other experience which compares. How a book can be as generally dark and pessimistic as this one and still be enjoyable and lovely, I don't know, but here is an example from the opening pages:""Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it was what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men."" This concludes, in my estimation, one of the best fictional paragraphs in American literature, and it is one sentence of many that leave me muttering in awe at Fitzgerald's giftedness. On this reading I noticed how much foreshadowing is packed into the initial description of characters, particularly Tom, who is predicted to ""drift on forever seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game,"" and Daisy, whose ""murmur was only to make people lean toward her.""Then there is Fitzgerald's articulate communication of disillusionment--if not with the whole human race in general, at least with that particularly privileged, uber-wealthy upper crust of the 1920s who, as a whole, are indicted through Tom and Daisy as ""careless people [...] they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness [...] and let other people clean up the mess they had made."" And ninety years later, we don't have to overtax our imagination to conceive this kind of behavior, particularly as corporations elude the consequences for irresponsible decision-making again and again.I fully expect a fifth reading, whenever it shall occur, will reveal even more reasons for delight."
1424,Anne-Marie,"Ohhhhhhhh my goshhhhh this book is AMAZING! Definitely on my top ten list of books EVER. It's so full of symbolism and believable characters and ahhhhhhh!! Seriously I'm kind of freaking out right now. SO good.This was one of those books where I just went, ""So true, so true,"" after nearly every sentence. I started out having no idea what I was about to read - and at first, I thought the book was rather boring until the story picked up a couple chapters in. Now I understand why F. Scott Fitzgerald kept saying ""old sport"" in Woody Allen's movie Midnight in Paris. So sad, but so coolish!I honestly don't even know what to say really... so yeah. Allow me to have my nerdy freak-out in peace. Is there a hyphen in ""freak-out?"" I don't know but for obvious reasons I am rather fond of the hyphen so I rule that it stays. K bye.Waaaait I have another point. WHO gave Leonardo DiCaprio the role of Gatsby in the Great Gatsby movie coming out? I guess I should give it the benefit of the doubt but I would just never picture Leo as Gatsby. It doesn't seem right. (Yes, Leo and I are on a first-name basis. There I go again using a hyphen. You might think it's cool, but it seriously gets annoying because he calls me all the time at odd hours of the night.)"
1425,Mike Ingram,"If you haven't read this book since being forced to read it in high school, you really should. Amazing. (unlike Catcher in the Rye: I guarantee your high school memories have preserved a better version of that book than the one which actually exists)"
1426,Vinod Peris,"I was looking for some light reading, both in terms of content as well as the weight of the book, for I wanted to finish this in a few days before I embarked on a vacation where a few long plane rides would enable me to read longer and denser material without distraction. This book fit the bill perfectly and was readily available at my local library so I made a quick trip to the Los Altos Woodland Library and picked up a copy.I had recently read Hemingway's ""The Sun also Rises"" and the more recent retelling of his life in Paris with first wife Hadley Richardson in Paul McLain's ""The Paris Wife: A Novel"". The latter described the bohemian lifestyle of the many American literary expats in Paris and Scott Fitzgerald was one of the prominent ones. So not only did I start this book with high expectations, since it is one of the all-time American Classics, but I also had a view of the colorful life of the author Scott Fitzgerald at the time of the writing of this book and so was expecting some inspired writing.As is often the case, the higher your expectations about a book or a movie, the more likely you are to be disappointed, and this book did not provide the exception to this rule. It described the lavish lifestyle of the super-rich Gatsby in Long Island in the 1920s. Reading this around the time of the depression, might have had quite a different impact on folks, however, I was not particularly drawn into the descriptions of the fancy parties that Gatsby threw at his mansion in Long Island. The book describes Gatsby's attempt to woo Daisy Buchanan, a rich young married lady who lived across the Long Island Sound. The story is told by Nick Carraway who provides the perfect foil to the rest of the characters and it is definitely well written and a quick read. However, I really could not identify with any of the other characters and read the book more as an observer and didn't really get immersed in it. Overall, I was disappointed with the book and it didn't live up to the hype for me."
1427,Louis,"Oh wow. What can I say?To begin with, I can say I admire Fitzgerald's talent for writing. Never too formal, yet of a sufficient literary caliber, this book I went through quite quickly. Fitzgerald has this delicate tendency of finding the exact words for some phrasing, never juggling with an overdose of syllables and yet creating a whole world of thoughts from just one phrase. That is a rare gift indeed.After having seen the movie (which was brilliant as well in spite of the obvious - albeit in my eyes necessary - alterations) I can say that the book seems like a fraud now. I mean that in a very positive sense. Upon first sight, one would be inclined this book deals with the decadence of the rich (we're talking roaring 20s after all) and all of its excesses. However, contrary to the new blockbuster 'Wolf of wall street' (worst comparison ever I know, just trying to get a point across) there's so much more going on just beneath the surface. In truth, the story takes us through a journey of painful nostalgia, and an immoderate desire to sculpt a future that you can't control. As recognizable as it was, I keep returning to this theme every now and then and when I get to the point where the story pops up, a slow-gnawing bitterness fills my chest and blocks my throat. There's a little bit of everything in the story. Tragic, love, admiration, hope, defeat, magic. What probably fascinates me most is the storytelling's perspective. From an external reliable source, we hear all about Gatsby, yet are left wondering in the end what really went through his head all the time, even though he's the real star of the story (or is he?)... The reader is constantly left dangling, always just enough information, but room aplenty for suggestion and speculation.All in all, the Great Gatsby is a timeless classic and a novel that truly lives up to its name. Returning to this novel is not a question of possibility, but one of time. It's a book that grows on you over time, and one you can grow with. "
1428,Cornelia,"I finally read this. The writing is marvelous, it flows so smoothly. It's a classic tragic love story and so much more. If you've never read it, you definitely should. "
1429,Andy Miller,"The Great Gatsby was just as great reading it for the fifth time as it was the first time I read it 40 years ago. I can't imagine my good reads review could say anything that hasn't already been written--so I'm going to quote my favorite passages:1)--The following is the first two paragraphs of the novel:In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I have been turning over in my mind ever since. ""Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone"" he told me,""Just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.""2)Nick Carraway doesn't meet Gatsby in the first fourth of the book,and then only after they recognize each other from WWI with Nick not going that the fellow veteran was his host Gatsby-and this is the 1st description: ""He smiled understandingly--much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life...It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.""3) Perhaps my favorite, after Jordan Baker almost runs over someone while Nick is a passenger ""You're a rotten driver"" I protested. ""Either you ought to be more careful or you oughtn't to drive at all"" ""I am careful"" ""No, you're not.""  ""Well, other people are,"" she said lightly. ""What's that got to do with it?"" ""They'll keep out of my way"" she insisted. ""It takes two make an accident."" ""Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself"" ""I hope I never will,"" she answered. ""I hate careless people. That's why I like you""4) Jay Gatsby had bought a house directly across the bay from Daisy Buchanan as part of his plan to reunite with her; on the afternoon at the reconnection at Gatsby's home, Fitzgerald writes"" ""If it wasn't for the mist we could see your home across the bay"" said Gatsby. ""You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock."" Daisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever...5) After Daisy and Gatsby have fallen in love again, Gatsby talks to Nick about how he wanted to go back to the way things were before Daisy met her now husband Tom ""I wouldn't ask too much of her"" I ventured. ""You can't repeat the past."" ""Can't repeat the past?"" he cried incredulously. ""Why of course you can.""6) And finally, the last words Nick Carraway said to Gatsby the night that Daisy killed Mrs. Wilson, an act for which Mr Wilson would blame Gatsby, a misconception that Gatsby's honor and love for Daisy would not disavow. ""They're a rotten crowd,"" I shouted across the lawn. ""You're worth the whole damn bunch together."" I've always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever paid him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First, he nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile, as if we had been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time."
1430,Gracie,"I'd always meant to read this book, but never really got around to it. Finally, at the suggestion of my boyfriend, I picked it up this summer, and couldn't believe I'd waited this long to read such a great book. I'll admit, it took me a while to get to like some of the characters, but in all, the story itself was beautiful. It was a peek into the lavish, luxurious lifestyle of the 1920s/30s upper class, in all its glitzy, silk-laden glory. And yet that was only a mask, only a curtain that covered what occurred behind the ornate exterior. Jay Gatsby is so interesting to me- he throws these glorious parties, only to disappear and rarely show his face. He watches his old lover as she carries on her new life with a man who hardly seems to care, at least enough to be faithful. And yet what can he do? This beautiful tragedy is what really struck me, as I'm sure it has struck many a reader. In all, I would certainly recommend this book to anyone, whether or not they care for more historic books. The feelings are so human that we can relate to them even now, nearly a century later. "
1431,Florencia,"A mi me gustan mucho los grandes clásicos, y este es uno de los que tenía muchas ganas de leer. Tenía grandes expectativas antes de empezarlo y no me ha defraudado. Es un gran libro con una gran moraleja: antes y ahora vivimos en un mundo puramente superficial en el que abunda la hipocresía. El final del libro me hizo aprender una gran lección, GRANDE GATSBY"
1432,Jimmie,Timeless classic about the tragic death of a perfect love and life. Why have I never read this book before? Must add this book to my favorite books list.
1433,Celeste Corrêa,"Um grande livro com um dos mais apoteóticos finais da literatura universal:""Ali sentado na areia, a meditar nesse mundo antigo e desconhecido, imaginei o espanto do Gatsby quando, pela primeira vez, identificou a luz verde que brilhava na ponte do molhe da Daisy. Tinha vindo de longe para chegar a este relvado azul , e o sonho deve-lhe ter parecido tão próximo que só dificilmente poderia escapar ao seu abraço. Não sabia que o sonho era já uma coisa do passado, atrás dele, perdido algures na vasta obscuridade para além do clarão da cidade, onde os vastos plainos da República se desenrolavam sem fim sob o céu estrelado.O Gatsby acreditava na luz verde, no orgíaco futuro que, ano após ano, foge e recua diante de nós. Se hoje nos iludiu, pouco importa: amanhã correremos mais depressa, alongaremos mais os braços... Até que uma bela manhã... Assim vamos teimando, proas contra a corrente, incessantemente cortando as águas, a caminho do passado que não volta.""FIM"
1434,Relaytrixz," A very swell book old sport don't you think ? Fitzgerald tells us about nick , a very common new yorker who is creating a script on none the less ... thee jay gatsby. Mysterious gentleman jay gatsby is a a key part obviously to the story. Like a common romance gatsby wants the girl of his dreams all to himself . ""Daisy"" says gatsby as he stares across the patch of water keeping him and the love of his life and a very bright flashing green light from a byou in the water .  Nick is cousin to daisy who is wealthy due to her all american polo player husband. Yet gatsby is wealthy as well and gives his time to her unlike the husband . Well enough spoiling , the book is amazing overall , it has its suspensful moments and its moments where everything falls into place and is ruined by the past and yet again several climaxes to the love between daisy and old sport jay gatsby. Overall a good book for all ages . A romance, thriller , mystery book in my opinion. A very swell book and hook to the romanticos. Fitgerald combines the use of feeling and the mystery to create jay gatsby and keep the neighbor , cousin of daisy, nick in a wonder of a thousand stories to jay gatsby himself.Yet again i love you miss insco (; -cesar lamas"
1435,Nooran Ha'os,سيكثر حديثي عن هذة الحبكة الرائعة والتي اعتبرها من أفضل ما شاهدت وقرأت في حياتي.سأختصر القول بأني كرهت ديزي من البداية و وجدت شخصية توم زوجها قابله لأن تأخذ بطولة أحد الروايات الرومنسية بدور أنه الرجل الثري الرياضي مفتول البنية الذي يظهر في حياة البطلة الجميلة الذي تخلى عنها حبيبها المحارب الفقير.. لتعيش معه أروع لحظات الحب المتوجه بالزواج. بصراجة، لم أكره توم بيوكانان على الاطلاق كل سلوكه في الرواية كان مبرر فعلياً.أما بنسبة لجوردان فوجدتها تصف المعنى الحقيقي للغرابه لم أفهمها رغم محاولتي لأسترجاع بعض ماقالته ولكن بدون فائدة ولعل الراوي (نك) لم يفهمها أيضاً. وبما أني ذكرت الراوي لأبد لي القول أن نك مثال رائع للرجل المستقيم المتعلق بمبادئة وليس هذا فقط بلا أنه ذكي بقدر عمقة وأستيعابة للأمور.  :أما عن جأتسبي (العظيم) فهو الجنون بحد ذاته، أعتقد وببساطة أنه لا يوجد هناك رجل على وجه هذة الارض يحب أمراة على الطريقة الجاتسبية!! فعلاً أظنة وصل للجنون بالحب.
1436,Asma,"So far, most stories set in the past that I've read speak of how wretchedly poor the poor are. This book has been a window to the other side of coin. A startling contrast to what I'm used to and a plausible portrayal of such a world seeing as Fitzgerald, from what I understand, lead a similar way of life in that era and has a good idea of what went on at the time. It was insightful for a person stranger to their world. Reading about the rich and the wealthy in the 1920s was new to me. A colourful description of their extravagant way of living with a simple story- in so many words, of a hopeless man pining after the love of his life- at its core. Described so very eloquently by Fitzgerald that was warmly welcomed on my part. You see, I've got a thing for such picturesque articulacy. His prose is very poetic.Nick Carraway wins the award for best narrator. He's essentially a major character and yet he keeps a somewhat low profile throughout the story. And Gatsby. Prosperous good old Gatsby and his twitching simplicity. (view spoiler)[ A friend of mine told me that he was going to die in the end but I refused to believe it. When he met his early demise -ever so beautifully, I must add, with the circling leaves and all- I liked him and I kept hoping he'd come back to life even if it was in mysterious surreal conditions. (hide spoiler)] He's just a man who wants to rekindle an old flame. A character worthy of my affection. Which brings us to Daisy. At first I fell in love with her from the description. How can I not? Her voice, her perky liveliness and vibrant personality -unlike Myrtle, so bland- She reminds me of Scarlet O'Hara I don't know why. But then I came to realize, much like Nick did, that the whole bunch of them is rotten and selfish.As you question my love for the story, let me tell you this. Throughout the years I've developed a bad habit. I'd name my imaginary cat -mom doesn't allow pets at home- according to my interest at the time. I'm now quite sure that my cat's name is going to be Gatsby. Yes I do realize how random a proof that is. "
1437,Allison MacMillan,"1. A classic American story of lust, money, passion, and betrayal. This is my number one book because it is the first book that I was actually able to dig deeper into the hidden meanings beneath the story/plot-line. As I grew up reading, I only read for the story but never really got to see the deeper picture that is present in many books until this one. Maybe it was because my mind had grown up a little, or maybe because of a great teacher (gotta love Mr. West), but I connected with this book in a deeper way than I had previously with any other book. "
1438,JK,"The Great Gatsby is my favourite novel, and one of the most perfect I have ever read. Fitzgerald writes stunning, elegant, glittery prose that parallels the glamour of Gatsby's parties immaculately.Gatsby is all about pretense, deception, paper-thin relationships and shallow personalities. Fitzgerald shows us an America fallen from grace after World War I. The wealthy, respectable population have lost their moral compass, their social and moral values are decaying, and they are devoting their lives to meaningless, expensive pleasures. The American Dream is dissolving around their ears as a grim result.Fitzgerald explores the social etiquette of the wealthy, and compares those of 'old money' in East Egg, to those of 'new money' in West Egg. He uses the geography of both areas to contrast the social values expressed by individuals. The West Eggers are gaudy show-offs without social grace or taste, whilst the East Eggers are more graceful and elegant, but entirely lacking in heart.Nick Carraway as narrator is likeable in an instant, and becomes our trusted calm in the storm, a voice of absolute reason among the wreckages. He experiences an inner turmoil throughout the book, which isn't resolved until the final chapter. Although the fast-paced lifestyle of sin attracts and excites him, he also deplores it on a more sensible level. His relationship with Jordan is the perfect symbol of his conflict; he finds her sophisticated and intriguing, but is disgusted by her selfishness and habits of dishonesty. I had so much trust for Nick as narrator for this reason; I could identify completely with his mixed reactions, and felt the same throughout the novel.Jay Gatsby himself is originally introduced to us as a stable, polite, well-to-do gentleman. Our narrator is impressed by his lavish home, and his solid charm. Shortly after this first encounter, however, Fitzgerald begins to deconstruct Gatsby, exposing him as the insecure, tragic creature he really is. We begin to understand Gatsby's past, his rise from pauper to prince, and the reasons behind it; we begin to judge, begin to realise that there's something not so desirable about Gatsby's lifestyle after all. This is a mask designed to hide his inner torment; not only Gatsby himself, but many of his guests are wearing a similar mask.The love Gatsby feels for Daisy is something that really interests me. She really is a loathsome material girl, and although she is elegant, beautiful, and somewhat capable of showing affection, she is a bored, shallow debutante. Gatsby's obsession by her originates in his fixation on wealth and material, and as this continues he believes her to be the epitome of complete perfection. This is a dream which can never be realised, however, and I'd argue that this long hope is the entire crux of Gatsby's fate.Fitzgerald uses many beautiful symbols in the novel, my favourite being the eyes of Eckleburg in the valley of ashes. These were, to me, the eyes of God looking down on the sinners. Fitzgerald does infer, however, that symbols are what we make of them, and I would tend to agree.I could type up my thoughts on this novel all day, but they would never stray from my opinion of it being fantastic; I'll spare you. Every single word is wonderful; Fitzgerald has created something extravagant to match Jay Gatsby's hopes and dreams. This novel is absolutely pristine and one of the greats, without a doubt. I would struggle to name another work of fiction which has been written with such elegance and fluidity, without becoming a cumbersome, excessive read. I feel everyone should have read it at least five times, and be ready to discuss its merits at a moment's notice."
1439,Victoria Da,"The Great Gatsby was by far one of the greatest books I have ever read. In the commencement of the story, we are introduced by Nick Carroway. Nick is at a mental institution for an accohol addiction he formed while he was a young man in the ""roaring"" 1920's. He then writes about a dear friend he had named Gatsby. After that, we are taken back in time to when Gatsby was a young man and still alive. Gatsby lived an extravagant lifestyle and threw flambuoyant parties every weekend. However it was not for himself, but to get Daisy Buchanan's attention, the love of his life. Fitzgerald wrote this story with such beautiful words. My favorite quote was said by Daisy to her cousin Nick after realizing her husband was having an affair. She says, ""I hope she is a fool. Because that is the best thing a girl can be in this world. A beautiful little fool."" This story taught me many life lessons as it taught me to learn to let go of your past; something Gatsby should have done."
1440,Mira ,"I've been fascinated by the little I read about the Fitzgeralds and the wild fabled life they led, for some time, until I decided to read The Great Gatsby, and I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't expect this little novel to contain all the beauty and -if I may use the term- the 'charisma' it did. To be honest, I settled first on a 4-star-rating, but the novel remained fresh and insistent in my mind, and now, after more than two months of the first read, I find myself even more taken by Fitzgerald's exquisite prose, and critical depiction of the Jazz Age, that I cannot be satisfied with less than five hearty stars.The Great Gatsby is the story of the 'American dream' facing the wealth, sophistication, boredom and the selfishness the Jazz Age produced, all taking shape in one significant, contradictory Jay Gatsby. The narrative with which the story comes to life couldn't be more perfect. Every little description is most beautifully weaved, and measured on two major scales: Compassion, which draws a halo around Gatsby's character when first introduced as the charming, aloof host of the legendary parties held at Long Island, then gradually revealing his inner self, a confused man clutching to the long-vanished green light of his dreams and passions. The other scale is reason or in other words Nick Carraway, the narrator. Nick provides a sympathetic, yet rational glance at the feelings and struggles the characters go through, while remaining true to his principles and refusing to be affected by the devastating charm of the Eastern life. The feminine engine of the novel, Daisy Buchanan, was harder to interpret, and much more so to like. An aristocrat, attractive, but shallow young woman who kept Gatsby smitten for years, probably because she represented everything he ever wished to be: wealthy, zealous, and socially polished to live the most comfortable and easiest of lives. When reaching this point of the plot, Fitzgerald touches on what I thought to be one of the most important themes of the novel, and one I can particularly understand and feel the necessity of implying, and that is Gatsby's idolization, not of Daisy herself, but of the ""idea"" of her, and then suddenly realizing her imperfections when they meet again:""There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams--not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion.""A creative passion.. Looking more deeply into Gatsby, almost everything about him feels creative or rather created. He made up a new him, rising from poverty into an extravagant luxury, and even changed his name. And though all of this came up as a result to the passion and commitment he felt towards Daisy -which doesn't justify his choice of life and hopeless dreams-, however, it makes him all the more endearing; a flawed, misguided shadow that I couldn't help but love and pity.Different from Gatsby, yet similar to Daisy are her husband Tom, and her friend Jordan Baker, the three drawing an epitome of carelessness, fickleness, and irresolution in dealing with their and others' feelings. All of this stands in contrast to what I called- and many others before me did- the American dream, which in The Great Gatsby seems stifled by the immorality and the prosperous life the 1920s brought up. Fitzgerald brilliantly ponders over the condition of this dream of happiness and novelty, and sacrifices the soul of the ""Great"" Jay Gatsby in an attempt to bring his reflections into light."
1441,Kathy,"So glad I revisited The Great Gatsby after reading it the first time, over 30 years ago while in college! It was just as good as the first time but I found so many more similarities between the characters in the book and F. Scott Fitzgerald & his wife Zelda. "
1442,Maria Felgueiras,Extraordinary. 
1443,Chantal,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. All I can say, is wow. This was an amazing book. Gatsby, Daisy, and Nick were such interesting and complex characters with different sides of them that are slowly revealed throughout this classic novel. Gatsby is this extraordinary character who gives up everything for a woman, who goes by the name of Daisy. Daisy is also in a marriage, but her husband is unfaithful to her. Gatsby and Daisy fall back in love, and she ends up hurting him. As well as the woman who her husband is having an affair with, accidentally. Gatsby takes the fall for her, and ends up being murdered by the dead woman's husband. Gatsby gave up everything, including his life, for a woman who changed her mind. She didn't even come to the funeral, and moved on with her life as if it was nothing. This novel kept my eyes peeled to the page, and I stayed up late at night just to finish it. I fell in love with the characters and the book, and was genuinely upset when I turned the last page. This is a classic novel, and I understand now all the amazing reviews. Everyone in the world should read this book, definitely. "
1444,Malia,"I love revisiting this book periodically, and I did that again in 2013 after the movie came out. To me, this book is best enjoyed at the sentence level. What fantastic sentences."
1445,Josh Tatarian,"Very spectacular and short read. Literally my favorite required reading book ever and possibly my top 5 favorite books of all time. Fitzgerald is an amazing writer and does a great job at portraying the 1920s. Also, the movie that came out in 2012 or something was very close to the book and I really enjoyed it. If you are looking for a book full of wild parties and a good love story, this is the book for you. I must warn you though, there is quite a bizarre ending...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."
1446,Sahba Baghai,"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us the, but that's no matter - tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning... . So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."
1447,Libby,"Woah, crazy-good. I feel way out of my depth reviewing such a classic book, so basically, I really liked it. You don't exactly like the characters, they're self-absorbed and arrogant, but you do feel immersed in the moment of the book."
1448,Melinda Roberts,just re-read this. you should too.
1449,Michelle,"Joined Stephen Colbert's book club... :)I seem to have fallen into a nice little pattern of reading this once a decade-ish. It's one of the rare times when my atrocious memory feels like a gift, because I get to meet Nick, Gatsby, and Daisy for the first time all over again. I'm still reading my high school copy, annotated with excessive definitions (supercilious = overbearing, haughty) dictated by my epic Grade 11 teacher, Miss Taddeo, which adds an overlay of nostalgia to the whole experience.This book dazzles me. I love it. Nick holds me in the palm of his hand as he parcels out his tale in languid, pregnant episodes. I trust him entirely as a narrator, from the moment he opens with his father's advice: ""'Whenever you feel like criticizing someone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."" What I love is that Nick applies this not only to Gatsby, a desperate, self-made man, but also to Daisy and Tom, who've glided through life with every advantage possible. When he consents to shake Tom's hand at the end, he admits, ""I couldn't forgive him or like him but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child."" He is, to me, the perfect narrator.This time round I had the delight of discovering (or maybe rediscovering? who can say!) the epigram - the fantastic poem winkingly attributed to ""Thomas Parke D'Invilliers"". The image of the gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover tickles me to NO end. Oh F. Scott, I could gush about you like a fool all day."
1450,Mary Bronson,I thought this was a pretty good book. I loved the characters and plot of the story. I liked the ending. 
1451,Matt Ely,"The Great American Novel deserves the hype. The language itself is the most endearing character because (as infinitely many high school students have noted) the book's characters are generally unlikeable across the board. I myself disliked it in high school mostly, I think, due to the fact that I didn't know how people talked to each other yet. Parties are strange things to a fifteen year old, so large portions of the book were simply outside my ability to understand. Upon re-reading it, however, I saw the book with fresh eyes. The book is great at describing the hope and awkwardness of new social situations, the nostalgia that adults hold for a youth that may or may not have existed. What struck me straight was how many of these people I've met, and how many of them I myself have been. It's the great American novel because it is an inherently American story. Gatsby's American dream isn't hollow, it's just not what it appears to be. A quick and worthwhile read, more than deserving of the hype. "
1452,Crystal,I take back every horrible thing I ever said about this novel.
1453,Zanib  Sajjad,"Upon first starting the book, I was given the impression that it was slow paced and told through the lens of an insignificant and boring character; it was only as I trudged on that I realized that the tone for the story being told was perfect! The audacity and the grandeur of the 1920's is observed through the perspective of someone who lives outside of that grandeur: someone who can relate the theme of a dead dream, for that someone could see it as a product of the old. The excess in the 1920's dampened the true and wonderful dream of noble hearts and morals; this dying dream was like that of Gatsby's. It was horribly sad to see it die.Combining my love of history and the interesting lens through which the 1920's are portrayed, I absolutely loved this book. It was made even more grand with the haunting imagery and the ability to make me laugh at human follies, and weep at the injustice of mankind. I believe to truly appreciate this classic, one requires an understanding of the first world war, as well as the ensuing years known as the roaring 20's, during which time there was a great shift in human morals. And one must also not read this book as it is told on face value (the story of Gatsby loosing his love). It requires an adept eye to see deeper at the wars that changed human history. "
1454,Deja,I was absolutely engrossed in this book.
1455,"Jeanette  ""Astute Crabbist""","We studied this in Senior English. I was seventeen years old. All these years later I finally re-read it, and I'm adding another star. It's hard to believe how much of the depth I missed back then, when I was a dewy-eyed whelp with no life experience. My focus at that time was on the excesses and drunken debauchery of the Roaring '20s. This book is a masterpiece. My strongest impression on this second reading was how much all of us are like Gatsby, to varying degrees. We all cherish memories of a time in our lives when everything was so right and magical. What wouldn't we give to find a way to recapture that feeling of love and wholeness? "
1456,Susanclouse,"I am not sure why it took me so long to read this novel. It kept popping up as one of the greatest books ever written. Now that I have made a decision to read the classics, I often feel overwhelmed by the size of the novels. F. Scott Fitzgerald was able to produce a work of art in 115 pages and left me as the reader satisfied with the story and the characters.My first impression of Jay Gatsby was his use of props to promote himself to his community. All the glitz and booze and jazz and parties that attracted people to him. This false sense of American class and riches. We still see this today in our society. Everyone wants a piece of the rich, free parties and social standing. Individuals who falsely represent themselves to a shallow, selfish and self serving society.Jay Gatsby is a tragic figure in literature. He has created this fantasy world only to capture the heart of a very shallow and weak woman. This fails and his dreams die. The so-called friends disperse leaving him alone in his now dark and lonely house. He dies a tragic death and protects the woman he loved by not exposing her deeds. No one came to his funeral.This novel is very much valid today. Just win the lottery and see what happens. How the shallow people will flock to you, attend all your parties, admire you and love you. Jay Gatsby created himself. Full of props, mystery, riches and in love with the wife of another man."
1457,Clarissa,"F. Scott Fitzgerald the book The Great Gatsby is a marvelous novel about a man who is deeply in love with the wealthy beautiful Daisy Buchanan and would do any to get her.This novel is amazing and well written. The author F. Scott Fitzgerald writes this novel about a man name Jay Gatsby who is deeply in love with a beautiful women named Daisy Buchanan. Jay Gatsby loses the love of his life when he goes to combat. But she promises Jay that she will be here when he comes back. When Jay comes back Daisy is already married to a wealthy man named Tom Buchanan.When reading this book. It made me feel like a better person and glad to know that I am not as selfish as other human beings can be. The authors style is somewhat eye catching. Some of the pages are in letter format. Other than that, it is a novel that you can slightly close your eyes and picture every moment of it. There are plenty of characters in this novel but the main characters are Nick Caraway the one telling the story. Then there is Daisy and Tom Buchanan and Myrtle and George Wilson. And lets not forget Jordan Baker Daisy's best friend. Last but not least Jay Gatsby. Nick Caraway is a man who works as a bonds sales man who moves to east egg where the middle class live. He is related to Daisy Buchanan. Daisy Buchanan is married to Tom Buchanan whose family is wealthy. They live right across Nick. Across Nick there is West egg where the wealthy live. Myrtle and George Wilson live in the valley of ashes where the poor live. Jordan Baker is a pretty tall wealthy golf player who has a romance with Nick Caraway. And well Jay Gatsby. He is the man who was poor and later became rich and ends up having the girl of his dreams. Well for at least a second. The setting takes place in New York. Whether it's in East egg, West egg or the valley of ashes.East egg is a place were the middle class live. The valley of ashes is the worst. Well that's where the poor live. At the valley of ashes there is a billboard and that billboard has eyes. It sees everything you don't want to be seen. Last is West Egg. West egg is were the rich live. It's filled with beautiful houses and have a great view of the river.Jay Gatsby whose real name is James Gatsby fell in love with Daisy Buchanan. Daisy and Jay met a long time ago before she met Tom. Tom has a mistress whose name is Myrtle and Myrtle is married to a man name George. They live in the valley of ashes. Nick had recently moved in next to Jay Gatsby. Jay Gatsby throws big parties and one day Nick was invited. Jay then tells Nick about his life and how he has so much money. Nick later meets Jordan whose really good friends with Daisy. Jordan then tells Nick about Tom cheating on Daisy. Tom takes Nick to meet his mistress. Then Nick helps Jay Gatsby to reunite with Daisy Buchanan. I honestly can say there is no book that can remind me of the Great Gatsby. I am sure there is one out there that I haven't read. Special connections to this book I don't have any. But one thing for sure, love can be the most beautiful thing in life but also very dark.This novel is amazing and breath taking. It's mind twisting, sad and shows how pure evil wealthy people can be just to be happy. This is between old money and new money. Money can over power your way of living and how easy it is to get away from horrifying things. If you are interested in money, cheating and lying I suggest you to read this book."
1458,Laysee,"I first read The Great Gatsby as an undergraduate as it was a required text. I remember liking it but I didn’t have much life experience then to appreciate its intent or value its import. This week, I felt an irresistible pull to re-read it after watching Baz Luhrmann’s film adaptation of this classic American novel. I love the movie which I thought was beautifully made but I love the novel even more. Fitzgerald wrote scintillatingly elegant prose and some lines continued to hold me spellbound after the last page was turned.The story was set in fictional West Egg in Long Island, New York, in 1922 during the Jazz Age. At center stage was Jay Gatsby, a self-made, determined, and enigmatic millionaire devoted singularly to an incorruptible dream to regain his long lost love (Mrs Daisy Buchanan). We see Gatsby sympathetically through the eyes of the narrator, Nick Carraway, who lived next door to Gatsby’s opulent mansion. Nick (also Daisy’s cousin) was the first guest Gatsby formally invited to his excessively extravagant parties crafted solely to attract Daisy's attention but that were attended by total strangers. In one of his earliest reflections, Nick Carraway foreshadowed the utter futility of Gatsby’s obsession. Commenting on Gatsby buying the house where Daisy would be just across the bay, Nick observed, ""He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendour."" It described an optimistic innocence that was both poignant and touching. One of the loneliest scenes in the novel (and the movie) had Gatsby standing under the night sky with his arm outstretched toward the green light that beckoned in Daisy’s dock across the bay.Nick soon became Gatsby’s one true friend and confidant. Like Nick, the reader cannot help but admire Gatsby’s “heightened sensitivity to the promises of life” and “his extraordinary gift for hope”. For Gatsby, the penniless boy made rich, Daisy symbolized the unattainable, “gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor”. Gatsby believed with all his heart that he could repeat the past. Poor old sport.And all that would have been fine except Daisy was a shallow, golden girl. In fact, Nick frequently reduced Daisy to just a ripple of an alluring voice. At the much fussed over tea where Daisy finally met Gatsby after five years of separation, Nick detected in Daisy’s voice “a clear artificial note”. When Nick once remarked to Gatsby that Daisy had an indiscreet voice, Gatsby, in a rare moment of insight, acknowledged that ""her voice is full of money."" And yet the tragedy could not be averted. Nick observed, ""I think that voice held him most, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn't be overdreamed - that voice was a deathless song."" Right up to the fateful end, Gatsby held on to his dream, while Daisy lived up to her one aspiration – to be a beautiful fool. Love is a supremely lavish emotion. I think The Great Gatsby is a great novel because it speaks universally about man’s need to hope and dream in our pursuit of love, passion, or whatever it is we deem desirable. In life as Nick aptly noted, ""There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and the tired."" The essence of that hope or dream becomes all important because it can become all consuming. Ironically, however, once actualized, a dream loses its sustaining quality. Gatsby had believed in the green light but its significance melted away instantly when he finally brought Daisy to his mansion. “Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.”One can always recognize a truly enduring work of fiction by what it has to offer and what one brings to it at a future reading after a lapse of time. For me, The Great Gatsby is one such timeless treasure. This time round it deserves five bright stars."
1459,Makena House,"In the Drama, The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, relationships are tested, secrets arise and mystery is a norm in the West Egg district of New York. Nick Carraway moves to this part of the town, populated by the new wealth. His house is located next to a mysterious, young man by the name of Jay Gatsby, and across the way from his cousin Daisy Buchanan. Secrets arise as Nick finds out about a classmate of Daisy’s by the name of Gatsby, the man living next door who hosts lavished parties and over the top events, yet no one ever sees him. Daisy’s secrets are unraveled about the time before her marriage and the secrets she has become too hard to hold. With money, marriage and love on the line, we see a couple fight to save what they once had.The reunion of Gatsby and Daisy sparks a legendary love story, with tangled lies, secrets, as well as betrayal. 	The relationship between Gatsby and Daisy is a reconnected love story. They fight for their love with every ounce of their being, and when things go terribly wrong their love is truly tested. With little hope and little advances in their love, they fight to keep it alive, yet end it, dead. 	I love this book. I saw the movie and instantly started reading it. It is filled with emotion, love and drama, drawing in the reader. The mystical, yet adventurous characters, cause a roller coaster of feelings and hope. Once you begin this book you will never want to stop. The symbols and secrets haunt you, yet draw you closer to unraveling the mystery of Gatsby. "
1460,Falloutchboy,loved how the characters were written
1461,Pauline,A masterpiece. 
1462,Alex Leskanich,"I first read this last year, and with the new film adaptation forthcoming thought I'd give my opinion on whether it really is as good as often claimed. Well, it deals with a very narrow range of human experience - life as seen through the eyes of a not very memorable narrator and the people he encounters, who very often resemble him in terms of education and lifestyle, etc. This fact does not weaken the book. On the contrary, it offers a glimpse into how human behaviour is conditioned in ways so subtle and unobvious that to even mention them seems silly. Of course people want to emulate others whom they admire; of course they wish to be special. What is at issue is how a person goes about getting what they want, and here is where The Great Gatsby performs his ultimate trick: he fools the people he wants to impress by showing them what they expect, and they fall for it. You need only impressions to be part of a crowd, after all, not substance.I think it would be unfair to call the characters in the book superficial - their lives are no more superficial than anybody else. They have money, they spend it like water on stuff - nothing new there - even people who don't have money spend it on 'stuff'; what else? But more than that, the characters exhibit the most remarkable oblivion, despite their advantages in life. Gatsby's pursuit of the American dream is tinged with the most ludicrous irony - after all, you can't really fool yourself, not forever. You get what you want or you don't, and that's it. Deserve never comes into it in this little world he inhabits: opportunity - check; ambition - check. Bob's your uncle. And if you don't 'make it', why, join the crowd of other pretenders. I think that the 'moral' of the book is that the difference between being a somebody or a nobody is almost non-existent. Except when hidden in your own mind, the dream of significance reserved for yourself alone is a dangerous one. The somebodies are almost always in possession of things they didn't get through their own effort - whether it's intelligence, education, or money. There's little point in begrudging this situation - you can still get to the top even without these things, or so they say. The book is about hope, at bottom - hope for things you might get, hope for things you'll never get. And if it's about hope, then it is surely just as concerned with disappointment, a condition so common most people just live with it all their lives, accepting it as the natural order of things. I suppose the point is that you can't experience true disappointment without experiencing true hope. It is hope that creates people like Gatsby.This is a brilliant passage:'Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter - tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther...And one fine morning - 'Completely compelling, a book that lives up to its reputation. "
1463,Betsy Ehlers,"Years after being forced to read this book for school, I decided to give it a second chance and absolutely loved it. The writing is better than this, and Fitzgerald creates female characters with more than one dimension. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll skip back a few pages and make sure you didn't miss something."
1464,Galina,Brilliant! Today I finished it in Russian and tomorrow I will start over again in English :) An absolute masterpiece! 
1465,J.,"The original title for this work was ""Trimalchio in West Egg' a nod to the Satyricon. Such a title conjures up images of excess and homoeroticism. On the first count ‘excess’ there is little argument. Tony Tanner points out that Gatsby is excessive, foolish and foredoomed so the whole book suggests is America. No wonderland but a wasteland of ashes. Our wastelands of failed dreams are presided over by God in the form of T.J. Eckelburg.Our narrator Nick identifies with Gatsby and makes him into a hero. To Nick Gatsby's passion is heroic. As Tony Tanner points out Nick is a 'self isolating voyeur' avoids emotional and sexual engagements. He is a watcher - “Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.” Nick puts his inimitable spin on things. Voices are ‘full of money’ ‘names float’ upwards. Gatsby is stuck in the past therefore he cannot exist in the present. What is remarkable about Gatsby is we never get a clear physical description of him, of his clothes yes, but of the man no. Fitzgerald's images float imperceptibly into view. “I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others--young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.”The prose is wonderful. I could read these beautiful sentences over and over. Fitzgerald's language crackles with energy. “The track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which as it sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever.”One of the most famous quotes is the last line “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.” This line suggests immigration, reinvention, sea borne imperialism, the overall message being you can’t beat your upbringing. We are slaves to our fate and to our origins. Why a movie version of ‘The Great Gatsby’ will never be successful. Answer- language itself is the main character in the Great Gatsby no movie script could ever capture the beautiful prose. Still I’m glad that as a result of the movie more people will read the book. The Great Gatsby champions the ideal that we can reinvent ourselves and keep doing so. This book would stand up to a re-reading. It’s full of vivid scenes and is highly epigrammatic. This is a favourite book of mine, of course I highly recommend it."
1466,Dominic Manganiello,"A great story with plenty of symbolism, I enjoyed this book much more than I would have originally expected. It's a great little window into the 1920's, and gives some valuable insight into the culture and paradigms of the time, albeit not too often. It also has a great sense of mystery to it, as Gatsby is continuously built up, and you're only given bits of his story periodically throughout the novel, so you're not suddenly getting a dump of backstory, but also not getting too little, finding a great balance. What struck me most, though, was how brief it was; only nine chapters in 180 pages, it wasn't as long as you'd expect, managing to tell a captivating story with plenty of underlying messages in such a short novel. Altogether, I'm glad I read it, and would definitely read it again--not something I say often."
1467,Joe Dwyer,"F. Scott Fitzgerald tells us of the American Dream (an illusory myth imbibed by so many modernists), in his classic novel, The Great Gatsby (1925). Staring off into the effervescent starlight glistening off that wondrous West Egg sound, Gatsby believed an illusion that would never materialize; but he, like so many of his generation, refused to accept disillusionment—ironically this ultimately led to even worse despair: “[Fitzgerald’s] tormented characters seek desperately to know what lies ‘behind the horizon,’ as they struggle to find meaning in a world that seems essentially empty of meaning.” And yet, even if he had won back Daisy, in the end he eventually would have realized that his dream of her was just that: an unfeasible illusion. Daisy would never aspire to Gatsby’s mythical muse. Nevertheless, man’s search for meaning remains steeped in nostalgia and regret: “Suffering and the very need to explain suffering are [...] the source of man’s action and creativity [...] man is ultimately a free agent, bring most of his grief upon himself.” Disillusionment and stark isolation linger ominously with the hopes and dreams of mankind; beneath an ever-emptying sky, man wanders forward as the past incessantly swells up before him as Nick Caraway laments in that immortal final passage in The Great Gatsby:""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year receded before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther… And one fine morning—So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."" "
1468,Chrissi,"Very good, I was hooked from the beginning. Such a sad ending though."
1469,Kipi,"I must be the only person in America who didn’t read this story in high school, so I came at it without any of those leftover my-English-teacher-made-me-read-it prejudices. I’m really kind of glad about that. I was able to enjoy the artistry of Fitzgerald’s prose as an adult. I say that because I sincerely believe…for the most part…the significance of the allegory in this one will be lost on most high school students…not all…most.The story, set in the 1920s, is narrated by Nick Carraway, who lives in the imaginary Long Island neighborhood of West Egg and is a neighbor to Jay Gatsby. Gatsby is a profusely wealthy but aloof man who attained said wealth in ways that may be questionable…no one seems to know for sure. What they do know is that his is “new” money, and there is the downfall. It seems that Gatsby worked himself from ordinary farm boy from the Midwest to fabulously wealthy in order to win the love of Daisy Buchanan, who is unfortunately already married to old money in the form of her extremely selfish arrogant husband, Tom. Daisy and Tom live across the sound from Nick and Gatsby in East Egg, where old money resides. Nick’s first glimpse of Gatsby is of him staring across the water at a mysterious green light with his arms held out toward it in longing. The light lies as the end of the dock where Daisy lives.Fitzgerald’s prose is wonderful:Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and turning my head to watch it, I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbor’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.The silver pepper of the stars…one of my favorite phrases in the entire book.As I said, I would categorize the story as an allegory. Gatsby is said to represent striving for the American dream, Daisy representing the dream and Gatsby himself the one who, no matter how hard he tries or what he is willing to do, can not attain it. The dream remains always just out of reach.As I read, I also thought of this passage from Ecclesiastes 2: I denied myself nothing my eyes desired; I refused my heart no pleasure. My heart took delight in all my work, and this was the reward for all my labor. Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind; nothing was gained under the sun.I didn’t really find that I felt much for any of the characters, seeing them more as what they symbolized than as real people with real lives and feelings. The emptiness of it all, which is probably why I thought of verses in Ecclesiastes, is what struck me. This is definitely not a happily-ever-after story. This may all make it sound like a bit of a downer, but I didn’t come out of that way. Like I said, the beauty of the language makes the read well worth it, but it also left me thinking about priorities…and that’s never a bad thing."
1470,Rachel Seo," The author of the book The Great Gatsby (1925) is an American author, Francis Scott Fitzgerald. The book is set up in 261 pages, and this novel is a brilliant piece that evidently shows American dream in the 1920s while it conveys important themes such as greed, power, and betrayal. The story begins in 1922, in the wealthy and bustling town of West Egg. In the novel, Nick is an omniscient narrator. He has a small cozy house in the West Egg, next to the Gatsby’s luxurious palace. Gatsby is a protagonist who sets splendid parties every Saturdays. ‘He hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy’ (Nick, 112). As the quote shows, Gatsby and Daisy falls in love again, and Daisy’s husband Tom becomes highly irritated of their relationship. Few days later, it turned out that Gatsby's car has killed Tom's mistress, Myrtle. Although Daisy was driving the car at the time, but Gatsby decides to cover it up instead.  I gave the book five stars since I learned several significant lessons from reading this book. First of all, I learned that we should not let our emotions or instant feelings lead to judgment or decisions. For instance, in the book, after Myrtle’s death, George lets his instant feelings of anger drive him to commit murder and then suicide. Also, Gatsby’s strong love for Daisy caused him to dedicate his life to Daisy. However, he does not realize Daisy’s self-centeredness. Although when Daisy committed crime, she allows Gatsby to be the reprehensible person. Additionally, I learned that money is a corrupted and inappropriate method of trying to gain happiness. Money make us happy for a moment and a short period of time, however, it is ephemeral. We cannot buy sincere happiness through money. "
1471,Alice Gray,"Wow I have never enjoyed a book for school as much as this one.I thought it was captivating, beautiful, and real.The writing was done in such a natural way, yet almost evasive and not straightforward."
1472,Blair,A huge leap forward for Fitzgerald after his first two novels. A justly acclaimed jewel.
1473,Diana Barrett," The Great Gatsby is a novel about the American Dream and the effects it can bring upon a person. Fitzgerald delivers the 20’s feel with this book. He brings up topics like the prohibition, bootleggers, and the reckless people of the roaring-twenties. The main character, Jay Gatsby was a man full of passion, ambition, and who was driven by possession, but he was also naive and in love. He had his mind set on money to win Daisy Buchanan, the girl who had his heart in the palm of his hand. Gatsby believed he was too poor for Daisy, which is why he was so focused on, and eventually successful in, becoming rich. Gatsby’s success is what gave this book the American Dream approach. Although Daisy had a daughter and was married to a wealthy man named Tom Buchanan, Gatsby was still convinced that he could repeat the past. Francis Scott Fitzgerald wrote this book through the mind of Nick Carraway, who was a cousin to Daisy and a neighbor to Gatsby. Fitzgerald brings out the idea of the American Dream very clearly. He does this by continuously changing Gatsby’s success story. Fitzgerald constantly reminded his readers just how successful Gatsby really was: the parties, the flashy automobiles, the recurring details of his mansion, and things as simple as Gatsby’s dialogue. Gatsby’s obsession with winning Daisy back was what really took a toll in the story. After receiving wealth in life, he still needed the girl to live up to his own expectations. Fitzgerald wrote, “If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream.” This quote in the book shows that the American Dream can have a negative impact on men like Gatsby. Gatsby wasted so much of his time focused on one thing, which slipped right through his fingertips, and it ruined him. The Great Gatsby was beautifully written and is worth the read. It is an emotional roller coaster ranging from excitement, sadness, and full of moments that will be keeping you on the edge of your seat, which will make you want to never put the book down. It will change the reader’s perspective on how the American Dream really is and just how far greed, and always wanting more can take a turn in one’s life. "
1474,Peggy,"Fitzgerald casts his gimlet writer's eye upon love and success. The characters we meet are driven by money, power, and desire; they destroy themselves and each other easily. The wealthy lead a glittering life, but there is no loyalty among them. The story handily pierces all cultural illusions about the American dream and it's written in such clean, pure prose that this novel may never go out of style. Highly recommended for all U.S. readers. "
1475,Felixthecat,"Nick is a writer. This is one of his stories. When he was young he lived beside a huge castle. Bet him never meet the owner yet. And when there was a party from the castle. He met the owner name Gatsby first time. And he loved nick’s cousin Daisy. So nick try to help Gatsby to meet with her. Gatsby was her EX-boyfriend. But some reason he can’t stay with daisy for a long time. So daisy merry with another man name tom. And daisy and Gatsby make a plan to escape. But while daisy was driving Gatsby’s car she had an accident, she bump a woman and Gatsby wants to make daisy innocent so he says that he did it. And the husband of the woman came to Gatsby’s house and kills Gatsby. But Daisy didn’t come to the funeral. There was only one man in his funeral. It was nick. When he had a party in his house he mad 100s of people but in his funeral only 1."
1476,Maayan K,"I know I'm late to the party here, but I'd never read this book before. I tried to put aside expectations as much as I could.What I read was a slight, lyrical, perfectly constructed novel; a delicate study of the title character, which doesn't reveal too much or too little. Nick Caraway plays the straight man to the obsessive self-made millionaire Gatsby, his beautiful and passive cousin Daisy, and her brutal/rich husband Tom Buchanan. There's also Jordan, the cynical/materialistic young woman that Nick takes up with, who hovers throughout.This is a pretty near perfectly assembled book. A small delight. It certainly resonates with various themes (that I'm sure appear in many a highschool notebook) - obsession with materialism, the american dream, empty relationships. Most of the people in the book, including both women, have sort of shell-like lacks of personality, which is disturbing. The whole thing is situated in the flush atmosphere of wealthy 1920s glamour. Though Fitzgerald does just as good a job evoking the sordid misery of the ""ash heaps"" - that place without even a name. There are people left behind from this rush forward to wealth and position and the results are not pretty. "
1477,Sony,"OMG! Why haven't I read this before? I don't even think I was ever assigned to read this book. I don't know if I should take that up with my school board, or if I conveniently skimmed it and read the cliff notes in high school, but I feel a great injustice has occurred as a result.I LOVED this book. It has so many layers, and it's so poignant, and unsettling. This is mostly because of the way Fitzgerald writes. The language he uses is at once eloquent and also personal. It took me awhile to get into this book, because of the high-brow use of English, which I usually find off-putting, but after I came to know the narrator and interested in the mystery of who Gatsby was, I was hooked! The layers I'm referring to are two-fold, first the style of writing, and the use of characters to allude to enduring human themes, especially in our American culture. I'm sure a thorough literary analysis has been done on this book a thousand times over, but my own personal take from this novel is that the narrator (Nick) is giving us a memoir on why he is disillusioned with the ideals of traditional American values like meritocracy, hard work, and justice. Gatsby and the life he aspired to, the life Nick had the priviledge to be born into was not at all what it looks like from the outside. And it is only through knowing Gatsby, and forcing himself to see the world through Gatsby's eyes that Nick understand what its like to be an outsider and how shallow his world really is. I love the use of symbolism. It feels like every character and sometimes the material possessions and ideals they carry represent something real and tangible in our world. I'm particularly interested in the themes pertaining to race and gender. It's difficult to know what the author truly thinks on these matters but there are hints. What is clear are his thoughts on wealth, idealism, and virtue. The way he wrote out the conflict surrounding these themes are relevant today. And that's really saying something, since this novel was written in the 1920's. These themes are constant, which is both sad, and incredible. The language is beautiful. Sometimes Fitzgerald comes close to purple prose, IMO, but everything he writes seems especially thoughtful and purposeful, so even when it could be read as purple, its metaphoric meaning cancels out that possibility. I was really moved by this story, and I think that I have a new role model for writing. I want to write like this guy, so much so that I went online to search more information about his life and the reception to this novel. Unfortunately, it seems he was denied proper praise and died thinking it was a failure. Gatsby deserves all of the accolades its receiving now and much more. I'm sorry he died without getting his just reward for sharing this with the world."
1478,Jihan Bok,"A simple story juxtaposed against the jarring excesses of the roaring twenties, a single beacon of humanity in a convoluted world. This is the story of Gatsby, and one told in the lilting, melancholic, dissolutive tones of Nick Carraway, a seemingly objective observer in the course of the novel's lifespan. The beauty of this piece comes not from the flashy (if well-worded) depictions of economic wealth, the splendour of the thriving classes, or the blinding, gaudy displays of Gatsby's parties. Rather it is in the quiet moments of crushing despair, the gradual acknowledgement of humanity’s shortcomings, and the final conceding to its total ability to devastate. "
1479,Isabella,"I feel like people give Gatsby a low rating because they did not understand the novel. This book is truly a classic for a plethora of reasons, but those reasons are not as inconspicuous as one may hope.At first, when I read this book my sophomore year of high school, I absolutely abhorred it. I hated all of the characters, even the narrator, Nick Carraway. I thought they were all horrible people, which made it hard for me to get into the novel. When I shared my loathings with my brother, he replied, ""Isabella, hating them all is the point."" After that, I considered the novel's message for a while, but I kind of let it go.Several months after, I picked up the novel again for a research paper so I could study it in depth. I wanted to understand the era, the characters, and Fitzgerald's (seemingly complex and sometimes nebulous) telling of events. I began reading carefully and with an open mind, and once I finished it for the second time, it became my favorite book of all time.If you want to truly enjoy this book, I would highly suggest researching the Jazz Age in depth, as well as Fitzgerald's life. The parallels between the author's life and the novel are truly astounding, for it is believed that Gatsby and Carraway both represent the dichotomy of Fitzgerald's personality: Gatsby encapsulates his carelessly frivolous lifestyle, while Nick is the side of him that realizes the revolting corruption of the Roaring Twenties. Additionally, Daisy indubitably was based off of the women in the author's life. Some believe Daisy to be Fitzgerald's first love, Ginevra King, and others believe her to be his wife, Zelda. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote this novel to highlight his views about this era because he was about one of the only ones who saw this problem. By understanding what the author saw, you can easily see why this novel is such a masterpiece.Do not expect to enjoy this book if you disregard the beauty of the English language. Also, if you are not a believer in symbolism, this book is not for you. The subtle genius of each of the symbols is wholly fascinating. If you are simply reading this book to get it over with, you will not find this book enjoyable. Trust me. Fitzgerald truly crafted his novels with the utmost care and beauty, and this should not be taken for granted.The Jazz Age had a scintillating and glamorous facade that veiled the immense corruption underneath, and the people who partook in the frivolity often reflected the former concept. So, if you cannot see this, you'll hate everything about The Great Gatsby. The people are truly horrible and the things they do epitomize immorality and selfishness. But, as my brother would say, that is the point. "
1480,Vivi,what a great novel!
1481,Michelle Rodriguez,Reading the novel is nothing like watching the movie. You get more feeling from the novel and the hate for daisy is more vivid. Amazing work on F. Scott Fitzgerald's part!
1482,Zack Mollhagen,There is so much style and finesse bursting off of each page that it has resonated with me more than any other novel has. It's deliciously crafted prose have as much flavor long after you've read them as they do the very first time.
1483,Marybeth Yates,"F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote this novel to show his fellow Americans that you can have all of the money in the world and live a very luxurious life, but still feel lonely. He was not getting caught up in all the hype of having a nice car and a nice house and being materialistic. Actually, F. Scott Fitzgerald moved out of America to get away from all of this. He wanted to really prove his point by making this issue into something people would be very interested in. The theme of this book was materialism. This is what people became in the twenties. This book shows how you can have everything that you can buy. You can buy fancy sports cars, houses, etc. But you can not buy friends and family. No matter how rich or famous you are, you can still lack that. The style of the novel is a narration. It goes in order, and it explains what happens by events. F. Scott Fitzgerald put it this way so people could understand it as much as they could because it is a heavier topic to understand. Fitzgerald wanted to really get his theme across as easily as he could to society to show them that objects do not matter. I really enjoyed the novel because it makes you think about what is most important in life. It also makes you think a lot, about everything. I would change some of the writing and language in the book only because it is more difficult to understand now. Other than that, the book was wonderful."
1484,Shirin sh,"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning---- So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."
1485,Sam Woods,"I read this on a plane trip home from Cairns, and I immediately loved it. I keep wishing that I could experience this book all over again, as if reading it for the first time. I just really liked it that much! "
1486,Jrnl010,"The Great Gatsby is een klassieker en dat is volkomen terecht. De stijl is mooi en de personages blijven je bij. Een boek dat je om de zoveel tijd wilt herlezen, het liefst in het Engels. Buitencategorie. "
1487,Neil," Now that Hollywood is coming out with a new—and hopefully improved—version of THE GREAT GATSBY, it’s time to take a look at the classic literary novel that the movie is based upon. F. Scott Fitzgerald penned GATSBY during the robust economy of the post-war, early 1920s, when the newly rich were crowding into mansions on Long Island, across the bay from the old money rich, steeped in tradition, who were the true wielders of power, not pretenders to the throne. Among the newly rich is Jay Gatsby, whose source of wealth is dubious, and his taste in clothing tending toward the garish. He’s “great” because he has seemingly been able to acquire all the trappings a person should need to be fabulously wealthy and happy—but he’s not happy. The one prize that still eludes him is Daisy Buchanan, who lives with her husband, Tom, across the bay where the old money is entrenched. Through Nick Caraway, the narrator of the story and admirer of Gatsby, a meeting is a social is arranged that brings Daisy over to meet her former beau, Jay Gatsby. Their love is rekindled, and she confesses her disappointment at her husband’s superficiality. He’s not who or what she was expecting to marry. Following an argument with Daisy’s husband, she accidentally runs down a woman on the road who is the paramour of Daisy’s husband, a commoner Tom is contemptuous of: ""He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He's so dumb he doesn't know he's alive."" Gatsby wants to protect Daisy, so he takes the blame for the death, while Daisy goes back to her husband. Tom informs the recent widow that it was Gatsby who killed his wife (not Daisy, and the man assumes it must have been Gatsby she had been having the affair with. He goes up to Gatsby’s mansion, finds and kills him, and then kills himself. Then despite the lavish parties Gatsby held with hundreds of guests, hardly anyone shows up to his funeral. The lesson appears to be that old East Coast money in entrenched and quite capable of protecting itself, even against criminal acts, while leaving suffering and retribution to those not in their club, such as mid-westerners who are newly rich. This is a timeless classic that has aged well. It continues to be one of my most favorite novels and has been honored as one of the top tier novels in American Literature. I give it FIVE stars and am looking forward to the movie version."
1488,Tamara,"Bit ću iskrena i reći da me knjiga nije oduševila na samom početku. Mogla bih ju podijeliti na tri dijela: prvi koji mi je bilo pomalo dosadan i tjerao me na pomisao da bih mogla odustati od čitanja, drugi u kojem sam počela shvaćati da ta ""dosada"" nije uzaludna i da ima svoju poantu i treći u kojem je ta poanta i prikazana, koji me oduševio i koji je cijeloj knjizi dao značenje! Veliki Gatsby priča je o mladom bogatašu koji priređuje spektakularne zabave u svojem domu, tajanstven je i o njemu kolaju priče, no okružen je ljudima dokle god im pruža ono što ih zadovoljava, a to su upravo te zabave i bezbrižnost. U pozadini svega toga je njegova beznadna ljubav prema Daisy. Priču pripovijeda Nick Carraway kojemu se ta ispraznost „vremena nakon Prvoga svjetskog rata koje je po raskalašenosti ostalo zapamćeno kao jazz razdoblje“ (opis s korica knjige) nikako ne sviđa.Oduševilo me kako knjiga pokazuje da se neke stvari nikada ne mijenjaju, poput ispraznosti novca, poput ljubavi za koju su neki od nas spremni učiniti sve, poput nesretnih ljubavi, ali i poput ljudske pokvarenosti i okrutnosti koja je ovom knjigom prikazana na tako dobar i istinit način. Tužna i predivna knjiga o kojoj se razmišlja. Preporučujem i izdvajam citat: ""Ne mogu vam, stari druže, opisati kako sam se iznenadio kad sam otkrio da ju volim. Neko sam se vrijeme čak nadao da će me odbaciti, ali nije, jer je i ona voljela mene. Vjerovala je da mnogo znam jer sam znao stvari koje su njoj bile nepoznate. Eto, tako sam se udaljio od svojih ambicija i svake sam minute padao sve dublje u ljubav i najednom, ni za što više nisam mario. Što će mi veliki pothvati kad mi je bilo ljepše pričati njoj o onome što kanim poduzeti!"""
1489,Maan Kawas,"A tragic novel at various levels, full of deep meanings and insights! The novel seems at the surface to be centered around the dissatisfied love affair between Gatsby and Daisy, and the pursuits and efforts of Gatsby to fulfill his own dream of uniting with his beloved Daisy. In order to be qualified to propose to Daisy, he had to meet the requirements of her high social rank, thus, got involved in bootlegging and other illegal deeds, which finally enabled him to purchase a huge luxurious mansion as well as throw legendary parties, attended by unknown people. Those parties showed the greedy nature of the social climbers around him, who cared about wealth, easy money, and pleasure. However, there is are differences in values and social acceptance between the old rich and the nouveau rich, who were considered lower in the eyes of the old rich. A major theme in the novel is disillusionment of the American dream in the 20’s, coupled with moral disintegration, emptiness of wealthy people, marital unfaithfulness, cynicism, and seek of pleasure. Unfortunately, shattered dreams showed the ugliness of the new reality. "
1490,Victoria Flores,"*Formal Review*The Great Gatsby is a book for people who are looking for a great novel that makes you think and find significance. I would deeply encourage people to read this book, as I believe that it is really well written and it tells one of the most interesting love stories I have ever read. The Great Gatsby truly deserves its title as the ""Great American Novel."" Maybe, not because of it's greatness but more of how American it is, in the way that it interprets the American Dream. Something about the way that F. Scott Fitzgerald strings words together makes this book so beautiful to me. I find the romance in this novel fascinating and I love how the main character and most romance characters share this extraordinary gift of hope, that if they achieve their dream, they'll be happy. I think one of the reasons that I am so interested in this book is that if I had to choose to live in another time period, I would choose the 1920's. A quote that I love concerning this is: ""The dream was to, you know, have a leisurely and debaucherous life where you had enough money to buy fancy new cars and enough whiskey to crash them."" (John Green), I think that that quote describes the Great Gatsby so perfectly. Also, I am amazed that all the characters are so different and complex and even though some of them are highly unlikeable like Tom Buchanan. I am interested in all the characters and I think they all bring a special flavour to the book. One of my favourite parts concerning Tom is when the author describes him so perfectly by saying ""He was one of those men who achieves such an acute, limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterwards savours of anti-climax."" My favourite character by far, is Jay Gatsby because of how mysterious he is. I love the fact that even though there are so many people that attend his parties yet nobody really knows him. I think that one of the most romantic things in this book, is that even though he doesn't drink or enjoy his parties (OR USE HIS POOL) or really care much about his extravagant life, he did all of that so he could live across the bay from Daisy and impress her one day. The Great Gatsby has many symbols including the famous green light. Fitzgerald mentions it during the book, in which he says, 1CGatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that 19s no matter 14 tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther 26. And then one fine morning- so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past. I think Gatsby believed in the green light because he thought that no matter how far that light seemed he would finally reach it. To Gatsby the green light meant everything and his everything was Daisy, but the green light soon went out and so did Gatsby. I think that throughout our lives we are all looking for our ""green light, that keeps us with the motivation and inspiration to keep going. I think F. Scott. Fitzgerald is trying to say that Gatsby represented the idea of the American Dream since he is a dreamer and obsessed with the past. Daisy symbolises money and the upper class, which is everything that Gatsby wanted. The American Dream fits in to Gatsby's life perfectly because it says that even if you are poor, you can become anything you want. For Gatsby, he's always wanted to be rich and to be able to win Daisy over. At one point in the book Daisy says ""I hope she 19ll be a fool 14that 19s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool."" I love this because I think that Daisy is trying to be a beautiful little fool because it's the only way she can see to get through life. Especially because it lets her escape troubling issues in her life like her undying love for Gatsby This was not an easy read for me but it was a book that I could not put down. I truly recommend it to anyone who is up for a challenge or for anyone that would want to enjoy some great American literature."
1491,Steve,"The story of the enigmatic Jay Gatsby, a self-made man with a mysterious past. He throws wild parties but is rarely seen, almost no one gets an invite, they just turn up. I don't want to say any more, I've seen reviews that sum up almost the whole story and really spoil the book. What you need to know is it is a classic of American literature and is a portrait of the 'Jazz Age' of the 1920s and the world of the ultra-rich upper classes of New York. It is really intricately plotted but also beautifully written with some delightful turns of phrase (""the silver pepper of stars""). It's a story of money, love, jealousy, infidelity and quite a bit more.I thought this was a really good book. I debated whether to give this 4 or 5 stars because while I liked it I didn't love it, but this isn't a book you are supposed to love. It is a book to make you think, to take you back to a very interesting and in some ways exciting time and place. It may be a classic, but it's a short one at less than 150 pages so it doesn't require a big time commitment. So if you are thinking of giving it a try, then go for it!"
1492,Zeeshan Ahmed,"What a book! The novel is just brilliant. Told from the first-person perspective, the novel shows how some people keep living in the past, and achieve whatever they could just because of someone or something that they left behind. They keep living in an illusion, and keep dreaming. For it is past, which drags them to the future. But it has its own price. Fitzgerald is an amazing writer, and the way he balances his characters and uses symbolism to convey the story, is just brilliant. This novel also reflects the ongoing tension between materialism and non-materialism. Some people who can go through anything, face anything, and then just go back to their materialistic world. World, where money is one of the primary emotions, and things can easily replace people. And then there are people who are complete opposite. The Great Gatsby is a great novel, and a must-read for everyone. To quote the novel itself:“So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”"

1494,Graham,"Odious and awkward characters who have lost their deep humanity to hedonistic pursuits. And so shallow! My goodness, I found this really hard to read as there was nothing pleasurable about any of these careless people. At one point I was hoping that Nick would just man up and run away with Jordan just to get away from the Gatsby-Tom-Daisy triangle. And then there was that dreadful Catherine and Myrtle business: whatever happened to the little doggie anyway? And Tom's misdirection of Mr Wilson to Gatsby at the end.... Well....!Glad to have finished it. But oh how the characters need a large wet fish to smack some sense into them."
1495,Joshua Yoon,"I can't say the ending surprised me, since I had watched the movie before. But it was just as tear-jerking. In the end, you the reader, realize something new about Gatsby, something that seemed so obvious; Gatsby is a very lonely character. He dies, not knowing if his lover really did love him. He was murdered wrongly, having not committed an actual crime. All the wealth that he spent his life gathering (for his lover (Daisy)) was for nothing and no one attended his funeral because of his supposed ""murderous act."" "

1497,Tommy,"Reread for the first time since soph year in high school. I thought about only giving it 4 stars but felt a bit pretentious doing so, and went ahead with 5. I do believe part of the appeal and inclusion in the ""Mandatory School Lit Canon"" is its relatively short length, accessibility and somewhat critical look at the excesses of youth. The thoughts, length and sentence structure are rather direct and simplistic. I was also surprised upon post-read reflection how Bonfire of Vanities felt like a more complex, modern, grown-up version of the same story. The above thoughts in no way are meant to denigrate the overall value and enjoyment of this work, or mean I enjoyed Bonfire more - the characters in Bonfire are less likable and it dragged at times so I actually didn't. The imagery and language in Gatsby is at times amazing and very enjoyable. For me, all of the characters continue to have that ephemeral quality to them, and yet don't exactly leave me cold as characters do in other works. It somehow works well for me. I also think this stands up better than some other works I had to read in high school and enjoyed. So if you've never read it, do it! If it's been a while, it's a good late summer/early fall read. It's one of the easiest classics to read."
1498,Yaneli,"The Great Gatsby by F.Scott Fitzgerald is a novel about Tom and Daisy comitting adultery. Tom and Daisy are married, they are wealthy, and they are very high class. Tom is having an Affair with Myrtle his mistress, the funny part is that Daisy already knows that he's having an affair with Myrtle, Daisy knows her. Gatsby is also wealthy, he has a mansion and has the one of the best cars, Daisy is having an affair with Gatsby, Gatsby and Daisy already knew each other for 5 years but they couldn't be together because he was poor and he was gonna go to War. Gatsby told Daisy to wait for him but she got tired and married tom that had all these riches. Gatsby and Daisy finally got to see each other after so many years, The reason why they met again was becasue Nick one of Tom's Friends organized a tea party for her and Gatsby. As Gatsby and Daisy continue to go out, Gatsby wanted Daisy to leave tom and tell him she never loved him, but in Surprise he found out she had a 3 year old daughter. Tom right away suspected that there was something going on between Gatsby and his Wife Daisy, making him want to know even more about Gatsby.This Book is not only based on Adultery, but is also based on Dishonesty because Gatsby lied about his past, he lied about coming from a wealthy family, and coming from the best college just so that he could impress Daisy. Tom lied about Daisy's religion so that he won't have to divorce her. And well Daisy lied about running Myrtle over, so Gatsby took the blame for her and died because of it. At the end of this novel Gatsby ended up loosing but he turned out as a pretty good guy because he took the blame for Daisy. Daisy and Tom ended up winning because at the end they still had money, they were still Rich, and they didn't care about anyone around them, because both of them were ignorant. What I though about this book was that it was a good book I really liked it because I found it interesting,and it also tough me something, it tough me that you should not try to impress other people, you should not lie about your life or background. The Great Gatsby can relate to our society as well because their is a lot of dishonesty and Adultery going around. I would Recommend this book because it is interesting and anyone would enjoy reading this book, and it would also leave you thinking about the real meaning of the Great Gatsby. "
1499,Collin,"I didn't particularly appreciate this book the first time I read it, in high school for a class. However, when I reread it a couple of years back I absolutely loved it.update: re-read it again and still love it. Here are some additional thoughts that I e-mailed to Kristina about it:""The funny thing is, even thinking to myself beforehand that I had to pay special attention to the colors, I still read right over virtually all of them without noticing (for example, the fact that daisies are a white flower? Yeah, I somehow failed to realize that). So while I'm sure that the color symbolism is intentional, I'm not convinced that it's essential. I mean, if you changed or removed every single color reference, would it reduce the impact or forcefulness of the story? I don't think it would....For me the tragedy of the book is that what happens to Gatsby/Daisy/Tom totally destroys the burgeoning relationship between [the narrator:] Nick and Jordan Baker. I strongly identify with Nick (he's got that great line near the beginning, ""Everybody suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people I have ever met."" That's exactly how I view myself), so that failure was more heartbreaking to me than the rest. Sad."""

1501,Laurel-Rain,"It was a golden era for some, the 1920s. And for a privileged few who enjoyed the lavish parties thrown by Jay Gatsby, it was a time of decadence, vibrancy, and texture.But who was Jay Gatsby? Did anyone know? And how were all these hangers-on connected to him?""The Great Gatsby"" is a story narrated by Nick Carraway, who lived next door to Gatsby in a modest home, and who was a second cousin to Daisy Buchanan, who lived across the water with her husband Tom. Some would say that Gatsby had purchased his home directly across from theirs for a specific reason.The story spans a short time in that Long Island summer season, with all the frivolity of blissful partying. But this season would be very different. Tragedy would conclude it, and the masses would disperse, almost as if none of them had even connected.And Nick would be left to piece together the tattered world left by those same oblivious masses: especially the careless Buchanans.This was my first read of the novel, although I have seen one movie based on the story. I am glad I read this, if only to experience firsthand the author's lyrical prose that digs deep and conveys so much about the glittering world populated by these dazzling and superficial characters. This one definitely is a five star read. "
1502,Sarah Baum,"Phenomenal. Forget the plot. The words themselves are what make this book great--put together so beautifully, imaginatively, and hauntingly by F Scott Fitzgerald. This book is truly the work of a gifted man. A random excerpt to illustrate my point: ""...he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about..."" Truly genius word craft. As an aspiring writer, I loved it. "
1503,Menna Kh.,"So, is Gatsby really GREAT? Is he even Gatsby?Ironically, Fitzgerald start screwing your mind by first reading the title, as he makes you wonder two things; Who is this Gatsby? and what makes him Great?You can see why he is great. He is the next-door celebrity who girls wish to be invited to one of his super extravagant parties with all the celebrities invited along with rich men from around the states.Gatsby is a man who had a tough time during his youth.. or went to Oxford?Jay Gatsby is the wealthiest man in his entourage by his family's wealth.. or by his own effort?The most important thing in this book that it is a total representative of its era.. before and after the WW1, and how American youth strove to achieve themselves, whether by money, fame, or even love.F. Scott Fitzgerald had many titles in his mind before ""THE Great Gatsby"" including ""The High-Bouncing Lover"". So is he truly a lover? And how was the fall of his ""High-Bouncing"".Is Daisy really the love of his life, or is she the only way through which that he can prove himself the sense of belonging to the aristocrats and the upper class.Gatsby pursued his dream, followed the 'green-light', representing his dream, his future.. But really, has pursuing his dream lead him to a better future, or actually to point zero?This book might be allegorical to America and the war itself, maybe the whole fuss of the war wasn't worth it, and all they got was separation, destruction, and even.. Death.The Great Gatsby is really my cup of coffee. Its symbolic, allegorical, historic and a total representative of its time. I love Jay Gatsby, I really do. I can't wait to see Leo DiCap as Gatsby too!"
1504,Jon Boorstin,"This is one of my models for writing fiction. It is just long enough to count as a novel. It's so compressed, but so wide-reaching. When it first came out, it was dismissed as melodrama. Today it sells more in a year than it did the whole time Fitzgerald was alive. It is melodrama, but that is just the armature. Fitzgerald manages to portray a vision of America, of our yearning, our soaring aspirations and our crippling limitations. It applies perfectly today."
1505,Jacquelyn,"Still amazing, eighteen years after reading it for the first time. This time, though, I feel like I finally understand Daisy. She wasn't always careless, but her desperation makes her so. And of course she doesn't leave Tom for Gatsby, she realizes it would be a lateral move, so how on earth could she benefit? She turns her back on Gatsby's mansion, toward the modest house Nick rents, and says she wants to run away from this life. Gatsby says, Oh, no, actually, you would live here and be my wife. In that moment, Daisy begins to see the bay as a mirror. East Egg, West Egg, they're identical. So what's the difference? Tom didn't marry her for status or money, he already had both, that's how he can get away with cheating: he doesn't have to worry about losing either if Daisy ever leaves. Meanwhile, part of Gatsby's plan of Ambition is Daisy and her status. Nick says he did it all for her, but that's not true. Gatsby's always wanted the kind of life that Daisy had, and worked hard to get that, not her. She became part of the plan and he was never able to let go of it. He loves her, but his obsession with status won't let him be what she needs, who she fell in love with years ago. He can't let go of everything he acquired for her to love him for her to stay with him. And, in the end, he pushes her too far, forces her to choose, and since he's not the man she fell in love with, and she would be only trapped as a trophy wife again, of course she stays with Tom, who has no ulterior motives for marrying her. In this way, the tragic character is Daisy, whose choices echo, in a way, those of Edna Pointellier in ""The Awakening"". When Edna realizes there's no place in society for the choices she wants to make, she chooses to leave it all. Daisy, realizing both choices are the same, decides to play the fool she wishes her daughter to become. And this would make Nick the main character, not Gatsby. Rather, the lens through which Nick sees Gatsby, since we know he's an unreliable narrator. Even though Gatsby is elevated as the paragon of the Jazz Age, its carelessness and excess, desperation, and loss of innocence, it's the subjective view of him, through Nick, that says more than Gatsby's blindness and hope. Nick, who calls himself one of the few honest people he knows, but strings along an all-but-abandoned girlfriend in the Midwest; who, instead of pursuing a life of his own, chooses a passive voyeurism of his acquaintances most likely to burn. What else could he have expected, agreeing to host Gatsby's and Daisy's first meeting at his house, besides fireworks? How can he possibly exempt himself from the group of people he calls careless and blames for Gatsby's fall? It's through Nick that we understand what we couldn't without him: he tells us, gently and indirectly, about Gatsby's denial and delusions while leaving unsaid his own denial that he has any delusions, because if he told us about his flaws any louder or clearer, he might begin to see his own. If Gatsby were anything less than Great, it would mean that we are, too. Instead, we'll drown it in jazz and electricity and gin rickeys and sex and lots and lots of money, and toast to the man Jay Gatsby should have been, if people unlike you and I had only been content with what they had, and never tried to reach for things so obviously beyond their grasp. Cheers. "
1506,Italo  Perazzoli,"This novel has no borders, it is a classical example of the possibility of a multitude of readings and meanings made by the same person but in different mental state and periods.After having read it for the first time, I thought to a poem of Walt Whitman, e.g. ""Leaves of Grass"" the refusal of the western world in favor of the eastern world.I watched the movie and for the first time I appreciated the director interpretations.The life of Gatsby is the emblem of the western society, in order to be considered and appreciated by the society we must appear, the image of ourselves is fundamental, we must be a synonymous of a dream with human appearance, but the reality is different.In conclusion thanks to this novel we can dream a different world during our reading."
1507,Mariana,"Πρέπει να ήμουν 13 ή 14 χρονών όταν για πρώτη φορά διάβασα τον Υπέροχο Γκάτσμπυ του Φιτζέραλντ κι αν δεν κάνω λάθος πρέπει να είναι ένα από τα πρώτα βιβλία που διάβασα και που ανήκουν στην παγκόσμια κλασσική λογοτεχνία. Και παρόλο που ήμουν μικρή και εκείνη την περίοδο δεν με ενδιέφεραν πολύ υποθέσεις που είχαν να κάνουν με ανεκπλήρωτους έρωτες ούτε είχα πολλές γνώσεις για την περίοδο με την οποία ασχολείται μου άρεσε τόσο πολύ που για μέρες μιλούσα για αυτό στις φίλες μου και στις μητέρες τους τόσο που κάποιες από ένα σημείο και μετά μου έλεγαν να σταματήσω να τους μιλώ για τον Gatsby και την άτυχη ζωή του. Ο Gatsby είναι ένας αγαπημένος λογοτεχνικός ήρωας από εκείνους που μπήκαν στην καρδιά μου την κατέκτησαν και δεν θα φύγουν ποτέ!! Τότε στα 13/14 μου πιο πολύ με είχε αγγίξει η τόσο μεγάλη αγάπη που είχε για μια γυναίκα και το πόσο τραγική ήταν η ζωή του. Είχα στεναχωρηθεί πάρα πολύ με το τέλος απ’ την άλλη όμως θεωρούσα πως αυτό ήταν το καλύτερο που θα μπορούσε να του συμβεί αφού έτσι ηρέμησε μια για πάντα η ψυχούλα του. Το βιβλίο του Φιτζέραλντ έγινε από τότε ένα από τα αγαπημένα μου και νομίζω πως εξαιτίας του και εξαιτίας των βιβλίων των Βερν στράφηκα στην ξένη λογοτεχνία. Μέχρι τότε διάβαζα περισσότερο Έλληνες συγγραφείς ξέρετε με αυτούς που μεγαλώνουν τα περισσότερα Ελληνόπουλα Ζωρζ Σαρρή, Άλκη Ζέη, Πηνελόπη Δέλτα, Μενέλαος Λουντέμης, Ηλίας Βενέζης, κτλ κτλ -.Τον Καζαντζάκη τον γνώρισα σε μεγαλύτερη ηλικία εγώ προσωπικά-.Τον Gatsby μέχρι σήμερα που είμαι 20 χρονών τον είχα διαβάσει τρεις φορές-μιλάμε για μεγάλο κόλλημα που συνεχίζεται-αλλά όσο κι αν ακούγεται παράξενο δεν είχα δει καμία από τις κινηματογραφικές μεταφορές του ούτε είχα ασχοληθεί με τη ζωή του συγγραφέα γενικότερα. Επίσης δεν έχω διαβάσει κάτι άλλο από τον Φιτζέραλντ κάτι που σύντομα δεν θα ισχύει αφού ήδη στο ράφι με τα αδιάβαστα βρίσκεται η Σκοτεινή Νύχτα που πρόσφατα κυκλοφόρησε από τις εκδόσεις Μεταίχμιο. Αυτή τη χρονιά στους κινηματογράφους βγήκε μια ακόμα ταινία βασισμένη στο βιβλίο με πρωταγωνιστές τους Leonardo DiCaprio, Carrey Mulligan,Joel Edgerton και οι φίλες μου ήθελαν να πάμε να τη δούμε. Αποφάσισα πως είχε φτάσει πια ο καιρός να δω ένα από τα πλέον αγαπημένα μου βιβλία στην μεγάλη οθόνη. Ήλπιζα η μεταφορά να είναι καλή και σωστή και να σέβεται την ιστορία. Ευτυχώς τα πάντα πήγαν καλά και δεν απογοητεύτηκα. Όμως πριν πάω να τη δω αποφάσισα να διαβάσω για τέταρτη φορά το βιβλίο όχι τόσο για να θυμηθώ την ιστορία-πλέον κάποιους διαλόγους τους ξέρω απ’ έξω!-αλλά γιατί έχω τη συνήθεια ταινίες που στηρίζονται σε βιβλία τα οποία κυκλοφορούν στα Ελληνικά πριν τις δω να τα έχω διαβάσει. Επιπλέον ήθελα να δω αν το βιβλίο θα με συγκινήσει και θα με αγγίξει τόσο όσο με άγγιξε τις προηγούμενες τρεις φορές κι αν ακόμα ανήκει στη λίστα με τα αγαπημένα μου. Και τελικά συνειδητοποίησα ότι όχι μόνο ανήκει αλλά βρίσκεται και στις πρώτες θέσεις. Δεν λέω ή ταινία ήταν αρκετά καλή και ιδιαίτερα φροντισμένη αλλά σαν το βιβλίο δεν ήταν!! Τα συναισθήματα που μου προκαλεί η γραφή του Φιτζέραλντ δεν μου τα προκάλεσε η ταινία. Ο DiCaprio ήταν αρκετά καλός ως Gatsby αλλά δεν έφτασε εκείνον του βιβλίου που για πρώτη φορά φαντάστηκα στα 13 μου και όποτε το διαβάζω με επισκέπτεται και είναι μαζί μου από την πρώτη μέχρι την τελευταία του σελίδα…Νέα Υόρκη 1922..ο Νικ Καράγουει καταφτάνει στην πόλη έχοντας πολλά όνειρα για μια καλύτερη ζωή και δουλειά. Κατάγεται από οικογένεια πλουσίων αλλά θέλει μόνος του να τα καταφέρει στη ζωή. Έτσι λοιπόν νοικιάζει ένα σπίτι στο West Egg και αρχίζει τη νέα του ζωή. Στην πόλη μένει και μια ξαδέρφη του η Νταίζη μαζί με τον άντρα της τον Τομ μόνο που αυτοί μένουν στην απέναντι πλευρά σε εκείνη των καθαρόαιμων πλουσίων στο East Egg. Ο Νικ τους επισκέπτεται ένα απόγευμα γνωρίζει τη φίλη τους τη Τζόρνταν και βλέπει το πόσο επιφανειακά ζουν και πόσο σάπια είναι η σχέση τους. Ο Τομ έχει φιλενάδα κάτι που η Νταίζη γνωρίζει αλλά κάνει τα στραβά μάτια ενώ εκείνος δεν έχει σκοπό να την αφήσει. Ο Νικ έχει έναν παράξενο γείτονα κάποιον που κάθε βράδυ διοργανώνει απίστευτα πάρτι στα οποία πάνε όλοι οι πλούσιοι της χώρας κι όμως οι περισσότεροι από αυτούς δεν γνωρίζουν τον οικοδεσπότη ούτε ξέρουν τί ακριβώς κάνει και έχει τόση μεγάλη περιουσία. Το όνομα του παράξενου και μυστηριώδη γείτονά του είναι Gatsby και κάποια μέρα ο Νικ λαμβάνει μια πρόσκληση με την οποία εκείνος τον καλεί στο επόμενο πάρτι του. Και ο Νικ αποφασίζει να πάει αφού θέλει να τον γνωρίσει από κοντά. Και το κάνει. Εκεί θα συναντήσει την Τζόρνταν αλλά δεν θα καταφέρει να πλησιάσει τον Gatsby μέχρι που κάποια στιγμή θα πιάσει κουβέντα με έναν άγνωστο άντρα δίπλα του περίπου στην ηλικία του και θα αρχίσει να του μιλά για τον οικοδεσπότη μέχρι που θα συνειδητοποιήσει ότι αυτός που έχει απέναντί του είναι ο περίφημος Gatsby!! Από εκείνη τη στιγμή οι δύο αυτοί άντρες θα έρθουν κοντά και μια περίεργη φιλία θα δημιουργηθεί ανάμεσα τους. Μια σχέση που θα κρατήσει ένα ολόκληρο καλοκαίρι και που θα διακοπεί άδοξα και άδικα από ένα παράξενο παιχνίδι της μοίρας. Ο Νικ θα γνωρίσει τον αληθινό Gatsby εκείνον που διοργανώνει αυτά τα πάρτι όχι γιατί θέλει να δείξει τον πλούτο του ή να κάνει φίλους αλλά επειδή περιμένει να δει σε αυτά ένα συγκεκριμένο πρόσωπο. Ένα πρόσωπο που όμως δεν λέει να εμφανιστεί.. πρόκειται για την Νταίζη την ξαδέρφη του Νικ τη μεγάλη αγάπη του Gatsby αυτή για την οποία θα έκανε τα πάντα!! Ο Νικ μαθαίνει την πραγματική ιστορία του και το πως γνώρισε ερωτεύτηκε και χώρισε μαζί της συγκινείται και αποφασίζει να τον βοηθήσει και τον φέρνει σε επαφή μαζί της. Ο Gatsby πετά από τη χαρά του όταν ξαναβλέπει την αγαπημένη του αλλά το όνειρο διαρκεί για λίγο αφού ο Τομ καταστρέφει τα πάντα. Βέβαια δεν είναι μόνο ο Τομ αυτός που δεν αφήνει το όνειρο να πραγματοποιηθεί. Ο Gatsby ονειρεύεται μια ζωή με τη Νταίζη εκείνη όμως??? Ο Gatsby μέσα από τη συμπεριφορά του και το χαρακτήρα του γίνεται στα μάτια μας υπέροχος ξεχωριστός ιδεαλιστής… η αγαπημένη του όμως?? του μοιάζει καθόλου? ή για εκείνη πλέον οι προτεραιότητες είναι διαφορετικές??.. Νέα Υόρκη 1924 ο Νικ Καράγουει αποφασίζει να διηγηθεί την ιστορία του Gatsby την γνωριμία του μαζί του και τα όσα συνέβησαν εκείνο το καλοκαίρι που τον σημάδεψαν για πάντα. Αποφασίζει να διηγηθεί την ιστορία ενός υπέροχου ανθρώπου την εποχή της τζαζ και του αμερικανικού ονείρου που δυστυχώς για εκείνον έμεινε απλώς άπιαστο όνειρο αλλά στα μάτια του ο Gatsby παραμένει απλά.. υπέροχος!!!!''Έχω σκοπό να γράψω κάτι καινούριο ,κάτι εξαιρετικό και πολύπλοκο κάτι όμορφο και απλό''.. αυτά ήταν τα λόγια του Φιτζέραλντ στον εκδότη του το 1923 όταν αποφάσισε να γράψει το βιβλίο αυτό. Και νομίζω ότι δεν υπάρχουν καλύτερα λόγια για να το περιγράψεις. Ο δημιουργός του σε μια μόνο γραμμή είπε τα πάντα.. ο Gatsby ήταν για την εποχή του κάτι καινούριο, κάτι εξαιρετικό, πολύπλοκο, όμορφο και απλό. Ναι όλα αυτά μπορεί να τα βρει κανείς στις 227 σελίδες του-243 έχει το βιβλίο αλλά η ιστορία ολοκληρώνεται στη σελίδα 227 οι τελευταίες αφορούν την πολύπλοκη και πολυτάραχη ζωή του συγγραφέα-.Το βιβλίο κυκλοφόρησε το 1925 και οι κριτικές ήταν ανάμεικτες. Άλλοι είδαν σε αυτό ένα κείμενο διαφορετικό από αυτά που κυκλοφορούσαν εκείνη την εποχή ενώ κάποιοι άλλοι λίγο πολύ το χαρακτήρισαν σκουπίδι και από τα χειρότερα βιβλία του συγγραφέα. Την καλύτερη απάντηση πάντως στις κριτικές την έδωσε ο εκδότης του Φιτζέραλντ ‘’Για ένα πράγμα μπορούμε να είμαστε σίγουροι, όταν οι φωνές και ο συμφερτός των κριτικών και των κουτσομπόληδων ξεθυμάνουν ο Υπέροχος Γκάτσμπυ θα ξεχωρίσει ως ένα εξαιρετικό βιβλίο’’. Και είχε δίκιο. Τα λόγια του πλέον μπορεί να χαρακτηριστούν και ως προφητικά. Όταν πρωτοκυκλοφόρησε δεν είχε μεγάλη επιτυχία αυτή ήρθε μετά το θάνατο του συγγραφέα και γενικά ο Φιτζέραλντ ανήκει σε εκείνους τους συγγραφείς που δικαιώθηκαν και έγιναν γνωστοί μετά θάνατο. Πολύ λυπάμαι όταν διαβάζω βιογραφίες συγγραφέων και βλέπω ότι η δικαίωση ήρθε αφού εκείνοι είχαν αφήσει αυτό τον κόσμο. Ο Φιτζέραλντ είχε μια πολυτάραχη ζωή δεν έζησε πολύ αλλά όσο έζησε το έκανε με πάθος. Δυο τρεις γυναίκες σημάδεψαν τη ζωή του και μάλιστα αυτό αποτυπώνεται και στα έργα του. Αν κάποιος μελετήσει τη βιογραφία του και μετά τα βιβλία του θα δει αρκετά αυτοβιογραφικά στοιχεία και κάποιοι ήρωες του μοιάζουν με τον συγγραφέα. Κάτι τέτοιο φαίνεται να συμβαίνει και εδώ αφού ο Gatsby μοιάζει σε πολλά με τον Φιτζέραλντ. Ο Gatsby ήταν φτωχός και ερωτεύτηκε μια πλούσια που όμως δεν μπόρεσε να την παντρευτεί αφού δεν ανήκε στη δική της τάξη. Εκείνη τον άφησε παντρεύτηκε κάποιον της τάξης της τα χρόνια πέρασαν και ξανασυναντήθηκαν ως δύο πλούσιοι. Μόνο που και πάλι δεν ανήκαν στην ίδια κοινωνική τάξη. Απ’ την άλλη τα νεανικά χρόνια του Φιτζέραλντ σημαδεύτηκαν από την Τζινίβρα Κινγκ μια πλούσια δεσποινίδα η οποία σαν άλλη Νταίζη τον εγκατέλειψε επειδή ήταν φτωχός!! Κάτι που ο συγγραφέας δεν μπόρεσε ποτέ του να ξεπεράσει και όποτε έβρισκε ευκαιρία το ανέφερε στα έργα του και γενικότερα ασχολιόταν με τις διάφορες κοινωνικές τάξεις και το πως μπορεί να καταστρέψουν τις ζωές των ανθρώπων. Την συγκεκριμένη γυναίκα νομίζω πως δεν την ξεπέρασε ποτέ του αργότερα παντρεύτηκε έκανε παιδιά αγάπησε αλλά και πάλι το παρελθόν του τον κυνηγούσε μέχρι το τέλος της ζωής του. Επίσης η σκηνή που ο Γουίλσον κλειδώνει την Μιρτλ στο σπίτι για να μην του φύγει θυμίζει αυτό που έκανε ο ίδιος ο συγγραφέας στην γυναίκα του τη Ζέλντα όταν εκείνη είχε ερωτευθεί κάποιον άλλο και ήθελε να τον χωρίσει!! Βέβαια το πιο τραγικό από όλα είναι ότι το τέλος του Gatsby θυμίζει το τέλος του συγγραφέα. Ο Gatsby στην κηδεία του δεν είχε σχεδόν κανέναν μόνο τον Νικ και τον πατέρα του. Κανένας άλλος δεν πήγε να τον αποχαιρετήσει ούτε η Νταίζη ούτε οι πλούσιοι που πήγαιναν στα πάρτι του. Το ίδιο μοναχική και απλή ήταν και η κηδεία του συγγραφέα. Είχε πολύ λίγο κόσμο η σύζυγός του δεν ήταν εκεί λόγω της εύθραυστης υγεία του η Σίλα η γυναίκα με την οποία έμενε τα τελευταία χρόνια δεν πήγε για λόγους ευπρέπειας και γενικά πολύ λίγα άτομα τον συνόδεψαν στην τελευταία του κατοικία.. Δεν ξέρω αλλά πραγματικά είναι σαν η μοίρα να του έπαιξε ένα παράξενο και τραγικό παιχνίδι και να τον έβαλε στη θέση του ηρώα του, του Gatsby …Τον τίτλο του το βιβλίο τον οφείλει στη γυναίκα του Φιτζέραλντ τη Ζέλντα. Εκείνος είχε στο μυαλό του τίτλους όπως Gatsby, Ο Gatsby με το χρυσό καπέλο, Τριμαλχίων... αλλά τελικά υπερίσχυσε η άποψη της συζύγου και πολύ καλά έκανε αφού ο ήρωας του βιβλίου είναι πραγματικά υπέροχος! Όταν κάποιος το διαβάσει για πρώτη φορά σίγουρα στα πρώτα τρία κεφάλαια του θα πει ‘’τί διαβάζω τώρα? που είναι ο ήρωας και τί ακριβώς γίνεται εδώ??’’ αλλά αν συνεχίσει και δεν το αφήσει πολύ σύντομα οι απορίες του θα λυθούν. Τα τρία πρώτα κεφάλαια δίνουν την εντύπωση του ασύνδετου, ότι κάτι δεν πάει καλά με την ιστορία. Δίνουν διάφορες πληροφορίες για διάφορους χαρακτήρες αλλά δεν μπορείς να καταλάβεις που κολλάνε όλοι αυτοί με τον Gatsby Ο οποίος κάνει την εμφάνισή του στο τρίτο κεφάλαιο μόνο που είναι αρκετά μικρή και γενικά ο χαρακτήρας του σε προβληματίζει αρκετά ενώ είναι φανερό ότι κάτι κρύβει. Κι όμως τα τρία πρώτα κεφάλαια αν και φαίνονται ασύνδετα δεν είναι. Μας παρουσιάζουν με πολύ καλό τρόπο τους βασικούς χαρακτήρες του βιβλίου αυτούς που παρακάτω θα καθορίσουν την ιστορία. Αφηγητής είναι ο Νικ Καραγουεί. Έχουν περάσει δύο χρόνια από το καλοκαίρι εκείνο του 1922 που γνώρισε τον Gatsby και νιώθει την ανάγκη να πει την ιστορία του να μας τον γνωρίσει. Στο πρώτο κεφάλαιο γνωρίζουμε τον Νικ και την οικογένειά του και φυσικά την ξαδέρφη του τη Νταίζη και τον άντρα της τον Τόμ. Βλέπουμε την επιφανειακή, πλούσια, σάπια ζωή που ζουν, ένα ζευγάρι που στα μάτια των άλλων είναι ευτυχισμένο αλλά στην πραγματικότητα ο Τομ απατά τη Νταίζη εκείνη το ξέρει αλλά κανένας τους δεν θέλει να χωρίσει. Είναι δύο δυστυχισμένοι άνθρωποι σε έναν δυστυχισμένο γάμο αλλά έχουν συμβιβαστεί με αυτό και κατά κάποιο τρόπο τους αρέσει. Στο δεύτερο κεφάλαιο γνωρίζουμε την κρυφή ζωή του Τομ την ερωμένη του που καμία σχέση δεν έχει με τη Νταίζη και τον άντρα της που την υπεραγαπά αλλά έχει μαύρα μεσάνυκτα όσον αφορά τη ζωή της συζύγου του. Ο Τομ και εκείνη τον κοροϊδεύουν μπροστά στα μάτια του και εκείνος δεν το βλέπει. Και όταν θα ξυπνήσει άλλος θα την πληρώσει και άδικα μάλιστα. Στο τρίτο κεφάλαιο είναι η σειρά του Gatsby. Ο Νικ πάει σε ένα από τα περίφημα πάρτι του και εκεί που έχει απελπιστεί και νομίζει πως δεν θα τον γνωρίσει εκείνος τον πλησιάζει και αυτό ήταν.. Ο Gatsby στο πρόσωπο του Νικ βρίσκει έναν φίλο και έναν σύμμαχο και ο Νικ βρίσκει έναν αληθινό άνθρωπο και μη υποκριτή. Και η ιστορία ξεκινά.. ο ρυθμός της είναι καταιγιστικός σε κάθε κεφάλαιο συμβαίνουν ένα σωρό πράγματα με αποκορύφωμα το προτελευταίο κεφάλαιο που είναι συγκλονιστικό από την αρχή μέχρι το τέλος! Για να ακολουθήσει ένα τελευταίο κεφάλαιο αρκετά λυπητερό και ρεαλιστικό συνάμα.. Ο Φιτζέραλντ ξέρει να γράφει, ξέρει να χρησιμοποιεί σωστά τις λέξεις έτσι ώστε να κερδίσει το ενδιαφέρον και την προσοχή του αναγνώστη. Είναι υπέροχος στις περιγραφές. Οι λέξεις του σε παρασύρουν σε άλλους κόσμους και εποχές. Στο τρίτο κεφάλαιο που περιγράφει το πάρτι οι περιγραφές του είναι τόσο αληθινές και ζωντανές που είναι σαν να ακούς τη μουσική και να βλέπεις τους ανθρώπους να χορεύουν γύρω σου. Είναι από εκείνους τους συγγραφείς που έχουν την ικανότητα να δημιουργούν στο μυαλό των αναγνωστών εικόνες τόσο ζωντανές που αν απλώσεις το χέρι νιώθεις πως θα τις αγγίξεις. Αυτό το συναίσθημα το νιώθω κάθε φορά που διαβάζω τον Gatsby οι εικόνες του βιβλίου εμφανίζονται μπροστά μου ολοζώντανες.. βλέπω το πάρτι, την συνάντηση στο ξενοδοχείο, το θάνατο του Gatsby το ατύχημα της Μάρτζ.. και κάθε φορά προσπαθώ να αποφασίσω ποιό είναι το αγαπημένο μου κεφάλαιο και δεν μπορώ! Μου αρέσουν όλα! Δεν μπορώ να διαλέξω.. έχω βέβαια μια μικρή αδυναμία στο προτελευταίο κεφάλαιο και στο πως ο ήρωας οδηγείται στο θάνατο και εκπλήσσομαι και εγώ με αυτό γιατί κανονικά δεν θα έπρεπε να αγαπώ ένα τέτοιο κεφάλαιο. Αλλά είναι τόσο μαγικός ο τρόπος που ο συγγραφέας περιγράφει την τελευταία μέρα του Gatsby και τόσο συγκλονιστικός ο θάνατος του ανθρώπου γεμάτος συναισθήματα λύπης και ανακούφισης παράλληλα γιατί ηρέμησε επιτέλους η ψυχούλα του που δεν μπορώ παρά να πω πως είναι ένα κεφάλαιο αγαπημένο και αξέχαστο…Δύο κόσμοι αντιπαραβάλλονται σε αυτό το βιβλίο. Εκείνος των πλουσίων από πάππου προς πάππου στον οποίο ανήκει η Νταίζη, ο Τομ, ο Νικ και όλοι οι πλούσιοι που πάνε στα πάρτι του Gatsby και εκείνος των νεόπλουτων της Αμερικής της δεκαετίας του 1920 που πίστευαν ότι τα λεφτά θα τους άνοιγαν όλες τις πόρτες. Ακόμα και εκείνες της καλής κοινωνίας. Σε αυτό τον κόσμο ανήκει ο Gatsby. Πρώην φτωχός και αξιωματικός του στρατού γνώρισε την Νταίζη σε μια εποχή που και εκείνη έκανε όνειρα και πίστευε στην αγάπη και στον έρωτα αλλά οι διαφορετικές κοινωνικές τους τάξεις, το ότι εκείνη ήταν πλούσια ενώ εκείνος φτωχός τους χώρισε. Εκείνος έφυγε στον πόλεμο εκείνη παντρεύτηκε τον Τόμ και γρήγορα ξέχασε τον αξιωματικό και τον έρωτα. Αγάπησε τον άντρα της με τον τρόπο της και συμβιβάστηκε στην πλούσια ζωή της. Ζούσε για να ζει, ζούσε απολαμβάνοντας τα πάντα γιατί πίστευε ότι της ανήκαν ότι είχε το δικαίωμα να τα απολαύσει. Ήξερε για τον άντρα της και την ερωμένη του αλλά δεν τον χώριζε. Ο Τομ πάλι ήταν ένας σάπιος πλούσιος, ρατσιστής μέχρι το κόκαλο που νόμιζε ότι επειδή γεννήθηκε πλούσιος και με λεφτά είναι ανώτερος από τους άλλους και καλύτερός τους. Αγαπά τη Νταίζη αλλά έχει και την ερωμένη για να του καλύπτει τις ανάγκες που η γυναίκα του δεν μπορεί. Τη Νταίζη τη θεωρεί δεδομένη μέχρι που εμφανίζεται ο Gatsby. Και τότε ο Τόμ γίνεται φίδι και τρέχει να σώσει το γάμο του προσβάλλοντας και υποτιμώντας τον Gatsby και τα πλούτη του αλλά λέγοντας και αλήθειες παράλληλα για τη γυναίκα του. Ο Gatsby είναι πλούσιος αλλά δεν ανήκει στην τάξη τους. Όσα λεφτά κι αν αποκτήσει ποτέ του δεν θα αποκτήσει τη Νταίζη γιατί το να γίνεις πλούσιος δεν είναι το ίδιο με το να είσαι πλούσιος! Και δυστυχώς το ίδιο πιστεύει πλέον και η Νταίζη η οποία διασκεδάζει λίγο με τον πρώην αγαπημένο της αλλά δεν τολμά να κάνει το βήμα και να αφήσει τον Νικ. Όχι αυτή είναι μια πριγκιποπούλα δεν θα πάει με κάποιον που δεν ανήκει στην τάξη της. Και ο Gatsby το διαπιστώνει αυτό με τον χειρότερο δυνατό τρόπο.. Ο ήρωας είναι αυτός που ενσαρκώνει το Αμερικανικό όνειρο της δεκαετίας εκείνη που ήταν μια εποχή θαυμάτων, αναζήτησης ελπίδων, υπερβολών, μια εποχή αφθονίας μια εποχή αντιθέσεων. Ήταν η εποχή της ποτοαπαγόρευσης και του άφθονου αλκοόλ ταυτόχρονα. Πολλοί έγιναν εκατομμυριούχοι διακινώντας λαθραία αλκοόλ κάτι τέτοιο έκανε και ο Gatsby. Ο ήρωας μας είναι κολλημένος στην εικόνα της Νταίζης και στα φιλιά τους και αν και τα χρόνια έχουν περάσει και ξέρει πως εκείνη έχει παντρευτεί και έχει και παιδί εκείνος δεν μπορεί να την ξεχάσει. Και όχι μόνο αυτό αλλά πιστεύει πως αν πλουτίσει με τον οποιοδήποτε τρόπο αν αποκτήσει όσα λεφτά έχει και εκείνη τότε εκείνη θα γίνει δική του αφού αυτό που τους χώρισε ήταν τα λεφτά! Ονειρεύεται μια κοινή ζωή με τη Νταίζη μια ζωή ευτυχίας και έρωτα. Πιστεύει στο όνειρό του και για αυτό πάλεψε όλα αυτά τα χρόνια. Ποτέ του δεν έχασε την ελπίδα πάντα πίστευε ότι θα τα κατάφερνε. Κυνηγούσε με όλες του τις δυνάμεις το όνειρό του και δεν είδε ότι ήταν άπιαστο!! Η Νταίζη και ο Gatsby δεν θα μπορούσαν ποτέ να είναι μαζί όπως κυνικά και απάνθρωπα του λέει ο Τόμ αφού εκείνος δεν είναι σαν αυτούς. Δεν ανήκει στην τάξη τους και ποτέ δεν θα μπει σε αυτή.. οι πλούσιοι που πήγαιναν στα πάρτι του και μίλαγαν μαζί του χαμογελούσαν δίπλα του έβγαιναν φωτογραφίες έπιναν από τα ποτά του εκμεταλλεύονταν τη φιλοξενία του του γύρισαν την πλάτη στην πιο δύσκολη στιγμή του και κανείς από όλους αυτούς δεν πήγε στην κηδεία του! Κανείς δεν τον τίμησε με την παρουσία του.. η Νταίζη σηκώθηκε και έφυγε με τον άντρα της και όλοι οι άλλοι τον ξέχασαν πολύ εύκολα.. Ο Gatsby είναι ένας άντρας που παλεύει για το όνειρό του που μέχρι την τελευταία στιγμή ελπίζει παρόλο που κατά βάθος ξέρει ότι τα πάντα έχουν τελειώσει.. είναι υπέροχος.''Όπως καθόμουν εκεί και αναπολούσα τον παλιό άγνωστο κόσμο, σκέφτηκα το δέος που ένιωσε ο Gatsby όταν είδε για πρώτη φορά το πράσινο φως στην άκρη της αποβάθρας τη Ντέιζι. Είχε διανύσει πολύ δρόμο για να φτάσει σ’ αυτό τον κυανό μπαξέ και θα πρέπει να του φαινόταν τόσο κοντινό το όνειρό του που λίγο έλειπε για να το αδράξει. Δεν ήξερε ότι ήταν πίσω του, χαμένο κάπου στην απέραντη αφάνεια πέρα από την πόλη, εκεί που οι σκοτεινές εκτάσεις της ώρας ξετυλίγονται κάτω από τη νύχτα''.. Δεν νομίζω ότι υπάρχει καλύτερος τρόπος να τελειώσω αυτό το κείμενο από τα λόγια του Νικ που τόσο εύστοχα περιγράφουν το απατηλό όνειρό του Gatsby και πού αυτός ο υπέροχος άνθρωπος έκανε λάθος. Δεν έχω να πω τίποτε άλλο παρά μόνο ότι το βιβλίο αυτό πρέπει να υπάρχει στη βιβλιοθήκη κάθε σπιτιού!! Μέσα από την ιστορία αγάπης το ανεκπλήρωτο όνειρό του Gatsby τις μαγευτικές περιγραφές του Φιτζέραλντ και τη δυναμική του γλώσσα και γραφή ο αναγνώστης θα ταξιδέψει σε έναν κόσμο μαγικό αλλά και επικίνδυνο ταυτόχρονα έναν κόσμο που επιτρέπει τα πάντα αλλά που μπορεί να σου τα αφαιρέσει όλα στη στιγμή.. Ο Gatsby για μένα ήταν είναι και θα είναι ένα υπέροχο ταξίδι!!"
1508,Hamid Raza,"This is a marvelous look into the green-eyed monster of sexual jealousy. It's ripe with symbolic imagery from Fitzgerald's personal agony over his wife adulterous affair.Everyone knows the superficial lit class interpretation of the novel; idealistic Gatsby pursues fortune in vain attempt to dazzle and win golden girl, only to have her reject him. Conclusion: classic condemnation of the hollowness of upper class materialism. Rubbish!No matter what, I LOVE this book and Loved the movie even more. It's so rare that we see words put into real live action SO good that they would blow your mind and make you memorize them FOREVER! Amazing movie and great book! "
1509,Gregory Conway,"Did you know that Hunter S. Thompson used to rewrite out The Great Gatsby over and over again to get used to the beauty of a sentance and to learn proper grammar? This time-consuming work ended up making Thompson lose his job, and possibly his mind... Or it could've been all the drugs...****It's actually neat to look at the comparisons between the two novels, this and  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas . 1) They both search for the American Dream.2) The main characters both realize the American Dream is a lie.3) Similar grammar and dialogue styles.4) They're both in your face novels.I know what you're thinking, how is The Great Gatsby in your face? Look at Tom Buchanan, the worst human being since Stephen Harper. Ha! Depict the rich, high-end class as horrid creatures who lack morals. How in your face is that? I think F. Scott Fitzgerald has the right idea. Don't believe me? Go talk to a Western private school student and ask them what honour is. Go ask a corporate entity representative what morals and ethics are. To paraphrase a quote from a biography on Hunter S. Thompson...F. Scott Fitzgerald looked through a window to the rich society, saw the flaws and the atrocities, yet still wanted to be a part of it.Hunter S. Thompson looked through the window to the rich society, and wanted to throw a brick through the window and kill everyone inside.

1510,Living Belowtheclouds,"To me, the greatest love story that I ever read"
1511,Christopher Matthewson,"Soooooo good. I'm a sucker for Jazz and the 1920's. I'm almost sure that a Jazz Quintet accompanied me while I was reading this; either that or Fitzgeralds writing is as boisterous as I've been lead to believe..While the book is anything but succinct, it is an interesting critique of social class. The ingratiating pretension of Tom Buchanan, to the laconically charming Mr.Carraway, and their subsequent interactions gives this pervading paradigm some verisimilitude. Other than this, Fitzgerald captures the essence and grit of the Jazz heavy, fedora-clad, brooding, cigarette brandishing, bejewelled, post World War 1, 1920's America, to which the author was so intrepidly betrothed. Fitzgerald bequeaths a body of work that has ostensibly outlined a story that shuffles the reader into a comfortable state of blissful ambiguity. I'm glad I held out on watching the movie until I read the book. Unexpectedly sad in the end. Not much else to say about this book really. It's a classic for a reason. Go read it. "
1512,Macy," Can't repeat the Past? An American classic set in the 1920s, The Great Gatsby, is, at only about 180 pages, a simple, yet thought-provoking story that will stick in your mind. There are several discussion prompting themes featured in the novel. F. Scott Fitzgerald’s work will leave you contemplating the “American dream” and if Gatsby’s famous quote, ‘""Can't repeat the past?"" he cried incredulously. ""Why of course you can""’ (116) is true long after you’ve finished reading. It also highlights class issues and how they evolve. I could tell right from the start why this book is considered a great American classic. 	The story centers around the narrator, Nick Carraway’s experiences with his neighbor Jay Gatsby. The two become fast friends at one of the out of this world parties thrown at Gatsby’s mansion. They intertwine with Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom, which is when secrets from the past start to be uncovered.Personally, I felt the imagery in the writing was perfectly worded to make you feel as though you are right there experiencing every scene. From Gatsby’s extravagant parties to Daisy’s dining room, you travel through Long Island with the characters throughout the story. Fitzgerald writes about a hot summer day that will make you sweat just reading it. What surprised me was how simple the story actually is. If you’re looking for a comparison to the movie, the film was more of a feast for the eyes with an added storyline. "
1513,Caitlin,There might be something wrong with you if you don't like Fitzgerald's classic novel.
1514,Miss Karen Jean Martinson,"I don't really count audio books as reading, really. Or maybe I do, as I just bought three more audio books tonight. Anyhoo, I did read Gatsby once with my very own eyes, so up it goes on the goodreads shelf. Funny, the first time I read it, I didn't really like it because, much like Nick Caraway, by the end of the book I was so disgusted with Daisy and Tom that it made me forget all about the beautiful prose and want to just leave that world behind. Glad that I had an audio version - read beautifully by Tim Robbins - to listen to as I drove across the desert from LA to Phoenix. Not only because it passed the time and made the car trip MUCH more pleasant that it usually is, but also because I really was able to appreciate what a masterfully written book this is. Oh, F. Scott, I'm sorry I doubted you in the past, my fellow Minnesotan with such a noble Midwestern take on the world! What an enchanting and ultimately debased world you created so vibrantly for your readers! So many beautiful phrases and scenes. Owl Eyes in the library. The bizarre party in Myrtle's apartment. The Gatsby Saturday night fetes. Thank you Tim Robbins for reminding me of your immense talent."
1515,Caro,"I really liked this novel. This is only the fourth ""classic"" I've read, and they keep getting better and better. I look forward to reading more in-depth novels such as this in the near future."
1516,Jeffrey Bumiller,"I don't know exactly why I waited so long to read this book. If I went into details it would be tedious and boring, but I guess I had my reasons. Having said that, this is the kind of book that makes me wonder what my life would be like if I read it 15 years ago, or 10 years ago, or 2 years ago, or 6 months ago, or 2 weeks ago. It's that kind of book: the kind you will never forget, probably never stop contemplating, it is a book by which all others that come after it will be measured. I will read all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books, I promise that. But I will always remember this one, my first. I will remember reading this tragic, beautiful, revealing novel, two weeks before my 33rd birthday, amidst such indecision, turmoil, and uncertainty. "
1517,Linette,"In this world there is no such thing as friends. Anyone who comes up to you, is someone who is looking for his own interest in befriending you. And this gives you the illusion that you are loved and respected by many friends, when really, it is just a false illusion. But then comes the time when you need those people who were always around you most, and no one shows up, because all they really care about is themselves. I loved the truth is comes to express straightforward."
1518,Bogdan,"I heard of The Great Gatsby as one of masterpieces of 20th century novel, but didn't manage to read it until now. And even now, it was because I received it as a present last Christmas. And I can only thank to my brother and sister-in-law for choosing this one, as it is indeed an excellent book. The premise is about one of the essential American myths: money bring happiness (or not). The story of Jay Gatsby is proving that money can buy many things, but the most important ones are usually requiring some other kind of currency. Fortunately, almost every other character from this novel has a story to tell, a message to transmit. This is in my opinion the beauty of this magnum opus: it deals with an entire generation. Thus my rating is 5 for premise.Regarding the form, I liked Scott Fitzgerald's writing style, even though the first person narration is not perfect. It is easy to read but also with sufficient meaning between the lines to keep entertained the academic reader. I will rate it with a 5 for form.In terms of originality, I did not come across too many books about the Roaring Twenties or The Lost Generation, but this was mainly because I was mostly interested in post World War II writers, that had other themes. But the overall focus on American way of life makes it to be part of the traditional American novel. So I will give it a 4 for the level of originality.The characters are carefully designed to capture as much as possible and entire generation. Of course it focuses on the rich, but Gatsby was born in a rich family and Wilson and his wife are also not part of the same elite. So I think it does a great job to portray interesting and vivid characters, thus I'll rate it with 5.Regarding the complexity and difficulty, it is obvious that the author took enough time to refine it and eliminate all that it was not necessary. Due to the numerous themes it also makes it quite complex, but without being inaccessible to the casual reader. Great combination! Thus, I will rate it then with a 5 for complexity and difficulty.In terms of credibility, I was almost able to feel as if the Long Island society lives next door to me and Jay, Tom and Daisy or Nick are my acquaintances. This is how lively he managed to create the atmosphere and the society of those years. So my rating for credibility is 5.The last criteria is edition. I liked this hardcover, elegant edition with a nice jacket and great paper. It was also sewn in such a way that it allowed me to read it on flat surfaces, even though it was not necessarily required as it is not a long book. My only issue was with the translation. I wish to find time to read it in original, as I felt I am missing something. Maybe I am wrong but I will rate it with a 4.To summarize, I enjoyed greatly this already classic masterpiece. All in all, my final rating for it is 4.71, which I will round it to 5 on Goodreads system.+--------------------------+-----------------+| Criteria | Rating |+--------------------------+-----------------+|Premise | 5 |+--------------------------+-----------------+|Form | 5 |+--------------------------+-----------------+|Originality | 4 |+--------------------------+-----------------+|Characters | 5 |+--------------------------+-----------------+|Difficulty/Complexity | 5 |+--------------------------+-----------------+|Credibility | 5 |+--------------------------+-----------------+|Edition | 4 |+--------------------------+-----------------+|Total | 4.71 |+--------------------------+-----------------+For more details on how I rated and reviewed this novel, please read these guidelines."
1519,Alexandra Vezure,"O carte care merită citită, fie că ați văzut sau nu filmul. Spumoasă, sclipitoare, plină de viață și foarte bine scrisă. America anilor 20, Jazz Age. Visul American, deziluzii, diferența de clase.. vise de iubire.""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--"" (V 18+)"
1520,Ema,"Gostei bastante, tem uma leitura agradável, embora me tenha perdido algumas vezes no ""diz que disse"". Inicialmente, não apreciei o Carraway como narrador, devido a achá-lo desenquadrado. No final, fiquei a perceber que ele estava mesmo desenquadrado, não em relação à narração nem ao Gatsby, mas sim ao próprio meio social onde tudo se desenvolve. Por isso, apenas simpatizei com estas duas personagens e as suas respectivas vivências, odiei a maioria das outras e fiquei feliz pelo facto de os seus destinos se terem distanciado."
1521,Cynthia Austin,"I love how perfectly the latest film adaption has matched this book. The descriptive nature of Daisy Buchanan is complex. She's this beautiful vixen who has the ability to make every man fall for her, simply by speaking with a voice as smooth and inciting as…money. She is gorgeous and is written to be this mysterious, southern belle, yet she seems shallow and despondent.In the movie, Gatsby seems like the most romantic man ever. In the book he’s a bit of a stalker. Then to find out the whole love affair between the two only lasted one month makes Gatsby seem even crazier. Why couldn’t he simply give this woman up? What was it about her that made him obsess over her so? She was this wanton, fast, promiscuous girl that didn’t care about anyone but herself. Gatsby himself recalled the evening he had met her by quoting, “It excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy-it increased her value in his eyes.” Umm…this should have been his warning to run for the hills.Daisy obviously cared very little for Gatsby. She barely waited before she was dating some guy in New Orleans, and then moved on to Tom. This is not the epic love story the movie portrays it to be. It’s simply a book of the ramifications for a guy who fell in love with the wrong girl. "
1522,Meghan Shaffer,"Here's the thing. I loved listening to this audio book. LOVED. I have attempted to read the book twice and ended up not finishing it both times because I found it boring. I find that strange, but whatever. This book just came alive for me through listening. I'm so glad I gave it a shot!I absolute love the character of Jay Gatsby. He is way beyond flawed, but he is a powerful character with many facets. I didn't love the setting, but I loved what the setting said about each of the characters in how they interacted with wealth (or lack thereof), power, and social status. To me, Daisy is an unlikable character. I think Gatsby really is too in some ways, but for some reason I understand his flaws and give him grace, whereas with Daisy, I just don't like her.I liked the way the story was told through Nick's perspective. It was a little hard to believe how he was always around for the major twists and such, but I still enjoyed hearing the story filtered through his mind. It was also a short listen (5 hours) which is a must for me with 3 my littles. Even just at 5 hours, it took me an entire week to listen to it while I cleaned the kitchen every night. "
1523,Donna,"The Great Gatsby is an amazing, magical story set in 1920's New York, the time of glitz and glamour before the Great Depression. It is narrated by a stock agent named Nick Caraway who has just moved to NYC. His story is turned from boring to intriguing when he crosses paths with Jay Gatsby, his flamboyant and mysterious next door neighbor who's known for throwing lavish parties every night. As Nick and Jay become close, Jay sheds some light on his troubled past, which happens to include Nick's cousin, Daisy. Jay and Daisy were together five years ago, and now Jay wants Nick to help him win her back. The only problem; she's now married. This book left my head spinning. The story is a confusing jigsaw puzzle until this one place in the story where your mind goes CLICK, and every thing makes sense. It's nothing like the older movie, but it's exactly like the new one, down to the script( but read the book first, of coarse). There were many points in the book where I cried for their losses, and even more where I laughed at their stupidity. Still, it was definitely a story worth reading and a story that everyone can learn from."
1524,Mary Ronan Drew,"The Great Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald. Perhaps the most famous American novel of the 1920s, The Great Gatsby has been riding a sine curve ever since, going into and out of fashion at regular intervals. It is heading into a new popularity phase right now. Which is good, because it just may be the Great American Novel we used to talk about.There is so much in this short novel, so many extraordinary characters (Fitzgerald said he thought Tom Buchanan was his best creation), settings you can almost smell and touch, a seemingly simple but actually quite complex plot line, a little mystery, a little murder. And lots of themes and symbols. An English teacher could go nuts with the theme of time, with which the book starts and ends, the American Dream, travel by automobile (both Jordan and Baker were makers of automobiles at the time), wealth, honesty, and clothes.And of course the green light flashing at the end of Daisy's dock.I picked up the book because the 22nd Avenue Book Club is going to be discussing it next month. I'm so glad we chose it."
1525,Thahura,"This book was very deep and I loved the way Gatsby had so much hope and love for Daisy. But Daisy was bitch and and said she loved Tom and ran over Myrtle. Tom Buchanan was a really theatrical character and was cool, I think he was my favourite character. Nick was really nice and I find it surprising how a person can keep all their opinions to them self. Overall, the book had so much meaning and romance and sadness to it all at the same time and was enjoyable to read. Good luck to whoever is reading it or is looking forward to reading it."
1526,Rajiv,"""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.""Enough said."
1527,Alif Shahed,"I re-read this book last night (in order to be well-equipped for the Gatsby Garden Party I will be attending this Sunday) and (not only came up with something smart to say in this review at last but) had a few revelations. This book really stuck with me because I developed a very special relationship with the text itself. I realize how shallow I was when I first read it. This book isn't about love. It's about the  idea  of being in love. As in, Gatsby isn't in love with Daisy. He's in love with the  idea  of loving Daisy. He doesn't want to form a relationship with Daisy either. He has this imaginary perception on how he wants their relationship to work out─the way it was when they had first met. Gatsby doesn't want a new relationship with Daisy, no. He wants to re-create the relationship he's formed with her in his mind, and put it into real-time. Yes, Gatsby  wants  to love Daisy, but he also wants to turn back the time to when he  did  love Daisy. He wants  that  love and wishes to recreate it, and he's been living through that relationship in his mind all his life to the point where he isn't in love with Daisy anymore─as she's a completely shallow, money loving trophy wife─he's merely in love with the idea of Daisy, with the idea of loving Daisy, with the idea of loving one so shallow and vain. Tom isn't in love with Daisy either. He's in love with the idea of having a wife. He's in love with the idea of a 'trophy wife.' Just as Nick isn't in (platonic) love with Gatsby either, he's in love with the idea of recreating yourself, the idea of simply choosing a new identity and living a life based on the connotations that identity is given by society, by yourself, and by the entire human race. That's why this book stuck with me. See, in order to love the Great Gatsby you have to be in love with the text, the prose and especially the messages and hints  behind  the text. I suppose. But Fitzgerald's true message is hid in the last lines of the book (Or so I perceived it): Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter—to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning——So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.   Part of Review where reviewer rambles on about nonsensical things I guess the reason as to why people may hate this book is because they had to analyze it at school, or something along the lines of that. Fortunately, I live in Canada and here we focused on 'Canadian Literature,' so I particularly enjoyed this. Although, I wish we did studies on American Literature here too, American literature is  so  much cooler than Canadian Literature. (But that's just my opinion).  Part of review where the reviewer can't think of a proper way to end the review  WELL. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? GO TO BOOKSTORE. BUY BOOK. OPEN BOOK. READ BOOK. YOU'RE WELCOME. "
1528,Rachel,"The Great Gatsby is one of the best American novels of all time according to various websites and scholars and after witnessing it myself I can fully agree. The story is narrated by Nick Carraway, a war veteran who decides to join the exciting world of bonds. He leaves everything behind in St. Paul and moves to New York, staying in a small little cabin among various huge mansions owned by the people of ""new wealth"". One of them is Jay Gatsby, who's very existence is filled with rumors. To Nick at first he seems like an average guy until Nick discovers a secret about Gatsby involving one of Nick's removed cousins, Daisy Buchanan. My teacher told me at the beginning of the book that I'm either going to love Daisy or hate her. I hated her. She reminded me of a spoiled five year old and I think most would agree with me. Daisy is married to Tom, one of the most hated character in literary history. He's arrogant, hateful and controlling, which made me feel kind of bad for Daisy but that does little to help her case with me. There's also Jordan Baker, Daisy's BFF and somewhat of a love interest for Nick. I didn't mind her for most of the novel but it was the last three or so chapters that made me dislike her, you'll see why. Finally there's the ""poor"" people, George Wilson and his ""charming"" wife Myrtle. I don't have much to say about them except they are huge in the last three chapters. Fitzgerald did an outstanding job and his writing style was phenomenal. It was also an easy read and every chapter is more exciting then the last. I thoroughly enjoyed and loved this book. It's most definitely on my to get book list. Now I just have to cross my fingers and hope the movie doesn't butcher it, I have high hopes! This book is definitely worth reading and should be read by everyone! "
1529,Zac Wilson,"For many years, it seems, I have been deeply interested in all that is the Jazz Age. My fascination had lead me to look for the write piece of literature that could satisfy my want for more knowledge about the 1920's, without boring me with just straight facts. I can confidently say this book was everything I was looking for. The Great Gatsby is a short but sweet summary of the life of the wealthy in the 20's.Nothing less is to be expected of F. Scott Fitzgerald, who published the book in 1925. From huge mansions, expensive coupes, and huge, fancy parties, Fitzgerald underlines the typicality of what the public thinks of the Jazz Age. By combining aspects of the Roaring 20's with a storyline incomparable to any other, Fitzgerald delivers a wonderful reading experience to those who approach the book with a historic perspective.The book's contribution to old American culture is not the only way in which the book deserves the best rating. Mysterious characters such as Jay Gatsby keep the story interesting for the book's entirety. Different events throughout the novel can only begin to describe what the true intent of these characters are. Overall, this book is one that was meant to be a classic not only because of its historical value, but also of its plot that keeps you guessing."
1530,Paul Gaya Ochieng Simeon Juma,"Beautiful book.I thought it boring at first.The end did not disappoint.The Great Gatsby's personality is interesting, cool, calm and collected. not to mention deeply in love with Daisy."
1531,Tara Frye," Before I read this book. I knew about it and I always thought that the 1920's was an amazing era from the flappers,gansters and the prohibition. I thought it was so interesting and mysteious. I watched the movie before I read the book and it was amazing. When I read the book it was in my enlish class and for once I wasn't bored to death. I loved this book. I like the quotes in this book. I like the way you could imagine how the characters sounded like. It was very realistic. I liked this book so much I think I'm going to do fan art with the quotes from the book."
1532,Oly,"Comencé el libro hace varios meses con unas expectativas altísimas (cualquiera que lo conozca sabrá las maravillas que se dicen sobre él), así que mi chasco fue bastante grande cuando, prácticamente desde la primera página, me decepcionó por completo. Está sobrevalorado, me dije. Así que lo abandoné. De todas formas le quise dar una nueva oportunidad, por lo menos terminarlo esta vez. ¿Mi opinión ahora? Sólo diré que cerré el libro hace un rato, lo coloqué en la estantería, me senté y comencé a llorar. Espero que las personas que le den una oportunidad sean capaces de llegar a la esencia del libro y no se queden simplemente en la superficie; El gran Gatsby es mucho más que la frivolidad de la clase alta de una época llena de decadencia."
1533,Angie,"There are many topics the novel touches and are related to our frivolous and shallow society.We see the story's developement through Gatsby's neighbour's eyes, Nick Carraway. I can compare our era with the Roaring Twenties and it's so ironical that even though the country passed the Great Depresion Era, we are like everyone had been before the Great Depresion.It's incredible how a frivolous society can make someone forget what is the most important by using the glamour and the material things to forget it. There is also mentioned what we call party friends. Gatsby had a lot of party friends while in the end he only had two real friends.In the end you agree with Nick about everyone's indifference towards Gatsby's death, how no one wanted to be at the funeral and prefer to continue with their silly and shallow lives. He was specially dissapointed and resentful about the behaviour the Buchanans had taken since the beginning of Myrtle's dead.Despite not having enough evidence, it is implied that Daisy told Tom about the Mrs. Wilson's accident details: that she killed her unintentionally, and Gatsby was going to respond for it (by the way, had Daisy already known that Tom had an affair with Mrs. Wilson?). Tom got the chance to hit two birds at once (or three if we include make up with Daisy).Like Nick, I also felt angry about how the Buchanans escaped and waited someone to clean up their mess.It was also very kind of Nick about telling Gatsby that he was much better person than anyone around."
1534,Shannon,"I've never been one to enjoy a classic just because of its status- Pride and Prejudice, while well written is frustratingly tame and the best part of Oliver Twist in my opinion is when he gets shot. I read Gatsby two years ago and failed to appreciate it, mostly because I rushed through it. However, upon re-reading the novel, I found it entirely different to my first interpretation. Fitzgerald's writing is both lyrical and haunting, particularly in the final paragraph in which he draws us into a stunning climax and crescendo, which seems to echo as we read. This is the cornerstone of the book- not the story, but the language that so perfectly describes the futility and mindless destruction of consumerism. This is why the film was so awful- the best part of Gatsby is the language, the lens through which the story is seen- the Film couldn't recreate this, focusing too hard on the story itself and making it into something it was not. Gatsby is not this story of romance and star-crossed lovers, it's a beautiful observation of the fragility of human lives, and the false sense of immortality that we receive from a consumerist lifestyle, which ultimately shows us that our possessions, no matter how lavish or expensive cannot save us from our own mortality or our own mistakes. Books are personal and intimate, films are for mass audiences; so while the book can show us this, the film cannot despite a valiant effort . (Also, when Nick is looking out of the window in the film, the editing is abysmal.) The love affair of Gatsby and Daisy is an intriguing observation of American society after World War One, a war that wasted the blood of millions. Gatsby desperately grasps at the innocence he left behind, however he finds that innocence itself was never what he believed it to be; Daisy is imperfect, shallow and is controlled by nought but corruption and greed, embodied in her husband. Nick meanwhile is a fascinating representation of the inner sense of dissolution and cynicism that resulted from the war, and a fairly accurate prediction of the mentality of American society during the Great Depression- he knows that there is no innocence in the world, that love, in any form, is just a way to pass the time, something to chase but not to have in a world where people are grasping at everything within reach then casting it away because they can. Personally, I feel that Gatsby represents America during the 20's while Nick, in his cynicism and his disdain observes the faults in such a lifestyle. He also embodies America during the Depression, however Fitzgerald couldn't have known this. An amazing novel, worthy of its status."
1535,Stuart Gilkison,Just reread this on my trip to Boston. I understand how divisive this book can be. Bringing back memories of being forced to read this in Middle School. I love this book and will always love it despite Hollywood trying to ruin it with horrible casting decisions. Book is layered and breaks my heart each time I read it.
1536,Eliana Rivero," Pero, alta sobre la ciudad, nuestra hilera de ventanas amarillas tenían que haberle brindado su ración de secretos humanos al observador casual de las calles crepusculares, y yo era un observador también, que miraba hacia arriba con asombro. Yo estaba adentro y afuera, al mismo tiempo encantado y molesto por la interminable variedad de la vida Es un libro precioso. Me pasaron dos cosas con esta novela: ya había visto la película (buenísima, por cierto) y tenía muchísimas expectativas por todo el rollo de que es un clásico. Aún así, lo devoré y quedé muy satisfecha. Hay que perderle el miedo a los clásicos.Al principio, pensaba que era una historia de amor, pero luego caí en cuenta que más que esto, es una historia de apariencias, engaños y sobre todo, de decepciones. No puedo decir absolutamente nada nuevo sobre el libro: prosa limpia, sencilla, con hermosas imágenes sobre el corazón humano y la inmensidad urbanística que rodea a los personajes. Estructuralmente es bastante tradicional, no es nada nuevo. Lo que engancha, quizá, es su narración tan cuidada y una historia tan absorbente.Carraway funge como el mejor narrador posible porque es testigo y a la vez personaje: ve lo que sienten los demás pero también siente él mismo. No sé si logré encariñarme con algún personaje: Daisy es totalmente detestable (view spoiler)[ vamos, lloró en la casa de Jay al ver tantas camisas hermosas porque supo que de no haberse casado con Tom ella aprovecharía tanta fama y dinero. De todas formas, ya había dejado de amarlo y amaba a su marido. Esas cosas pasan. La vida es así  (hide spoiler)]. Jay, Tom, Wilson, inspiran lástima. El único que parece con los pies en la tierra es Carraway.Creo que la gran perdición en todo esto y en general, en la vida, es no aceptar que el pasado es pasado y se tiene que vivir el presente, sin más. El pasado pasa y no se puede vivir pensando en que algún día se revivirá. En serio, es un libro precioso y me encantó tanto como la película (?)"
1537,Tim,"This was not the first time I have read this classic - it is probably the fourth. I have to say that I was not as blown away this time as I have been in the past, but it is still a great book, a classic, a stellar example of the Great American Novel. It is also a very teachable book, with many interesting points for readers - the glamor, the romance, the wealth, the dreaming and longing for somebody to love. But what struck me hardest this time was that the book is primarily about loss and illusion and defeat. Gatsby, as great as he was, did not get what he wanted. He may have even wanted something that could never have existed for him. It is a deeply disillusioned book, with a bleak view of romance. In this story, unlike in Wharton's ""The Age of Innocence"", true romance does stand a chance against the crushing weight of social pressure. In fact, despite all the romancing that is going on, there does not seem to be much real love between any of the characters, except for Gatsby's obsessive love for Daisy (who responds to the power of his passion and personality, but how does she really feel?), and the camraderie between Gatsby and the narrator.The whole story is as fascinating to me as it ever was. Fitzgerald was capable of writing some of the most graceful and beguiling prose that anyone has written. And the character of Gatsby, that embodiment of American dreaming, that rags to riches guy, that smooth gangster with a naïve and loving heart - he was probably FSF's greatest creation, and one of the greatest creations in American literature."
1538,Claire Carriedo,"A dir poco stupendo.Nonostante qualche punto in cui la narrazione si perde mettendo a caso un flashback oppure uno stacco temporale troppo ampio (per cui ci ho messo un po' a riprendere a capire), devo proprio ammettere che è un bellissimo libro.Poetico per certi versi, specialmente all'ultimo capitolo.La triste storia di Gatsby, l'amore incontrollato per Daisy, è tutto così avvincente. Fosse stato per me, il libro sarebbe dovuto terminare nel momento in cui i due (Gatsby e Daisy) si rivedono e si ""rimettono insieme"" celando la loro relazione a Tom, il marito di lei.Sarebbe stato un finale aperto, ma allo stesso tempo soddisfacente. Invece no! Caracolla tutto all'improvviso e il racconto diventa tragico.Per quanto invece riguarda la relazione tra Nick e Jordan l'ho trovata superflua, ma in fondo se si usa un narratore esterno credo che anche la storia di quest'ultimo risulti fondamentale. De gustibus.Il personaggio che ho odiato di più è indiscutibilmente Tom: vile, stupido e prepotente. Il genere di uomo alla quale mi terrei TOTALMENTE alla larga. Non mi piace il modo in cui si impone su Daisy (anche se lei sembra essere un po' frivola), il fatto che le urli in faccia che lo ha amato, che non è possibile che non l'abbia mai fatto, facendola passare come la cretina di turno. In quel preciso capitolo l'ho odiato sul serio, anche se non mi aveva fatto una buona impressione fin dall'inizio. Tradisce spudoratamente la moglie e si permette di fare la morale a lei quando ritrova un vecchio amore che sicuramente la tratta meglio di chiunque altro!? No. La frase che mi ha fatto disprezzare maggiormente Tom è stata: ""[...] Ogni tanto faccio qualche scappatella ma ritorno sempre da lei, e in fondo al cuore non smetto mai di amarla.""TOTALE ODIO!Direi che questo libricino, seppur piccolo, ha risvegliato in me parecchie sensazione. L'ho amato davvero e sono contenta di averlo letto.So che a breve uscirà il film e mi spaventa un po' perchè ho il terrore che verrà rovinato l'ennesimo classico, mi auguro vivamente di aver torto."
1539,Danielle,"One of the rare classics that lives up to the hype. Every time I read this book I'm swept away by the amazing writing--fluid, beautiful, and absolutely effortless. The story is one I shouldn't like: self-centered rich people cheat on and with each other in 1922 while some sap named Nick Carraway watches on. But....I don't know how Fitzgerald did it, but he imbues the story with a sense of beauty and freshness that makes me, a twentysomething from the digital age, put myself right in the middle of things and relate to Gatsby and Nick. Usually, I hate stories with unlikable characters, and none of the characters in this story are especially likable. Daisy is dumb and self-centered; Tom is cruel and arrogant; Jordan is an overgrown brat; Gatsby is too caught up in the past to enjoy the present; Nick is at most the only character who isn't utterly despicable. There are no heroes or villains in this story; you either root for someone or you hate everyone. Yet there's some magic going on here, because every time I reach the last few chapters, my heart breaks all over again. I should have hated this book. Hated it with a passion, the way I hated most assigned reading back in high school. But I don't. This is one of my favorite books of all time, simply because it is gorgeous. I love this book. I know you may not, and I don't care. "
1540,Sukanto,"A re-read with a better perspective this time. And sorry Howard Roark, because Jay Gatsby trumps you easily! It is imperfections that make a man, not water tight perfections. There is greed, there is love and there is love for greed. This splendid piece of writing by Fitzgerald may have been set in the early 20th century America, but I found there is hardly any aspect in terms of acquiring things like wealth and love, to have changed even today. "
1541,Said Zaripov,It is one of my most favourite books so far. I really enjoyed the novel and I think that this book can actually present some life lessons to the audience. 
1542,Jose Luis,"No lo sabía, pero leo que esta novela fue un gran fracaso, hasta que después de la segunda guerra mundial se la empezó a considerar una obra maestra. Puede que no sea el fiel retrato de los años 20 que creemos ahora, pero desde luego parece una de esas novelas que saben captar el espíritu de su tiempo. El de Gatsby es el retrato de un hombre sin escrúpulos que prospera en plena burbuja económica, como un tiburón entre los inconscientes Toms y Daisies, camino del desastre. Pero es también un trepa social, y un imbécil fascinado por el brillo del oro y el tintineo de las monedas que cargan esos niños terribles, mientras destruyen personas y cosas, entre quienes pretende ser uno más. Gatsby es un gangster, pero probablemente sus principios morales son más elevados que los de esa chusma de los hamptons. O no. Qué más da. Quién necesita ética en un acuario de tiburones.Pero los hallazgos de esta novela, para mí, son tres: la elección del narrador, ese punto de vista, ese lugar estratégico desde el que contar la historia. En segundo lugar, su voz, con ese tono nebuloso y decadente, capaz de proyectar una visión nostálgica de un mundo muerto antes de su muerte. Me recuerda la voz de Durrell, recordando la Alejandría perdida, sólo que el mundo de Gatsby aún vivía cuando Fitzgerald lo retrató.Pero, en tercer lugar, y más discutible, una impresión personal: que se trata de un narrador infidente. Dice de sí mismo: ""I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known."" Una de las pocas personas honradas, honestas... no, sinceras, que ha conocido. Y una mierda, Carraway. A pesar de sus protestas de que no quiere juzgar a nadie, de su manía por presentársenos como un narrador imparcial, entre lo que nos cuenta y lo que ocurre, o lo que siente, hay una niebla no menos espesa que las que difuminan su relato y las madrugadas de Long Island. Carraway se deja engañar, se cree las mentiras de Gatsby -Oxford, San Francisco, su family all dead- porque quiere, porque en el fondo comparte la fascinación de Gatsby por los millonarios y su mundo, aunque no tenga el valor de Gatsby y su determinación; porque en el fondo no es más que otra polilla. Y lo sabes, Carraway :-PY luego está la trama con toques de enredo y crimen, con sus sorpresas y su aire de partida de ajedrez trilero. Me he divertido y he disfrutado tanto de la vieja traducción que andaba por casa como de la elegancia del original (recomiendo el ejercicio para estudiantes de inglis) de esta novela que es puro siglo XX. Entramos en la era de los Gastbies y los Carraways."
1543,Emily Polson,"""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.""<3 Fitzgerald's prose is perfection, his characters beautifully flawed, and this story the embodiment of excellence. Wonderful.Reread (for the second time...) May 9-10, 2013. Still just as wonderful. No, scratch that--better. I'm starting to think TGG is an acquired taste, like coffee. You just can't appreciate much the first time through, but after a while and a couple more times through, you realize it's now a vital part of your existence. (Or something like that. At least for me.)Reread (for the fourth time...) March 2014. Almost every sentence is deserving of special attention for its brilliant composition, and I noticed this especially this time through. Fitzgerald is not just a writer, he is a musician. Reread (for the fifth time...) December 2015. Listened to an audiobook version. Very compelling to get the whole story, in beautiful poetic form, all at once on a long road trip."
1544,Kaycee9965 Cee,"Tragic, beautiful, full-of-hope book. There is an impact in this book. In the end; everything comes together. Then falls apart. And this is based on a true story as well. Shows you how real life is. How far feelings can get you. How far it will. What. A. Book. The movie's alright. But I always prefer the book. At first, it's a slow beginning. But then, it all snowballs down, letting gravity and to weight rush it down Down  Down. And after the blink of an eye;It's all beautiful. It put hope into my heart. Not everything is a fairytale, people. This story is raw,Unedited. Unexpected. This changes hearts. That is; f you're willing to accept it all. You won't regret reading this. "
1545,Luke,"I don't remember whether it was my sick ""Let's read classics"" obsession or the great, the breathtaking and the genius song Florence + The Machine brought to the screen adaptation(remake?) of the book, or both, but things went so that I hurried to order this book and read it immediately. It must have been my hidden sense, silently telling me to read it for I would enjoy it days after finishing it too and it would stay on my mind like those few ones that leave you stranded.For me it was fascinating finding where the lyrics of her song came from and when I finally got an interpretation of the meaning of it, it was even better finishing the book.For me, it was a new way to tell a love story or maybe more than one. I enjoyed the way it is slightly depressing, living the green-light-blinded dream of Jay Gatsby, the way the story-teller is so detached to the dramas and only does, with impressive simplicity, what he thinks a person with his role should do. I find it amazingly clever and beautiful and I do recommend it to virtually all readers. "
1546,Khaoula Bahri,"This book really touched me! I thought it was amazingly written. First I saw the movie which let me say was a perfect adaptation, it is the first time I can't choose whichever I liked more. In the book Fitzgeraled knew how to picture the desperation in Gatsby's eyes, the confusion he was going through. And Leonardo Dicaprio was just the best man for the role. I felt absorbed by the book not because I was impatient to know what's next, but the writer's got that talent of capturing it's reader. He's message wasn't so complicated yet not so simple either. I'm glad I felt that connection with Jay Gatsby, how I wanted at some point to be somebody's Daisy, Wandered if such men can exist. I know some people think that Gatsby's just an obsessed man with a shallow empty dream, but for me he's a man in love, a loyal man."
1547,Juliana Concepcion,"I can say that after reading The Great Gatsby, that it is one of my favorites, if not my favorite book. At the time that I read this book, Gatsby’s struggle in loving someone who maybe did not feel the same exact way about him was something that really resonated with me. It still does, and it was just nice to see that in the book. However, there was much more to the book than just that. Struggles of classism, the illusion of the American Dream, and identity were all major topics included in the book. Additionally, I found that I had a previously undiscovered fascination and appreciation of the 1920s, and all of the jazz music and such from that era is just really cool to me. In reading the book, I particularly liked the writing style of F. Scott Fitzgerald. My favorite quote, and it is one that I believe will stick with me forever, is “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.” This quote is a reminder to me that there are some things from our past that we just wish we could relive, and although we are still moving on in life, as we must, if there is something that has happened in our past that was important or very meaningful to us, deep down we will always be stuck thinking about that time. I think of it as being stubborn in a sense, but in a genuine way. Sometimes we just can’t help but ponder a specific time in our lives that really meant something to us."
1548,Paola Gabriella,"Me ha gustado muchísimo más de lo que esperaba que me gustase, Fitzgerald escribía de una manera tan pero tan hermosa que me ha enamorado con sus palabras, su manera de describir las situaciones, las metáforas que usaba para dar su crítica, brillante.Al principio me gustó, pero hasta ahí, pero el final fue lo que me hizo que me encantara, (eso y que quedé con ganas de casarme con el estilo literario de F. Scott) Los personajes, sobre todo Gatsby y Nick me han encantado. Gatsby es tremendo personaje, y tiene una muy buena historia de fondo, y hay este halo de misterio que lo rodea, pero como Nick lo conoce mejor que la mayoría de la gente, podemos ver quien es Jay Gatsby realmente.Nick Carraway, ¿qué puedo decir. El desarrollo de ese personaje es más que plausible, me sorprendió muchísimo el cambio de su personalidad entre el principio y el final del libro, un muy buen narrador de la historia.Los Buchanan, terminé odiando a los dos con todo mi ser, pero mi odio a Daisy fue acumulativo, en cambio Tom es el ser más repelente, pedante, idiota que puede ser descrito, y cualquier persona que haya leído al menos cinco páginas de El Gran Gatsby sabe de lo que hablo.Las metáforas estaban en todos lados, los ojos de TJ Eckleburg, la historia del mayordomo, como TODO en este libro es amarillo y dorado, la luz verde, el Valle de las Cenizas. . .Son un aditivo genial a la historia que le da una tridimensionalidad, una nueva manera de leerlo, otra percepción de la historia, son como capítulos escondidos dentro del mismo libro.El final es un final muy triste, pero no triste de llorar mares, triste que después de leerlo te queda esta atmósfera de tristeza por esa historia, por esos personajes y sabes que eso que paso no debió de haber ocurrido, no merecía ocurrir eso."
1549,Faerie Knight,I loved this book! My school principal spoiled the ending for me before I got to it. :(
1550,Dareen,"t's a beautiful and tragic novel, so simple yet so rich. It doesn't take long to read, the story stands on its own.. The green light, the eyeglasses, the valley of ashes. I love it, even though the ending was quietly devastating."
1551,Alisha,"Somehow I missed reading The Great Gatsby in high school, and apart from a few things here and there: I somehow also made it through spoiler-free.  With the new film that came out earlier this year and my recently declared English major: I decided that this summer I had to right the wrong and read it. I would be lying if I said I went in with no pre-conceptions, but to say that I was pleasantly surprised would be a great understatement. Initially I was enamored with every character (well, apart from Tom, but I felt it Fitzgerald wrote him just so that, if I did care for him it all the author himself may have been offended) even Daisy. Maybe even especially Daisy. But, as the story progressed and through Carraway I saw the glamour crescendo, then fade, I felt almost a sense of heartbreak as Daisy's carelessness and heartlessness showed through, and as Gatsby's facade continued to fool even him, and Carraway's disillusionment increased.The Great Gatsby is (quite easily) numbered among my favorites. Stunning with its prose and tragedy, I have not been able to stop thinking about it since I finished it three days ago. I may never stop. "
1552,Bhaskar kumar,I am not at all surprised to know that this book is considered a classic.Heart-touching.
1553,Loulya,"The Great Gatsby is a 180 pages classic written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The narrator of this novel is a young writer, Nick Carraway, who tells the incredible story of Jay Gatsby, the mysterious millionaire. Nick lives next door to Gatsby and when invited to one of his remarkable parties one night, he brings his married cousin Daisy along and Gatsby instantly falls in love with her. From then on, Gatsby gets closer to Nick's girlfriend, Jordan as he desperately seeks to lure Daisy into falling in love with him. Everything Gatsby does, his amazing parties, his unforgettable lifestyle, his perfect manners, is a way to impress Daisy. As we read into the book, we uncover the many secrets behind this classic. By the end, we discover that Gatsby had known Daisy from before and had had a relationship with her, of which he had never gotten over. Furthermore, conflict starts to rise between Daisy's husband Tom, and Gatsby, as Tom starts to realise the fact that Daisy is still in love with Gatsby. As we read on, the tensions in the story and between the characters become more and more prominent, ending the story with a great tragedy. This story is told from the viewpoint of Nick Carraway in a very distinct form of writing. The more he gets to Gatsby, the more we get to know him. Carraway's emotions are clearly displayed in the novel which allows us to understand how his relationship with Jay Gatsby strengthens as he gets to know him better. Fitzgerald does an outstanding job at character development, notably with Gatsby and Daisy. The novel is so detailed, that we can genuinely picture Daisy and reflect upon her as a real person. In addition, the specifics of the setting in which this story is held, are very well described, which makes the story all the more extravagant than it already is. Gatsby is the biggest role in this novel and his greatness is extremely well developed by his friend, Carraway. Fitzgerald is also poet, so by no doubt the words in his novel, with the way it is written, can have such impact upon us readers. I rated this novel very highly because I think it is one of the best stories ever told. I love the fact that the story is told from the viewpoint of one of the main characters in the novel, and I love that we see everything through that character's eyes. Because of this, we can only understand what he understands, which brings the story to life. I highly recommend this book to people interested in poetry and teenagers who enjoy reading because although it isn't the easiest read, it's worth the time. The book is not too long, however, it's long enough to tell an amazing and influential story. "
1554,Samah,"Beautiful - how can I ever write a review describing this book? Just beautiful. I'm impressed by the writing, it's written in gorgeous classic style. Fitzgerald succesfully took us to the Jazz Age and let us live with the characters. The second thing I loved is how Gatsby is the main character, but you see it through Nick's eyes, not through Gatsby's. The way we get to know Gatsby more and more -through a strangers eyes- during the story, is done so nicely that you can't have anything but great sympathy for Gatsby. It ends up being a really sad story and I didn't see the plot twist coming. The way simple things were described so magnificent -such as a smile - made me re-read pages and it filled my social media platforms with quotes. It's not just a book, it's a literary masterpiece and the symbolism shows how well Fitzgerald has done trying to convey the message: the eyes of T.J. Eckleburg and of course the green light. The most important thing is the link he made with the American Dream, which completes it perfectly. A story of (destroyed) dreams and a great deal of hope. A story that first leaves you empty; and then thinking. Thank you Fitzgerald, for a wonderful message wrapped in one of the best tales I've ever read."
1555,Mawa Mahima,"It's an A* novel, you know? THAT perfect novel that talks about mostly everything there is to talk about back then. "
1556,Jocelyn,Loved this novel so much! I can't believe it took me this long to get to The Great Gatsby. I'm thinking of going on a Fitzgerald bender.
1557,Kiley Wilke,This is my favorite book. ever. I've read this book four times and each time it gets better. It's a classic. 
1558,Karran,"The Great Gatsby is a truly wonderful book. I must admit that I was pretty excited to read this novel when I found out that I would be studying it for English Literature, as it is one of those classics that has been praised greatly over time. When I first attempted to read this book, it did take me quite a while to finish. I found it to be very dense and at times I found Fitzgeralds writing style difficult to decipher. As time went by, I learned more about this novel in class, and the more I read into the chapters and paid attention to details within it, the more I began to love The Great Gatsby! The way Fitzgerald structured the novel is great, especially how Gatsby's true self was revealed slowly within the book. The symbolism in this novel is amazing... with the green light, the eyes of Dr. T J Eckleberg, The Valley of Ashes... just EVERYTHING in it! Even the title fits the novel perfectly.   ""This fella's a regular Belasco. It's a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism!""   as Owl Eyes would say. When the facade was stripped away and Gatsby true self was revealed, I couldn't help but admire him for his extraordinary gift for hope like the narrator, Nick Carraway. A definite 5/5 stars for me! I've already read The Great Gatsby twice and I wouldn't hesitate to revisit the roaring 20's again."
1559,J.C.," Review from the first time I read it:This book, from the first edition cover to every sentence, is perfection, in my mind. To me this is the kind of book that every true writer should strive to emulate and wish to be. Anyone who loves to read great literature and hasn't read this book, I feel very badly for them. it's a must have/must read.""Second review:I sound like a kid with that review, don't I? So this is my second time reading it, and of course I tore it apart with a closer, more experienced lens, and I have to say I still greatly enjoyed reading it. It's like coming back to an old favorite film you haven't seen in ages, you remember all the best parts and feel that high of nostalgia, but at the same time the faults and weaknesses that you never spotted before show up and alter your perception a little. Don't get me wrong, I still think it's a fine novel, but it's definitely not perfection. It's a beautiful work of art though, and I can see what Fitzgerald was doing behind the curtain that I couldn't before. Also, there adverbs. EVERYWHERE. I was shocked by the level of adverbs in it. I don't know if adverbs were much more accepted at the time or if ol' Fitz used them specifically so that the writing could move at a quicker pace. For the most part it was used mostly for the dialogue interactions, ""he said presently"", and so forth, but when it came to narration the adverbs were very sparse. Fitzgerald certainly wanted to use poetic but plain language, one reason I think so many literature courses LOVE to use it as an example of literature and how to search for metaphor, etc. I still highly recommend the book, and definitely think it should be a book read OUTSIDE of the classroom (unless the teacher is really awesome). "
1560,Lavinia,"One day I'll write a proper review. Or maybe not.***OK, I’m pretty confused and ashamed that people “like” this one line review above I’ve had for years on GR, but the truth is, what can you actually tell about a book everyone has read at least once, or if not, they’ve watched a film version of it?I’ve read it multiple times and I still like it. I wouldn’t consider it my favourite book (you do tend to reread your favourite books, right?), but I have this urge every few years (late spring/summer) to sit down and enjoy it. And, obviously, every time I discover something new about it, because that’s the joy of rereading, I suppose: not be thrilled about the subject - who’s doing what to whom - but the writing, the setting, the narrator’s voice (oh, Nick, I love you so much!) and the small details, like who Belasco was and why the owl-eyed man mentioned him in relation to Gatsby’s surprisingly real library or the comparison with Trimalchio (which was the original name of the novel) a.s.o.That’s also not a review, but well...(2015)"
1561,Nancy,"I read this book in high school and I didn't really get it. Then I read it again recently and it became my favorite book ever. I don't know if I've read any book that is as well-written as ""The Great Gatsby."" Here, of course, ""well-written"" is according to my own internal metric.Since ""The Great Gatsby"" was so good, I went on to read some of his other work. I read a collection of Fitzgerald's short stories, and then I read his first novel, ""This Side of Paradise"" but I found all of these to be much inferior to ""The Great Gatsby."" In fact, if I'd read these works first, I would not have imagined that Fitzgerald could have produced such an amazing novel as ""The Great Gatsby.""Fitzgerald had some themes that he liked to come back to again and again. The character Gatsby has many incarnations in his short stories, and then again as the main character in ""This Side of Paradise."" But in these other instances, the characters' traits are exaggerated grotesquely and they have none of the fullness and depth of Gatsby. These other stories read more like moralistic fables where the main character is representative of a type. In contrast, ""The Great Gatsby"" ranks so high on my list, that there is nothing I could ever say against it.So... Fitzgerald improved with time and experience? The effort that he put into countless drafts for ""The Great Gatsby"" really paid off? I'm sure I could find the answer easily by looking up biographies and criticisms of Fitzgerald. But that would take the fun out of it. I'll just make up my own conjectures as I read more of his books. "
1562,Samar,"If I could give more than 5 stars, I would. Seriously.The title is truly apt. I've never read a novel except Pride and Prejudice whose passages have remained with me. I can remember entire paragraphs of this novel. It is just that remarkable.By all means the basic story was not extraordinary. We have Jay Gatsby, an impoverished boy from an inconsequential background who wishes to rise in society. He has ambitions, wits and the necessary keenness to bring this off. And along the way he falls in love with a wealthy, beautiful girl, Daisy, whom he must relinquish due to his low position. Thus start the series of struggles which Gatsby endures in order to attain his version of the American Dream, personified in Daisy Buchanan. However Fitzgerald adds something uniquely his own to this novel. Apart from the extensive and haunting symbolism of this novel (the eyes, the green light, geographical placement etc.); there is a certain nameless quality about Gatsby which even Nick can't place. But that it's forceful, and almost too bright. It's the strength of his optimism perhaps or the drive of his goal. I don't know.I love it when authors can tie in human relationships to become emblematic of larger realities on the socio-political front. Gatsby and Daisy's romance is just such an event. Daisy's silence is a higher betrayal than any words could have expressed. She is frightened by the intensity of Gatsby's will and desires; frightened of leaving her golden perch, her aristocratic standing and lofty comfort to become embroiled in a world of which she was once a part-few ancestors past-but that is now a remote and alien existence. Gatsby is hugely objectionable on the moral front but somehow Fitzgerald casts him in such a light that the reader comes to see only the power of his selfless devotion; even in the face of bitter slander, cruel rejection, and horrific death. He pays in blood for the beauty of his beliefs. The writing is simply poetic. There is a lilting quality to it and most of its brilliance owes to Nick's character. Without him, the liminal space would not have been created between the West and the East-a space which Gatsby and Nick both come to occupy though to a varying degree.The novel is brief but it lacks in nothing. A near perfect execution! Thank You Fitzgerald. "
1563,Teagan Stewart,"OH MY GOD, I AM SO COMPLETELY FLOORED! I have so many questions and so much commentary and so much analysis, and I really need to have an in depth discussion with someone about this incredibly amazing masterpiece! The language he uses, how prevalent the weather is in the novel, he makes strategies like this revitalized, modern, new and extremely effective. I thought they only did things like that in Wuthering Heights, which by the way, no one wants to read. But no, Fitzgerald is a master, he just lays everything out on the line. Beautifully constructed sentences, beautiful everything. I can't even comprehend everything, and I think I need to read it twice."
1564,مروان البلوشي,"وأخيراً وصلت لنهاية ""غاتسبي العظيم""، انتهيت من قراءتها هذا الصباح في تمام السادسة والنصف. ولقد شعرت بصباح جديد هذه المرة يختلف كلياً عن كل الصباحات السابقة.أريد أن أراجع نفسي، حياتي كاملة، أراجع كل أطماعي و طموحاتي وأوهامي، أريد أن اتأمل شخصيتي بكل ما فيها من صفات جيدة وسيئة وما بينهما.هذه هي قوة الأدب العظيم.أنصح بقراءتها باللغة الإنجليزية فقط.It’s hard to comprehend this novel without reading it in English, For it has a poetic quality which is hard to transfer to Arabic. It seems to me, though, that no American novel comes closer than ""Gatsby"" to surpassing literary artistry, and none tells us more about America. In an extraordinarily compressed space -- the novel is barely 50,000 words long -- Fitzgerald gives us a meditation on some of America’s most central ideas, themes, yearnings and preoccupations: ""the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder."""
1565,Asma Fedosia,"Amazing novel set in the 1920's Jazz Age Long Island, New York. The story centers on a World War I hero Jay Gatsby, who returning penniless becomes rich through improper business dealings and seeks out his former girlfriend Daisy Buchanan. Interest level runs high for the plot, for the scathing depiction of how fickle characters can befriend then can coldly mistreat one another, and for the depiction of Gatsby's magnificent, nightly parties to woo back Daisy. The ending hints at a sad commentary on the course of history in a real and metaphorical valley of ashes since the first sight of green forests and its accompanying hopes for a new world. "
1566,Iris,"The twenties are also called ""The Roaring Twenties"" or ""The Gilded Age"" because prosperity flourished in those times. Various classes existed and co-existed during this decade like I mentioned before: the established rich, the newly rich, and the poor. But, of course, there was also a middle-class. (quoted)In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. ""Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,"" he told me, ""just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."" (1.1-2)By carefully setting up the book into distinct classes, the book draws out that each class has its own problems to deal with, and leave us a question of what the world really is. Scott successfully create distinct social classes — old money/new money/and no money —sending strong messages about the elitism running throughout every strata of society. The whole book also offers a variety of themes — justice, power, greed, betrayal, the American dream and so on. This is a great book that worth repeatedly reading! Love it!"
1567,Leif Taylor-white,"The Great Gatsby, a classic novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, presents itself through the protagonist Jay Gatsby. With most all works of Fitzgerald, the story was well written and cleverly thought out. The main purpose and story line behind the book, was that Mr. Jay Gatsby, a mysterious man, was seeking the affection of a certain women by the name of Daisy Buchanan. With the limitless luxuries that Gatsby possessed with his incredible fortune, the plot turns into this mysterious romance, in my mind relating closest to the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet.For me, the reason this story is classed as brilliantly written, is for the character detail that portrays the beauty and horror of human interaction. With the misunderstandings and pure jealously that leads to hatred and murder, our attention is cultivated towards the genuine. This is why I personally admired the story of Gatsby himself. His single intention of creating the sparks he felt in a woman he used to know brings a cleaner, more pure story, where the rest of the world is flocking to Gatsby’s crazy house parties. For this reason, it really illuminates the shallowness of those with less noble intentions.The really striking point that made Gatsby’s story all the more real for me was the idea of the green light. In my mind, this symbolized a greater type of motivation that could be applied to almost any goal. Seeing the light made his dreams real, and in this he found his solace, his purest of motives. Speaking on different level from the typical love story gone wrong; this book made me think of what we as people hold dearest. Seeing the general public so infatuated with a shallow happiness created by wild times made me rethink the idea of creating memories to look back on. The novel emphasizes that it’s not so much about the memories of good times, but more creating opportunities for a more meaningful pleasure; one that can accompany our lives forever, the idea of fulfilling a dream.The only real thing I wish I could have changed about my perception of the book, was the mistake of watching the movie first. Although well-constructed, all the movie brought me was an occurring theme of “A little party never killed nobody” that distracted me from the characters of the story. What Fitzgerald really creates here, is an eye opener to the shallow disease of our lives that occurs when we fail to chase our dreams. "
1568,Kara,"I really loved this book. This novel takes place in New York City during the 1920s, a.k.a. the Roaring Twenties. The novel includes an entangling of relationships that brings all the characters together. Fitzgerald's novel teaches many important lesson about being wealthy, friendship and love. One lesson I learned is, being rich is not the best thing in the world because when you are rich, it is hard to tell whether your friends are ""true"" friends or are they friends because of the money (taking an advantage). Not only friendship, but also with love. It would be hard to determine whether your lover loves you for who you actually are or just for your money (gold-digger)."
1569,Melissa Ridenour,"I had read F.Scott Fitzgerald’s novel, The Great Gatsby, many years ago. In anticipation of the release of the new film version of the book, however, I decided to read it again. The movie trailers promoting the new film seem grand, dramatic, and intense. The previews also seem to suggest the story is shocking and brutal. In reality, Fitzgerald’s novel is simple and almost lyrical. It remains to be seen if the new film version captures the same essence of what I consider to be among Fitzgerald’s best novels.The events of the novel are filtered through the consciousness of its narrator, Nick Carraway. He is a young Yale graduate who moves to New York and rents a house next door to the mansion of the quite eccentric millionaire, Jay Gatsby. Carraway seems to be a part of, and yet separate from, the world he describes. Gatsby hosts an extravagant party at his elegant mansion to which all the great of the young and fashionable world come and are in awe of Gatsby’s wealth and extravagance. They also exchange gossip and speculation about Gatsby’s murky past. Despite Gatsby’s extravagant lifestyle, he remains dissatisfied. Nick Carraway discovers why. If you have not yet read Fitzgerald novel, I won’t be a spoiler as to the things that Carraway discovers about Gatsby’s past.Fitzgerald crafted the novel as a series of slow burning time bombs. While reading the book, I simultaneously wanted them to go off to relieve the pressure and the curiosity but, yet, not to go off, so that I could savor a little longer the slow unraveling of the plot. What makes the book so lyrical is the first person narration in which Fitzgerald effortlessly makes it seem to interweave insightful internal thoughts and commentary between observation, dialogue and plot.If you haven’t yet read the novel and you plan to see the new film, I highly recommend that you read the novel first. It will be time well-spent."
1570,Postcards far away,"Il grande FitzgeraldPrima premessa: non guardate il film di Luhrmann prima di aver letto il libro, come ho fatto io, me tapina.Questo è un libro che va gustato parola per parola. Fitzgerald usa quest'ultime come care vecchie amanti che continuano a cercarlo e cercarlo.Una storia ""d'amore"" viene raccontata da Nick Carraway, colui che poi diventerà (l'unico) amico di Gatsby, un potente ricco abitante di West Egg, proprietario di una villa sfarzosissima che mette ""a disposizione"" ogni week end per feste lussuose affogate nell'alcol, nelle risa e nei valzer della sua orchestra.Ma il sogno di Gatsby non è la fama con cui si nutre (e diciamocelo, ci paga pure i conti dei suoi party), bensì è Daisy, dolce fanciulla (stupida) da lui amata anni prima che lei si sposasse con Tom Buchanan.Si ritrovano, si riamano e ciascuno dei protagonisti tirerà le somme assieme a Gatsby e Daisy della propria vita e dei propri sentimenti.Mi fermo qua, sennò lo spoiler è assicurato!E' il primo libro di Fitzgerald che leggo e mi chiedo perchè io non l'abbia fatto prima.Quest'autore è un maestro con le parole, la storia scorre via come un puro piacere seppur nella sua semplicità.Questo libro è un ritratto degli anni Venti in America che mi ha fatto catapultare fra i charleston e furfanti, quindi mi sento sicuramente di consigliare questa lettura!!(Anche la visione del film di Luhrmann, stranamente!)"
1571,Christina Wang,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The language used was extraordinary, the way Fitzgerald described the scenery and ambiance is forever embedded in my mind. The story was a good one but the language above all, in my opinion, made this book. The writing style and text made it all the more exciting.Re read it and it is officially my favourite book.- July 27"
1572,Joshua Bertram,"The titular Gatsby -- even the title is ironic -- was a man ahead of his time. It is that utterly contemporary vibe given off by Fitzgerald's masterpiece that makes the novel so enduring. The juxtaposition of the extravagant lifestyle of Gatsby with narrator and everyman Nick Carraway's open disdain for the glamour and excess is both the very heart of Fitzgerald's scathing critique of the lie of the American Dream, and a mirror of contemporary culture's obsession with tragic exess and the popularity of reality television stars like the Kardashians and the Real Housewives of Anywhere. Brilliant. Can't wait for the movie. "
1573,Joel Donlon,"Re-read recently due to the the Joseph O'Neill Netherland comparisons:Fresh Air from WHYY, July 2, 2008 · The strategy is so obvious, so inevitable, you wonder why it took so long for a writer to carry it out. I'm talking about the idea to write a novel about post-Sept. 11 New York City as viewed through the scrim of F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece, The Great Gatsby. Gatsby is the great American novel about dreaming, overreaching and loss, but many people forget that it's also a great novel about New York City, which stands in for the idea of America in the novel. "
1574,afra,"Though this book takes place in an age far before my time, its themes of materialism, illusion and disillusion, and displacement all hit close to home. That was certainly not the case when I read this book for an English class at age 16. Thank goodness I revisited it."
1575,Tyler,"INTRO TO REVIEW. BLARGHWe are a nation that believes in the american dream: we pride ourselves on our lack of aristocracy and the equality of opportunity, but Gatsby is a novel about our de facto aristocracy and the limits of American opportunity. I mean, Daisy Buchanan, You're not supposed to like her at least not in the uncomplicated way that you like, say, cupcakes. I don't know where the idea that the quality of a novel should be judged by the likeability of its characters, but let me submit to you that Daisy Buchannan doesn't have to be likeable to be interesting. Furthermore what makes her unlikeable- her sense of entitlement, her limited empathy, her inability to make difficult choices- are some of the exact things that make YOU unlikeable. Thats the pleasure and challenge of reading great novels: You get to see yourself as others see you, and you get to see others as they see themselves. ACTUAL REVIEW: SPOILERS AHEAD: From the first chapter, we know three things about our narrator Nick Carraway- by the way, get it, Care away? It's not that sophisticated he could have done better. 1. Nick grew up in the Midwest, then moved to New York's West Egg, and then something happened that made him move back to the Midwest. 2. He is prone of the use of high-falutin language as when he introduces Jay Gastsby by saying, ""Gatsby turned out alright in the end; it was what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men."" That dream by the way, with all of its foul dust, is the American dream. Finally 3. Nick is rich, and he got rich not by working, but by having a rich ancestor who paid someone off to serve in the civil war on his behalf, which allowed Nick's ancestor to spend the Civil War making money. So how's that for equal opportunity? And then there's Gatsby about whom we learned absolutely about in this chapter except for the foul dust and that he had an extraordinary gift for hope. This extraordinary gift for hope is the essential fact of gatsby and also many romantic leads. Then you have the aggresively vapid Daisy Buchanan, Nick's distant cousin, who lives across the bay from Gatsby and Nick in the much more fashionable East Egg, Daisy is crazy rich, like polo pony rich! thanks to her marriage to Tom Buchanan,Tom is a former football player and lifelong asshat, who Nick describes as ""one of those men who achieved such an acute, limited excellence at 21 that everything afterwards savors of anti-climax."" BURN. So soon after the novel begins, Daisy and Tom ask Nick to come over for dinner, where the golfer Jordan Baker is also there, and they have this awful party. and there's this great moment when Tom goes on a racist rant, that says, ""We're nordics and we've produced all the things that make a civilization."" which is hilarious because none of those people has actually produced anything: they didn't make the fancy furniture they're sitting on, they didn't grow or cook the food they're eating; they don't even light they're own freaking candles! We also learn that Tom has a mistress, and that Daisy might not be as stupid as she's letting on, because she looks at her young daughter and famously says, "" I hope shell be a fool, thats the best thing a girl can be, a beautiful little fool. It's difficult to argue that Daisy is a good person after all in the novel's climax, she allows Gatsby to take the fall for something she did. But she's a product of a much older American system, one that, for instance, allows rich people to pay poor people to go fight wars for them. Also as a side note, everything Gatsby owns is yellow (pretty much it's a running theme) which reminds me of wealth, and to a lesser extent, decay. Anyway from that dinner party its obvious that wealth consumes the rich, but there's a moment when it becomes clear that wealth consumes the poor. Daisy tells a story about her butler, that he used to polish silver for a big family in the city night and day until the caustic silver polish ruined his nose. So whenever Nick is hanging out with the mega-rich Tom, the parties are always awful, and everybody always wants the kind of status and wealth that he has, which is hilarious because of course Tom is a horrible asshat who makes Paris Hilton look charming and grounded. But then we get to go to some awesome parties at Gatsby's house on West Egg, and even though Gatsby has the annoying habit of saying ""old sport"" all the time and trying to sound upper-crusty, he's totally charming: He has a smile that makes you feel he is irresistibly prejudiced in your favor, the first party at Gatsby's house also contains, despite being set during Prohibition, the greastest drunk driving scene in the history of American literature. To Fitzgerald, that had become the American Dream by the 1920's: Everyone wanted enough money to buy fancy cars and enough whiskey to crash them. But Gatsby, tellingly, doesn't drink. He's never even used his pool- well until the very end of the novel. All the money he has acquired and all the parties he throws, are about one thing only: Winning back Daisy Buchanan. The most famous color symbol in The Great Gatsby is the green light out at the end of Daisy's dock, that Gatsby is always looking at from across the bay. He just wants to reach across the bay and reach that green light because he believes if he can, he might have the girl- and the life that has driven his wild ambition. Nick calls the light at one point an enchanted object and thats what symbols reallly are. The green light is a symbol in Gatsby. As the green light is an enchanted object, the gold and yellow are enchanted colors in Gatsby, and also in real life: golden opportunities, golden youth, golden ages. Gold is the color that conflates wealth and beauty. In Gatsby, it's a bit different. Yellow is not only the oclor of wealth but also of death. Myrtle's house is yellow, the eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleberg, which stare over so much death in the novel in so many ways, are ringed in yellow glasses. Gatsby's car, the fatal missile, is yellow. The last chapter of the Great Gatsby is one of the saddest passages in American literature, showing how difficult it is to distinguish between guilt and innocence, and how intractably unfair our society is, even if we don't have Barons and Duchesses. Some people argue that Gatsby couldn't live the American dream because he didnt come by his money honestly, but who in the novel did come by their money honestly? Also you can argue that nothing is ever enough for Gatsby, it's not enough for Daisy to love him; she must also say that she never loved Tom. THE BIG QUESTION: WAS GATSBY GREAT?The language of the novel elevates Gatsby's triumphs and tragedies to the stuff of real epics, which gives Gatsby a kind of unironic greatness. Remember you don't have to be good to be great. It is truly great by virtue of Gatsby's capacity to commit himself to his aspirations. We celebrate our successes when they come from hard work and labor because there's a greatness in that success that you don't get by lounging around and using your pool all the time. Remember there is only one person at his parties that doesn't get drunk: himself! hes a bootlegger that doesnt drink and a pool owner that doesnt swim. The adjective great indicates the tawdry and exaggerated aspects of his life. I can see him being introduced as:Hurry Hurry Hurry! Step right up to see the GREAT GATSBY! I mean hes part magician and- in a world of wealth- hes part carnival curiosity. His car is even referred to as a clown car. Gatsby is obsessed with controlling time but Gatsby doesn't just want to marry Daisy, he wants her to say that she never loved Tom at all, as if he can erase the past five years. What theyll do about her baby is a fascinating question that gatsby seems wholly uninterested in. Gatsby's most famous line supports his obsession with time saying ""Can't repeat the past? Why of course you can. I'm going to fix everything just the way it was before."" Gatsby believes the key to the beautiful future is a perfect restoration of the beautiful past. Gatsby has both literally and figuratively made a name for himself. Gatsby lives in a cold world that cares nothing for justice, it makes claims to fairness but really only further rewards those who have already been rewarded. I mean, who even survives this novel? Only the idle rich: Jordan Baker, Daisy, Tom, and Nick. They survive and they are allowed to go on being careless. They aren't cruel or malicious, just careless. They dont care about myrtle or gatsby or their daughter or even each other. Fitzgerald shows us the horror of a care-free life, how Tom and Daisy's not caring is in some ways more monstrous than outright cruelty would be. It's not like in Romeo and Juliet where the lovers are sacrificed and then Verona is healed. Nothing is made whold by the tragedy of the great gatsby. Thats why some readers find the novel depressing and hopeless, but i dont think it is because of that line in the first chapter ""Gatsby turned out alright in the end."" As individuals, and as a collective, the tragedy isn't in dreaming;its in chasing an unworthy dream. So, is gatsby great? I'm interested to others point of view but here's my takeaway: Jay Gatsby was a great man. But great people especially must be careful about what they worship."
1576,Pamela,"Wow...this book was great!!! I'll never forget the lines in which the Great Gasby and Daisy were in his bedroom, and he was showing her his vast array of shirts, and it's at that moment that she truly realizes what she gave up...loved it!!!"
1577,Mikayla Choat,"This book was excellent! Unlike the movie, the book gives you more of a look into the minds of the characters especially that of Nick Carraway. If you find the roaring twenties and partying interesting, then you will definitely find this book entertaining and easy to read. This book is a party book about a rich guy who has a lot of them, but it does show the romance between him and Daisy Buchanan. She is the whole reason he has these parties just show she might show up one day! That is commitment! She acts like she loves him but there is a twist. Her husband is a jerk and a real womanizer and Nick is a little boring but his character does tell the story well. I guarantee that you will fall in love with this book for the flow of it too. Some times I thought I was going to just fall asleep because of the nice and flowing tone to it. At least, that is how I felt. Another reason to read this book is that it teaches you to not judge a book by its cover. Daisy looks all sweet and innocent but you need to read the book to understand the pure hatred I have for that woman. Anyways, read this book! You will definitely love it!"
1578,Brandi,"Love, Love, Love this book! Strangely I even liked the movies."
1579,Michelle Geiger,I could read this every year. 
1580,Brandy,"I do not recall reading The Great Gatsby while in school. Although I am sure it must have been a required read (I probably had ""better"" things to do as a teen than read a novel. ha!). I am only sorry that it took me so long to finally get to it. This truly is a wonderful classic and a new favorite that I will read many times over. As some of the other reviewers point out, there is a beautiful rhythm to Fitzgerald's writing style, extremely descriptive, yet done in simple dialogue. This is a classic that still stands up in modern day society, especially the unscrupulous characters."
1581,Haley Davis,"Haley DavisMr. BittoEnglish 8F31 May 2013 Good Reads Review: The Great GatsbyIs it better to be a person who captivates others into getting everything you desire or be an intellectual realist who understands failure? In The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Nick Carraway, Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchannan are all living it up at extravagant parties in the 1920’s. Despite being surrounded by blaring jazz music and fascinating people from around the world, each of them must still deal with their own personal desires. Being either charming or intellectual, Nick, Daisy, and Jay have admirable characteristics that are revealed in an extraordinary way; however, some of these characteristics have flaws as well.Nick Carraway, a rather unsuccessful businessman, knows the true value of failure, which has allowed him to look at the situations in an objective way. When Jay, who was head over heels in love with Daisy, was planning to make Daisy fall in love with him again, Nick reminded him, “I wouldn’t ask too much of her…you can’t repeat the past” (110). Nick knows from failure in his business life that things can go wrong easily and had to help Gatsby remember that not everything will always play out in his favor. Although Nick wants the best for Jay, he is just looking out for him because he has a broad view of the situation at hand.Jay Gatsby, an unbelievably wealthy man, has an extraordinarily charming personality that persuades people to give him what he longs for. When Nick Carraway met Jay for the first time, he was astounded by Gatsby’s enchanting smile. He thought, “ It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced-or seemed to face- the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor” (48). Gatsby’s charm often tends to play to his advantage. His smile is a special attribute that helps entrance others to provide his desires. Since he almost always achieves his ambitions, he has an unbridled optimism encompassing all that periodically leads him to dream too big. Daisy Buchanan, a young married woman with money to burn, has an endearing way of communicating with people. When Nick Carraway visited Daisy at her house, he was captivated by her at once. “She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had” (8). Because of Daisy’s splendor and her personal charm, Nick’s attention is drawn by her in a matter of seconds. Virtually everyone finds Daisy appealing, but with so much attention comes a negative aspect. She has trouble choosing between the people she loves.So which attribute is of greater benefit in the end, charm or realism? Ultimately, I think it would be better to be a realistic person. Charm sometimes leads to receiving many things you desire, but eventually your optimism will blind you. Over time your dreams will expand, and once a goal is not obtained, it will be a much greater disappointment. Being realistic will enable you to not get your hopes up too high, because nothing in life is ever guaranteed. "
1582,Christopher,"I felt like rereading this, having read the THE LAST TYCOON and Baz Luhrman's upcoming movie and all. For about five years I have called this my favorite book. When I read it as a teenager, I was going through some kind of existential crisis feeling separate from the self-indulgence of American adolescence. I even experienced what it must have been like as Nick Carraway, with my own ""Gatsby"" pursuing his own Golden Girl. This is a role I have played often in life, offering harsh advice (""It'll never work out."" ""Get over it."" ""You're better off.""), so THE GREAT GATSBY became my favorite book from my passivity to my own generation.But it wasn't the memories that made me love the book. It was a small passage where we get Gatsby's point-of-view. In vivid description we learn about the young Daisy and how Gatsby was taken by her presence and desirability. Maybe it is the years for me, but somehow the tragedy of the story finally leapt out of the pages. I no longer felt like scoffing off the ridiculousness of the characters. Instead I was taken by their foolishness. I felt sorry for what it did to them.I do still consider this my favorite book. I'm glad I can still say that."
1583,Carissa,"Ah, one of the Great American Novels. I think to read this book, you must dive in knowing that it is not a fast paced story, despite its small size. I think it helps to know that the characters, though realistic and interesting studies, are not easy to sympathize with at all. I know the focus is usually on Gatsby, but I find Nick Carraway to be interesting because I find myself almost forgetting about him AS he narrates the story! He seems bleak and boring next the other characters. Which made it hard to remember much about him and relate to him, but also made it easy for me to focus on the dynamics of the other characters. It was not until the last part of the story that I felt his presence more.Fitzgerald builds up a dream (namely Gatsby's), and then smashes it into tiny shards. The progression of that always intrigued me, HOW it happened and WHY it happened. Reading it the second time around I definitely appreciated the characters and what was happening to them much more. There is so much to pull out of this book.Also, I would recommend reading/watching analysis of The Great Gatsby (or any classic novel really). It helps me to think more critically about what I'm reading. I really liked these two videos. Although I would watch them AFTER reading it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw9Au...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn0WZ..."
1584,Marina,"Часто я слышу отзывы о Фицжеральде в духе ""переоценный автор, ничего сверх вау в его книгах нету"". Как по мне, его книги похожи на большой торт - коржи смысла и идей, прослойки персонажей и образов, красивая глазурь в виде языка и специфический вкус междувоенной эпохи. Именно в многослойности и есть вся соль творчества Фицжеральда - если читаешь вскользь, невнимательно или особо не вдумываясь, то пробуешь только глазурь. А вот если задумаешься и доходишь до коржей, то понимаешь, насколько трагичны и грустны его книги. ""Великий Гэтсби"" это именно очень грустная книга. Вообще литература Потерянного Поколения несет на себе большое бремя грусти и печали, хотя и пытается скрыть ее вечеринками и джазом. Гэтсби как персонаж такой же многослойный - загадочный хозяин большой виллы, непонятно зачем устраивающей вечеринки, непонятно чего добивающийся, непонятно откуда взявшийся. А на самом деле это человек с четкой целью и планом ее достижения. Когда читала книгу первый раз, Гэтсби мне казался простым разбогатевшим человеком, который устраивал вечеринки по положенному ему статусу исключительно для Дейзи. Сейчас мне кажется, что была в этом и доля самовосхваления, в особенности когда он хвастался гостями перед Дейзи, и доля боязни одиночества, но все же была и доля желания доказать Дейзи и всему миру, что он достоин барышни из высшего света. Но Гэтсби так и остался бедным парнишей, плюс еще и сам образ Дейзи в своей голове довел до совершенства, не понимая, что она-то - не более чем пустоголовый придаток-к-мужу. Финал книги для меня - логичен на все сто. Стремление к американской мечте заканчивается или успехом, или вот так, как Гэтсби. Get rich or die tryin', как говорили по этому поводу в нулевые. И именно вот это стремление к мечте - и есть тот самый тонкий неуловимый ингредиент праздничного торта ""Гэтсби"", который так тяжело распробовать с набегу, но без которого торт не будет шедевром."
1585,Rafael Baglio," F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby was a story I would have never read if I did't see the 2013 movie. I started reading the book in September and I had to reading at least a chapter a night for the first week. My favorite part of the is when Fitzgerald uses his description skills to describe the grandness of Gatsby's house and the city. Also the phrase used by Gatsby "" Good Old Sport"" stuck out to me. I felt the characters were real with their situations which made them feel real to me. Gatsby was a dark and secretive character to me about his past and present. Nick Carraway was just a real genuine kid trying to find his place in the big city. The setting of the story takes place the summer of 1922 in Long Island, New York were Nick crosses Gatsby path as his neighbor. The 20's were all about celebration and prohibition after WWI which effects the mood the story dramatically. The themes of the story are about finding your place. The first theme is to always love someone no matter what. The second is the difference between social classes and the role of symbols in the human conception of meaning."
1586,Bianey Douglas,"The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a whirlwind of emotions, truth, and love. The Great Gatsby is about Gatsby, a wealthy man in love with an unattainable woman, Daisy, who is married to another man. Gatsby is very passionate about Daisy and does everything he possibly can to gain Daisy's love. I have read and read and read this novel over and over again, it makes me cry, laugh, and dream. I definitely recommend The Great Gatsby to anyone who is fond of historical fiction, romance, and poetry. The words Fitzgerald uses read like water bubbling in a brook. The characters aren't very likable, (except for Gatsby, Readers will absolutely love and connect with his emotions and actions) but I believe that the point of this novel is to warn us about what we are doing to ourselves and to society, how we treat others and how that affects the world around us. The point of view of the story makes it even more enticing.mThis book is powerful, inspirational and just straight out beautiful, it's a true treasure to our library of American literature. "
1587,Laure Parkinson,"It only takes me about five pages to remember why The Great Gatsby is so timeless. “This is a valley of ashes.” Whether one’s drowned in a crowd of overwhelmingly wealthy aristocrats or poor students in the mid-nineteen-twenties or the turn of the twentieth century, the depths of a collective group are pretty shallow. Fitzgerald reminds us that for every single contemplative, intelligent person there are myriads of superficial ones sucking them dry. Similarly, whether in a feudal society (which Fitzgerald recalls in the “feudal silhouette” of Gatsby’s mansion, 96) or at the height of American capitalism, only two things matter: money and status, whether in the form of gold or material possessions.The characters, so materially successful, fail miserably with the communication of feelings and ideas. The tense scene between Daisy and Gatsby at Nick’s house illustrates their incompetence at elucidating their feelings–something far more real than their possessions, in which they have no problem finding immediate value and gratification. They confront each other with “counterfeit ease” and have to stabilize themselves “physically” or hide among shadows in order to conceal a mental instability (92). In Nick’s discomfort, he has to flee outside to escape the restraints of society represented by his own house. Similarly, nothing ever sparks between Jordan and Nick because their relationship is characterized by this sort of impotency that lies in her scorn of his comparative poverty—her “urban distaste for the concrete” (54)—and his revulsion towards her jaunty but dishonest personality.But equally important as (and in relationship with) his critique of the social system is his critique of capitalism, or perhaps more specifically the American Dream. The story of the “Great” Gatsby is not merely a tragic love story, but the collapse of the American man. In the third to last paragraph of the novel, Nick recalls the “old island here that flowered once for the Dutch sailor’s eyes–a fresh green breast of the new world” (189): the land of abundant resources that represented a new, untapped potential for wealth. He immediately follows up with the image of “its vanished trees…that made way for Gatsby’s house.” He shows how the forces of man, his power lying in control of material possessions, have run over nature–including, but not limited to, love. “He must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream…A new world, material without being real” (169)–and it is at this point Gatsby dies. Gatsby must die at the height of his material success, as the most powerful and wealthy character in the novel. If he doesn’t die directly from capitalism, it is all the social implications and roads he must take to attain this that bring him to his death.Fitzgerald’s play with natural light versus electricity shows people’s struggles to command their own world, their own sources of light. Yet when they do, such as when Gatsby shuts himself away from the storm during his joyful reunion with Daisy, it is because the characters are either consciously or unconsciously protecting themselves from some harsh reality. Similarly, he plays with light and darkness: characters shun themselves from the exterior–especially natural light–while seeming to find “enlightenment” in the darkness.Only Carraway realizes how indefinite are the figures and objects in the shadows. And the most intangible figure of all, the one to whom we are introduced as “a figure [that:] had emerged from the shadow of [his:] mansion” (25), is Gatsby himself, and “the colossal vitality of his illusion” (101). We all live in Nick’s–or Gatsby’s–world, but we all occupy different characters."
1588,Γιώτα Παπαδημακοπούλου,"Όταν το μυθιστόρημα του Fitzgerald εκδόθηκε το 1925, δεν βρήκε την αναγνώριση που του άξιζε. Πολλές οι συμπτώσεις και τα γεγονότα, κοινωνικά και πολιτικά, που μεσολάβησαν και έτσι, η προσοχή στράφηκε σε αυτά και ο κόσμος, δε είχε τη διάθεση να ασχοληθεί μαζί του και να του δώσει, την πρέπουσα σημασία. Όμως τα μεγάλα έργα, τελικά, βρίσκουν το δρόμο τους, ακόμα κι αν χρειαστεί να περάσει καιρός για να αναγνωριστούν και η ιστορία του Fitzgerald, είναι μία από αυτές. Σήμερα, η ιστορία του ""Υπέροχου Γκάτσμπυ"" θεωρείται ένα από τα κορυφαία αριστουργήματα της αγγλόφωνης λογοτεχνίας του 20ου αιώνα και όχι άδικα καθώς, μέσα από τις σελίδες του, εκφράζεται η ιδεολογία και τα συναισθήματα του αμερικάνικου λαού, σε μια εποχή ματαιοδοξίας και ψευδαισθήσεων που δεν περίμενε τις εξελίξεις που θα ακολουθούσαν και θα άλλαζαν, τα πάντα.Η ιστορία του Γκάτσμπυ, είναι μια ιστορία έρωτα και αγάπης, αφοσίωσης και πίστης, σε σχέσεις, ιδανικά και αξίες, που είναι όμως χτισμένα πάνω σε χαλάσματα, στην ουτοπική φαντασίωση της ολοκλήρωσης και κατάκτησης του ανέφικτου. Ό,τι κάνει ο Γκάτσμπυ, προέρχεται από την απεγνωσμένη του επιθυμία να κατακτήσει τον έρωτα που έχασε και όμως, παρά τα χρόνια που μεσολάβησαν από τη γέννησή του, δεν έσβησε αλλά αντίθετα, μεγάλωσε και φούντωσε και τελικά, τον οδήγησε στο φαινομενικό απόγειο και την καταστροφή του. Ο έρωτάς του για την Νταίζυ, ειλικρινής και απόλυτος, ολοκληρωτικά δοσμένος σε εκείνη χωρίς να ζητάει τίποτα περισσότερο από όλα εκείνα που κάποτε του έταζε. Και εκείνη, γοητευμένη και παραδομένη σε όλα όσα τις προσέφερε, χωρίς ωστόσο να δίνει την ψυχή της γιατί στο βάθος της ψυχής της, αν ποτέ είχε τέτοια, ήταν δεσμευμένη με άλλα πράγματα, λιγότερο σημαντικά και όμως, στα δικά της μάτια, απόλυτα σπουδαία.Ο Fitzgerald αφηγείται μέσα από τα μάτια ενός τρίτου την ιστορία του Γκάτσμπυ που είναι ο απόλυτος εκπρόσωπος μια χαμένης γενιάς, μιας γενιάς που πίστευε πως έχει τη δύναμη να κατακτήσει τον κόσμο, που πίστευε ότι τα είχε καταφέρει. Και όμως, η γενιά αυτή, δεν είχε νικητές, μονάχα χαμένους στο βωμό μιας δόξας που όσο γρήγορα ήρθε, άλλο τόσο γρήγορα έσβησε. Μιας γενιάς που πίστευε πως είχε κατακτήσει τα πάντα ενώ στην πραγματικότητα, δεν είχε κατακτήσει τίποτα απλώς, είχε ξεκλέψει μερικές στιγμές αναγνωρισιμότητας, πολυτέλειας, έρωτα, άκαιρης φήμης και που ζούσε με την ψευδαίσθηση πως κάτω από το πέπλο όλων αυτών, μπορούσε να κρύψει την αλήθεια. Όμως η αλήθεια, όσο κι αν προσπαθούμε, δεν μένει κρυφή για πολύ, όχι όταν όλα γύρω μας συνηγορούν στο να αποδοθεί δικαίωση, έστω κι αν δεν είναι ολοκληρωτική και απόλυτη.Οι χαρακτήρες του Fitzgerald είναι ολοκληρωμένοι, ειλικρινώς σκιαγραφημένοι, απόλυτοι εκπρόσωποι της εποχής όπου το αμερικάνικο όνειρο, δεν θυμίζει σε τίποτα την σημερινή, ευτελή έννοια που το έχει αποδοθεί. Ο Γκάτσμπυ, ζει για την δικαίωση του έρωτα, αγαπώντας τον έρωτα και όλα όσα εκείνος συμβολίζει στα μάτια του. Η Νταίζυ πάλι, ζει για την ίδια τη ζωή. Είναι η προσωποποίηση της αυταρέσκειας, ένας άνθρωπος που με το πέρασμα των χρόνω, έχασε όποια αθωότητα μπορεί να είχε κάποτε, παραδομένη στην χλιδή και την πολυτέλεια, ένας άνθρωπος που δεν θέλει να δώσει τίποτα και παράλληλα, θέλει να της δίνουν τα πάντα, όχι γιατί πραγματικά το αξίζει αλλά γιατί, πιστεύει ότι το αξίζει, χωρίς να υπολογίζει τις συνέπειες για τους άλλους. Και οι δυο του μαζί, εκπροσωπούν τις πτυχές ενός συλλογικού ονείρου, του ονείρου ενός λαού, ενός κόσμου, μιας εποχής που έσβησε, όπως ακριβώς γεννήθηκε και τελικά, χάθηκε στη λήθη των χαμένων ψευδαισθήσεων, πληρώνοντας τις επιλογές του.Το βιβλίο αυτό, είναι ένας ύμνος στη ζωή που κάποιοι ήθελαν να έχουν την ίδια στιγμή που ζούσαν μια εντελώς διαφορετική, προσπαθώντας να διεκδικήσουν το όνειρό τους. Είναι ένα ύμνος στις ανθρώπινες επιθυμίες και στην εθελοτυφλία μας απέναντι σε αυτά που δεν θέλουμε να δούμε, που πιστεύουμε πως είναι διαφορετικά απ' ότι είναι στην πραγματικότητα. Και ο Γκάτσμπυ, είναι ένας πραγματικά υπέροχος άνθρωπος, που αφήνεται και παρασύρεται και τελικά, πληρώνει πολύ ακριβά το τίμημα, φτάνοντας σε ένα αδιέξοδο τέλος χωρίς επιστροφή, έχοντας γευτεί μερικές στιγμές ενός παρελθόντος που νοσταλγούσε και όμως, δεν μπορούσε να υπάρξει στα αλήθεια. Είναι ο ύμνος στην ελπίδα και τον ρομαντισμό μιας εποχής που πέρασε και χάθηκε, αφήνοντας πίσω της έργα όπως αυτά για να μας θυμίζουν πως κάποτε υπήρξε. Και πραγματικά, είναι πολύ κρίμα που ο Fitzgerald δεν έζησε αρκετά για να δει το μυθιστόρημά του να απογειώνεται και να μένει στην ιστορία, γραμμένο με χρυσά, ένδοξα γράμματα και εμείς, πολύ τυχεροί που έχουμε αυτή τη δυνατότητα."
1589,Stephanie Sykes,"I enjoyed the book “The Great Gatsby” by F. Scott Fitzgerald, because I didn’t really know what will happened. A man named Nick moved to New York to learn about businesses connecting. He moves next door to a guy named Gatsby and Gatsby threw a lot of parties. The story was told in first person by Nick. The main characters were: Nick, Gatsby, Daisy, and Tom. Nick was related to Daisy and he moved to New York to learn about business. Gatsby was in love with Daisy and he was a rich man. Daisy was Gatsby lover and she promised she would wait for him. Tom was married to Daisy. The story takes place in East and West Egg in the 1920's. West Egg was were the new rich people lived and East Egg was were the old rich people lived. The parties were taken place at Gatsby house. The two themes in “The Great Gatsby” was love and different kinds of class. Love was one of the themes, because Gatsby really loves Daisy and she was willing to wait for him. I could also see the love between Tom and Daisy. The different kinds of class was the other theme, because there was West and East Egg. I would recommend this book to high school students, because I thought this book was a little bit hard to read. I would recommend this book to both genders, because I don’t think this book focus just on one gender. I really enjoyed this book, because I like learning and seeing what other people lived. "
1590,Shreya,"Stunning! Watched the movie prior to reading this book (slightly backwards?) The Great Gatsby is a book you will never get tired of reading. I'm forever thankful of my friend that recommended this. Now I'm recommending to YOU, old sport ;). A book which wraps parties, money, affairs, a failed relationship, women and death. Mr Gatsby was smart, MYSTERIOUS, handsome and wealthy. MY FAVORITE CHARACTER, besides Gatsby, was Jordan Baker. The ""slender, small-breasted girl."" A professional athlete, a friend of Daisy's and also clever. It seemed Jordan knew all the gossip: Tom's affair, Gatsby. In the movie I found Jordan extremely gorgeous. The Great Gatsby, a classic. "
1591,Bianca Carrizal,"Wow. Although my heart is not satisfied with the ending, this has been one of the best books I've ever read. It was very intense throughout the story; from Nick's opening line, the holocaust, and to ending. The use of literary devices by Fitzgerald are incredible. Every color, every character, every semicolon and comma are all useful and no accident. The underlying themes of love, lust, power, and obsession leads to the overall idea that the American Dream is long behind us, and we will never be truly satisfied because the desire to have more changes your identity and your motives. You lose yourself along the way to try and make yourself better "
1592,Darcy,"There is a reason some novels are considered classics, and I can't believe it took me so long to discover Fitzgerald. He had a talent for making people totally dissimilar from me seem to be very sympathetic and understandable. I consider the central character to be the most tragic hero, the romance to be the most hopeless, and the heroine to be the most selfish I have ever encountered in literature. It was just a monumental work. I don't cry much at all, but I did when this book was over. It was totally different than my preconceptions."
1593,Megan Francis,"“ Gatsby turned out all right in at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men” (2).Admired as one of the twentieth century’s greatest classical literature, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby has earned its acclaim. While a shallow reading may leave readers with nothing, critical reading shows a story full of symbols, theme and complex ideas. Jay Gatsby is the rich and enigmatic neighbor of Nick Carraway- the narrator. Nick is fascinated with the mystery of Gatsby and soon becomes involved with Gatsby’s journey to reclaim a long ago love. Daisy Buchanan is married to the adulterous Tom Buchanan and is the women Gatsby is pining for. While the complex love of these characters unfolds The Great Gatsby tells of society, love, and dying dreams. We see what “foul dust” floats, in not only Gatsby’s dreams but in the other characters’ dreams as well. The prose itself makes this book worth reading, for the beauty of Fitzgerald language is not found in most modern books. A love of complex and adverb studded prose has been abandon for simplistic words. Simplicity is not, of course, synonymous with bad. Simplicity only shows that the voice of the past cannot reach the future, and in The Great Gatsby, the past is ever longed for. "
1594,Opal,"I'm completely biased because I love this book so much. I read it and re read it over and over. The writing, the characters, the themes. I could talk about it all day. I think that The Great Gatsby is quite possibly one of the best books ever written. "
1595,Jdwyah,A deserved reputation. Gatsby is a beautiful creation.
1596,Marivy Bermudez,"""Y así seguimos adelante, botes contra la corriente, empujados sin descanso hacia el pasado"" Increíble libro, me engancho muy rápido... Aún a pesar de que es algo triste..."
1597,Diane Robinson,"The Great Gatsby has been declared one of the best books in its time and in modern times, and now, I know why. It is extremely well written and witty, with character you just can't help to love and/or hate, a story that instantly catches its reader in its web, and descriptive passages that are a symphony for the mind. Highly recommended."
1598,bahar rahnama,the great and unblivable love and love and love...
1599,Madeleine,"Fitzgerald is undoubtedly one of the best writers of The Lost Generation. As a modernist, Fitzgerald's writing is less about plot and more of a study in characters and the American society he experienced. Despite this, he manages to move the plot along in an interesting and engaging way. One of my favorite things about this book is the excitement and wonder Nick finds in New York. He leaves the Midwest because, after returning from the war, he finds is to be some jagged edge of the universe. His hometown lacks the fast-paced life he experienced while in the war. He is disillusioned with his life and he goes to New York in hopes that he will find a new, more lively lifestyle. The New York Fitzgerald presents in Gatsby is exactly like that; parties every night at Gatsby's, the intrigue of the affairs of the wealthy, who seem to exist by their own set of rules, and of course, the constant magic of the city. The Great Gatsby is probably the reason why I love New York so much today and I think that love testifies to how well Fitzgerald was able to present it. I often hear the complaint about this book that none of the characters are likable, and that's fine, it's commonplace, sometime, you're quite simply not meant to. Gatsby is an idealistic dreamer. His belief that the past can be repeat is both endearing and annoying, but yet perfectly represents the American Dream. What American has not gone chasing after some romanticized version of their past at some point of their lives or another? We think to ourselves; if I can only do this, if only this would happen, things would be better. In his heart and soul, that is what Gatsby believes about Daisy; if he can only get her back, he will be happy. Ultimately however, it's not. He manages to woo Daisy once again and knows that she loves him, but once he's achieved this dream, it's not enough. He needs to know that Daisy never loved Tom, that she only ever loved him. But that's not true. There was a moment in her life, however brief, when Daisy did love Tom Buchanan, and although that time has past, and as much as Gatsby tries to ignore it, it's true and there's no denying it. Then there's Tom, who is probably one of the most least likable characters in American Literature. He's a bigot, he's presumptions, he's a prat, and he just doesn't seem to get it. I think Fitzgerald wrote him to be like that for a reason. We're not meant to like Tom, he is simply meant to represent the people of that post-war upper class. The landed money. Tom and his crowd play by a separate set of rules: they believe that they can do whatever they please because they're them, they have money that stretches back generations. We see this especially when Nick comments to Jordan about her driving. ""I don't need to be careful,"" She says, ""Because everyone else will know to get out of my way."" Tom Buchanan is meant to embody this attitude. In his world, it's OK to have a mistress, to take her out to dinner and leave her sitting at the table while you go talk to your friends. Why? Because he's the exception. While it's not entirely acceptable, it's not uncommon, as seen at Gatsby's party when ""the angry diamonds"" hiss in their wayward husbands ears ""You Promised"". And then we get to Daisy, who is weak ad vapid and just goes with the flow. People complain about her and I get why: in our day and age, women speak for themselves, act for themselves. Women live in an incredibly privileged world today. Back in Daisy's time...not so much. Daisy is limited by the constraints of her time-period as well as her class. She knows that Tom is having an affair with Myrtle, but she can't say anything about it. Why? Because as an upper class woman, she needs to resent the image that everything is fine; bright and happy and wonderful. What the rest of the world needs to see is that Daisy is living in a verifiable paradise, and she has to present that image. She can't make a scene, or cause a scandal; she just has to go with it. That's why she tells Nick she hopes her daughter is a beautiful fool. That way, her child will be able to drift through life, beautiful enough to catch a successful man, but ignorant to the imperfections her lifestyle might have. ""But if Daisy loved Gatsby, why did she marry Tom?"" People ask. Well, that's the thing. She tried to leave for New York when Gatsby was sent overseas, but her mom found out and stopped her. Then, a few days before her wedding, when she receives Gatsby's note, she tells Jordan she changes her mind; she doesn't want to marry Tom. She doesn't even want the lavishly expensive pearls that Tom has gotten for her, which are also at the height of fashion. Even as Jordan and Daisy's mother put her into the cold bath, she holds onto Gatsby's letter and only let's go when Jordan shows her that it's falling apart. After every interaction with Gatsby, Daisy is never the same. After initially meeting, and then losing him, she is lost. Jordan testifies that she wouldn't even look at the other officers, despite their many calls, after Gatsby leaves. After being prevented from seeing him off, she doesn't speak with her family for weeks. After receiving his note, then being forced to marry Tom, she seems more resigned to the idea than excited about it. So yes, Daisy is a weak-willed character, but before you judge her so harshly, consider her conditions. We have to remember though that Gatsby is written as a flashback. Nick has returned to the Midwest, in fact, he's in a mental hospital, because after loosing Gatsby, the world is so much bleaker. He's lost faith in the idea that society has good aspects to it, which in fact was a major focus of the modernist writers. The Lost Generation is know for their disillusionment in society. The Great War has just finished. Almost everyone knows someone who either went to the war or was killed in it. And now, with it's conclusion, they are expected to go back to life as per usual, like if none of it ever happened. How do you do that? How are you not affected by an event so immense, so emotionally scarring? The answer is you can't, go back to normal life that is. And so when the modernists wrote, they vented their frustration in the world they returned home to into their works. They reexamine the American dream and question whether it is still possible, if America's integrity and morals have remained intact despite this trouble.So look at Gatsby's New York. He chases his dream and ends up dead because when he got it, it wasn't exactly what he thought it would be and the consequences of that caused things to end badly. The Valley of Ashes is literally towering piles of ash left over from the fireplaces of New York's wealthy that omit the sunshine and joy from the lives of the people who live among these black mountains. Everything is coated in ash; there is simply no escaping it. I see this as yet another way that Fitzgerald is commenting of the elite society in New York. Everything from Gatsby's extravagant parties, thrown for three years in the hopes that Daisy would wander in one night, to Tom's string of Polo ponies that he brings wherever people play polo, emphasize the completely vapid character of the upper class. Tom and Daisy live in France for a year just because they can. That's CRAZY. Who does that? And that is exactly the kind of point Fitzgerald is trying to make. "
1600,Paige Johnson,"	The Great Gatsby follows twenty-something Nick Carraway in his time spent on the East coast outside of New York City. Author F. Scott Fitzgerald comments on the lavish elegance of the 1920’s. The Great Gatsby addresses the abundance of modern indulgences coupled with intense questions of morality and the false security hosted by the past and the previous lifestyles it fostered. Looking into the complex relationships of Nick’s cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom Buchanan alongside the relationships they kindle with their lovers Jay Gatsby and Myrtle Wilson, turmoil quickly arises resulting in the death of Mr. Gatsby and Myrtle all in an attempt to secure the future of these love affairs while attempting to use the past as moral obligation and justification in taking said actions. 	I appreciated the characters embedded throughout this intriguing novel. Each of the members of this piece are truly complex and represent profound concepts of human nature and moral obligation or priority. In some aspects I found Nick Carraway to be an easily relatable character, as he acted as a third party who had access to every elaborate affair and the storyline associated with it. He was able to watch every event unfold, much like the readers, giving him an identity easily perceived as approachable to all audiences. 	The diction in The Great Gatsby was also enjoyable. Fitzgerald expands young modern reader’s vocabulary by inserting extensive pieces of eloquent language authentic to his era. While, I did not understand every word used in this novel, I felt a sense of accomplishment upon finishing the classic, as I had learned a great deal from this author’s writing style while I appreciated the excellently executed plot."
1601,William YU,"The Great Gatsby is truly one of the most interesting books I have ever read in my life. This story is based upon the life of a man named Jay Gatsby and his glamorous life. One of the most interesting aspects of this novel was the fact that it was written in the third person. The narrator Nick Caraway is the neighbor of Gatsby. By having Nick as Gatsby's neighbor, the readers were able to see the extreme wealth carried by this man Gatsby. Even though Gatsby had this enormous amount of wealth, he was not happy. This book was really able to go deep into ones psyche and brings out the question, ""can money really buy you happiness?""I really enjoyed reading this book because it felt a little challenging. But the way the characters were described were truly amazing. Through out the book i felt a constant pity for the wealthy because they were so rich yet so deluded in life, so while reading this book i really was able to learn many things and see things differently. I would recommend this book to people that really want to enjoy a good read, this is not a easy book so dont pick it up if you're not down to really read!"
1602,Apta,"Just re-read this book. It's funny sometimes how timing dictates everything. When I first read this book at 15, it's story of the decadent, corrupt yet stoic Jay Gatsby irreconcilably holding on to an incorruptible dream meant very little. I don't believe I understood this book or the discussions in class about it. Despite that, it made an impression. Through the years, as life took me through experiences I never expected, I remembered Jay Gatsby and his vision of Daisy. The image of Daisy in flowing white on a sofa in West Egg on a hot summer's day never really left my mind. 7 years later, today, as I re-read the book, there wasn't a line in that novel that I couldn't relate to. It was as if the experiences of the last 7 years brought me to the point of understanding the greatness of Jay Gatsby. Whether in his triumph or tragedy, Jay Gatsby became an every-man of sorts.The dark side of those things that are considered to be good. Too much of a good thing. The nightmare that lurks within every dream. I don't really know what I'm writing. All I can say is that F. Scott Fitzgerald, though he does not inspire joy or beauty, sees events for what they are and shows that to the world on the canvas of a novel with absolute mastery. A true artist."
1603,Michelle DeFrancesco," I read this for the second time a couple months ago, about 15 years later from the first time, thinking maybe i was too young the first time to appreciate the ""great american novel.""I'm not sure what I'm missing here- man and girl fall in love, man goes off to war, girl determined to marry wealthy, marries someone else. man comes back from war, becomes self made millionaire through bootlegging and other illicit activities, becomes man of mystery for the NY/long island crowd. Stalks girl. Buys house across the way from her. befriends her cousin- convinces him to get them together, cousin parties with them all at various times, including girls husband and husbands mistress. cousin starts dating girls friend, the tennis pro. man makes play for girl, girl kills husbands mistress with mans car while man and girl are galavanting, mistresses husband kills man them self- girl and husband conspire to wash their hands of the whole thing... rich peoples problems *sniff*I like his writing style- it's similar to mine- he uses lots of hyphens- maybe if I had thrown some 1920's Jazz in while reading it, it would have helped"
1604,Analia Wu,"The Great Gatsby talks about the protagonist Gatsby from another narrator's perspective. He is an educated rich man who likes to throw a party every week. Nick, as his neighbor and the narrator of this novel, is eager to meet this mysterious man. There are many rumors about his wealth and his flirting with girls. However, the reality is that he is deeply in love with a woman named Daisy, who is already married.He asks Nick to make a reunion so that Daisy and him can meet. They meet one afternoon but their conversation is full of emptiness. Later, Gatsby died because he takes the blame for Daisy who actually killed Tom's wife, Myrtle. His dream to live happily with Daisy never comes true. After his death, Nick views the people who once surround Gatsby with confusion and frustration. It reveals how materialistic people are and how easily a dream can be broken. It has a lot of important cultrue revelation and a lot of significant themes. AH so good. "
1605,Benjamín Hernández-Rodríguez,"""Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,"" he told me, ""just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.""""""They're a rotten crowd,"" I shouted across the lawn. ""You're worth the whole damn bunch put together."" I've always been glad I said that.""""He smiled understandingly... It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it... It faced—or seemed to face—the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.""“Then he kissed her. At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.” “Can’t repeat the past?…Why of course you can!” “Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of non-olfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.” ""And I hope she'll be a fool — that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.""""It makes me sad because I've never seen such — such beautiful shirts before.""“Her voice is full of money,”""―Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.""""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy — they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money of their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.""""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter — tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther . . . . And one fine morning — So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
1606,Shereen Hanna,"Truly brilliant, this book shows portrays to the readers all aspects of class, love and unhappiness. This book was written in the time where alcohol had been prohibited in America (however people still drank it) and there were great quantities of it being trafficked into the state. This demonstrates that, even though it was illegal, there was some sort of fascination to having the “forbidden fruit”.The Great Gatsby is also a remarkable novel that emphasizes class issues extremely well, viewing the bizarre way they grow and break, and the way views are formed of the rich and poor.I give this book a 5/5 for its pure and sheer brilliance in depicting the cogs and flaws of an indeterminate society."
1607,Bradley,"Ripe with symbolism, which means most people are too stupid to realize the subtleties. If you like this one, and can appreciate its depths, then try ""The Crack-Up"", a story about a man on the verge of a meltdown. "
1608,Jen Estrella,"Love Gatsby. Absolutely love. Read this book for the first time sometime around my freshmen year of high school. Actually, maybe it was a little earlier... it was assigned to us for History class my freshmen year and I had already read it by then!The book is short, but deliberate. I can always read and re-read thru this book in less than a day. But that doesn't mean it's not full to the brim with meaning, (and my love!) It's a beautifully written book, Fitzgerald writes about life, disappointment, expectations and class/class separations in such a craftily eloquent way. He flows. The book flows, it flows right thru you actually. By the time you're thru you feel totally invested as if you'd been reading the book for weeks, as if Fitzgerald spent 700 pages developing characters, creating layers upon layers for you to discover and unravel. It doesn't have to be thick to be mighty, and ohh is this a mighty book.Everyone should read this book. It's beautiful, which is reason enough."
1609,Ezra Marcel,"To those who know me off of the internet, my love for this book is abundantly clear. I have a lot of adoration for the love-struck Jay Gatsby, and I even have a bit of a literary crush on the object of his desire, for though I know of many a person who couldn't stand a thing about the fluttery little Daisy, I couldn't help but adore her.The book is, simply, a classic. A perfect model of the broken American dream. Poor Mr. Gatsby created an entire new persona for himself so he could ""get the girl,"" when in the end it ended up getting him nothing but a... well, that's a spoiler.Fitzgerald's rich imagery is present all throughout the book, though my favorite instances are all of Mr. Gatsby's parties. They make me want to get up and shake it. (Which I probably would have done if we weren't reading it in my first period Honors American Literature class.) The villain(s) in this book are wonderful, our narrator thoughtful and sweet (and at a certain point so silly it made me put my book down to laugh), and the overarching message something so bitterly sad and hopeless you'll be forced to focus on the first forty pages to put a smile back on your face.The Great Gatsby is a masterpiece, plain and simple. Even if it does rip your heart out and stomp on it in a pair of Daisy's stupidly expensive boots."
1610,Lanxal,"Ok, wow. In my first read, The Great Gatsby was a good book, a great book, but only something that I felt in ending it, and a feeling that disappeared quickly after that last page. But in rereading it, I somehow found that secret doorway hidden amidst the words to the Great American Novel that it is. I'm reminded yet again about the power of words, of the abrasive but true mantra of reading between the lines, and how the world is wonderful not because of the sheer size of all that I have yet to see, but that even the things I've seen can hold new wonder.The Great Gatsby was simply fantastic on the second way through. John Green says, and now I have to admit, that critical reading is not simply a chore for school, but a real way of getting a better sense of a novel and its message. In The Great Gatsby my views of the characters have changed since my first read, perhaps most stunning of all revelations, Gatsby; when I once saw him simply as great and gorgeous, now I wonder if it might only have been his dreams. My favourite line from the book is not the foul dust in the wake of our dreams, or the last line (to which I dislike spoiling, so I won't), but something Owl Eyes says at the end of the novel — ""The poor son-of-a-bitch."" With a focus on that last phraseword. =DIn conclusion, 1) The Great Gatsby is wonderful, and 2) Holy crap there were a lot of colour words (especially blue, gold and white) in this thing."
1611,Libby Bushill,"First of all, this edition is exuberant and luxurious and beautiful, just like the wonderful story within. On to the book...The mere fact that this book exists is one of my favourite things about the world. The gorgeous description and stunning language make this novel come to life in your hands. You can almost hear the music and the laughter of Gatsby's careless partygoers. The beginning of this story makes me entirely happy, and the second half desperately sad, however the whole thing as a whole calms me. I speak more fluently and with more grace whilst reading The Great Gatsby, and honestly I think anything that can evoke such a reaction is definitely worth reading."
1612,Nomad,"I am so glad I have finally read this book, it is one of those books that haunt you and stay with you always. Having just finished it, I feel a sense of loss and melancholy. I am certain that my view of the book will change with every subsequent read."
1613,Teresa Galindo-anguiano,"The Great Gatsby written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, was indeed a great book. It takes place in the 1920's, it is about a man named Gatsby who lives in west egg and Daisy and Tom who live in east egg. West egg is known for those who have new money and east egg is known for those who have old money. Gatsby is known for his big parties, which he throughs to see if Daisy will night just appear to his party. Daisy and Gatsby had an earlier relationship before he went to war and Daisy did not want to wait for him to come back, so she married Tom who was rich and won her over with his charm.Back then it was normal to have a mistress, but it was not to get divorced. Tom had a mistress and Daisy knew about it. He went to go visit her with Gatsby's neighbor and Daisy's cousin Nick. He took her to town where he had an apartment for them two. Tom always told Myrtle's husband-his mistress's husband-that he would sell him a car but Wilson-Myrtle's husband-was so clueless he didnt know he was never going to get a car.Gatsby and Daisy had an affair together. They were in love and Gatsby was so blind he would do anything for her even if it killed him. One day Gatsby,Tom, Myrtle, Nick,Daisy and Jordan were all going into town Tom, Nick and Jordan went in Gatsby's car and Gatsby and Daisy went in Tom's car. When Gatsby's car was running out of gas he took it to Wilson's garage to get gas. He told him he just bought it last week and if he wanted it. After they went into town and were at Tom's house Gatsby told him that Daisy did not love him. They got into a big argument and Daisy and Gatsby left to New York on their way back they saw Myrtle, but they did not know her, and ran over and killed her. Gatsby took the blame even though Daisy was the one driving. Wilson went to Tom's house about to kill him for killing his wife, but Tom told him the car was Gatsby's and Wilson went over to Gatsby's and shot him."
1614,sevda,"How come none of my friends ever told me how amazing Fitzgerald is? That is, except Murakami. He gave me the hint. And Paul Auster, of course... I really loved this novel. And this author."
1615,Cynnea Schreibman,"Fitzgerald, F., & Bruccoli, M. (1996). The great Gatsby. New York, NY: Scribner.The Great Gatsby is an awesome 1920s Classic. I love older books and also ones that show different eras. There are many symbols in this book and it makes you think. I loved how in this book there are many symbols you cant quite figure out what they are until you read the whole book and then analyze the characters and clues. This book takes place in the summer of 1922 and Jay Gatsby the witty, wealthy Heartthrob falls back in love with Daisy an upscale new money debutante. Fitzgerald wrote this book inspired by actual parties in long island that he attended and he wrote the book in 1923. I love envisioning the way the people look from the 1920’s look in the book and how beautiful the descriptions are of everything from the houses to alcohol. I think this book is appropriate for teenagers to adults because it is definitely a book you have to fully understand to enjoy."
1616,Colin Sweeney,"The main character is a man named Nick Carraway who moves to the West Egg District of Long Island in New York, and meets his next door neighbor who is a strange man named Jay Gatsby. Nick is very different from everyone on the island because he is multi-dimensional and has contacts in the rich East Egg. However, everyone that he meets in the city is shallow, materialistic, and uninteresting as a person. One night, he gets invited to one of Gatsby's parties, and meets Gatsby who reveals that he was in love with a woman, and all of the money that he amassed, and connections that he made were to impress her. Nick's relatives Tom and Daisy are also main characters, and the woman that Gatsby loves just happens to be Daisy. They are reintroduced and eventually get involved in an affair, and one night, Gatsby has dinner with them, and Tom realizes that Gatsby is in love with her, which is hypocritical because Tom, himself, is involved in an affair. It is then revealed that Gatsby has a fortune because he committed crimes, and is involved in illegal activities, and Daisy, even though she loves Gatsby, goes to Tom because he is safer. Tom then lets Gatsby take Daisy home, and Daisy ends up driving the car, and happens to hit and kill Tom's lover, Myrtle. Then, Myrtle's husband, who is driven mad by his wife's infidelity, goes to Gatsby's house and shoots him because he thinks that Gatsby is her lover. He then shoots himself, and later, Nick holds a funeral for Gatsby. He then moves back to the midwest because he is disgusted with the people in New York.I personally think that this simply goes to show how people's nature is to be shallow and self-involved. But, this is just one isolated example, and shouldn't be represented to be all people. These people were simply corrupted by money and the New York lifestyle. If anything, it goes to show that the main corruptor of people is money, itself. Also, it goes to show how there are good people in the world like Gatsby, but those people can easily be corrupted. Also, the second chief corruptor of people is love because not to be cliche, but love can cause people to do crazy things. But, there are also good people that can resist the temptations of things like money and love, and come to rise above their situations, like Nick, who decides to move back to the midwest. But, overall, I liked this book and would reccomend it to anyone. So, I basically think that the purpose of this novel is to enlighten the readers about human nature, and that good people can easily be corrupted, and the two largest sources of this corruption are love and money. This also ties back to the central theme of the book, which is how outside influences, especially money, caused the American lifestyle, itself to collapse during the 1920's. Everyone became so concerned with fiscal issues that they forgot how to truly enjoy life, and when they lost their money due to the Great Depression, they became so lost that life, itself, became not worth living"
1617,Michael Vagnetti,"What makes a great party is when death is not too far away. Or something like that. It's not a platitude, but more like an expression of a kind of hope, or moral willpower, that Gatsby presages and then juggles. We are waiting for Nick Carraway, oddly distant narrator, ""inclined to reserve all judgments,"" to weigh in on the party: if love and the past survive under threat. We wait, until people start feeling - hot, sloppy, and fast - what Carraway calls their ""contributary emotion."" We eventually learn that Carraway disapproves of Gatsby. But the effects of feelings, their blends and contradictions, take care of the need for any moralizing. We compete not on speed or money, but on how well we manage their quandaries.The first half of this book is joy-mined with thrill potential: wealth/pedigree/leisure, sex, half-revealed secrets that might be tricks. Snappy and adept, we interlopers are lathered up by the writing to see how Gatsby signs his name, and with what color ink. It's terrifying, then, not only what people are willing to feel, but what they're willing to forget. The host is asking us to go hydroplaning in the morning, but there's suffocating ""dust"" in all hues of the venality spectrum here: adultery, racism, petty lies, battery, affectation, war, boredom, murder."
1618,Andy,"Plot:We all dream of the green light, we all have our enchanted objects. And „The Great Gatsby“ is a book about these dreams and hopes we all share.It’s about the mysterious Jay Gatsby, a wealthy man who nobody seems to really know, let alone how he ended up in West Egg’s biggest mansion with the finest parties that everybody wants to be part of. But he doesn’t seem to enjoy the parties or his wealth or his pool at all. He doesn’t drink, he doesn’t dance, he’s not having fun.Nick Carraway, his new neighbor and the narrator of this book, is one of the few people who gets to find out.(view spoiler)[Gatsby didn’t become this man because he wanted to, but because he wanted to impress someone. Daisy Buchanan to be exact, the girl he loved since he met her five years ago and who is now married to Tom Buchanan – who is probably the biggest jerk I’ve ever come across in any book. And in the end all he wants is to get her back. Or that’s what he thinks, because what he really wants is to get the feeling he had back, when he was with her. (hide spoiler)]The ending is one of the saddest in modern literature.Critique:F. Scott Fitzgerald, himself having faced some challenges in his romantic relationships, wrote something that affects us all. We all want to forget about the bad things that happened to us and are happening every day in front of our eyes. And the incredible need for closure and innocence can drive us mad. That’s what happened to Gatsby, eventually. He had put all of his hope, his work - basically his whole life into achieving that one dream. But what happens when that dream just doesn’t work out? What are we left with then? With the foul dust that floated in the wake of those dreams.An unbelievably good book about the corruption of our dreams and wishes and the reason we can’t be happy. It’s about our inability to let go of hopes and live completely in reality, about our desire to go back in time to a place where we were safe and happy. Reality is a harsh unthankful thing and if we don’t stop it from invading our lives we will go insane or indifferent or cold or whatever other theory might haunt us. But on the other hand, would we still be human if we did? Isn’t it this fault, this inability, our imaginations and our hopes that make us what we are, human beings?Isn’t it impossible to achieve both? To go back in time to reach this green light AND grasp at the future?This book is about the question what or who we really are. It’s about the juggling act between past and future, between dreams and reality, between common sense and insanity. And the humaneness inbetween. So if we could only run faster, stretch out our arms father... and one fine morning...Bottom line:Funny, sad, disturbing, hopeless, full of ambition and ceaselessly fascinating. Whether you like it or not, this book is an essential piece of literature that deserves to be read. It’s the advice that you’ll be turning over in your mind again and again, to quote Nick."
1619,Marlene Barrera,"F.Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby entertained me with its melodramatic and unusual climax. It is a perfect epitome of a portrait of American Society. Nick Carraway's, narrator of the story, goes through rocky times. Carraway moved to Minnesota to learn about bond business and pursue his career. Jay gatsby soon is presented to Nick, where they later on are around each other most of the time. Gatsby has an affair with Nick’s cousin, Daisy, who was married with an old friend of Nick. Throughout the novel, Fitzgerald reveals the loss of hope and the loss of the american dream.Fitzgerald exposes justice, power, and the American dream as consideration for the readers to seek. Carraway experiences not the best life ever due to all the conflicts Daisy’s affair led to. He was so glued to gatsby while he was too blind to notice he was bad influence.I was definitely satisfied reading this book. I was clearly hooked ever since the beginning, especially since I love reading about the history and the past days. His style was very clear and made total sense. He describes everything perfectly and knows how to interest a reader. The main characters throughout the novel are Nick, Daisy, Gatsby, and tom who was Daisy’s partner. Even Though it’s unlikely to say this but I disliked Nick the most. Even though he was the most placid out of all the characters, it was really concerning how he would really make never do favors for himself. Until he experienced all these conflicts and realized all the negative energy all these people brought to him, he had changed. He should of went his own way and followed his positive life since the beginning, all the characters brought him down. This book takes place back in the early 1920s in New York city. During the times New york was developing. Fitzgerald, helps you image the setting very clearly from the very beginning such as when he wrote, ""Gatsby turned out alright at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men."" Fitzgerald delivers very ironic surprises. This book is slightly comparable with The Crucible, they both have a setting of history. Throughout these two books, people have affairs such as Abigail and John and Daisy and Gatsby. These affairs led to many conflicts which sustained throughout the whole book which made these similar. Consequently, Nick decides to ends relationships and moves out to the Midwest. Nick is unpleased and unhappy by his actions and the people who surrounded him. He heads for a new beginning and a positive life. Particularly, I would recommend this book to anyone. This book is a perfect illustration of history in America in the 1920s. Not only history, but it perfectly illustrates the American Dream of Society."
1620,Mohammed El-esnawy,"The Great Gatsby captures the american dream in about 180 pages. Everything in this novel is real, the carelessness of the rich with which it ruins poor, the excessive drunkness, and the back-stabbing. Its all real except for the romance, which is exaggerated, as it always is in the novels. No guy would ever ruin himself over a girl he dated for a month about 5 years ago. But offcourse its not just about the girl, Daisy Buchanan, its about the fact that Gatsby is "" Mr. Nobody from Nowhere"" and he didn't come by his money homestly so ultimately he is led to believe that if he goes back to Louisville and marries Daisy, as if it was 5 years ago, he would become somebody from somewhere. "
1621,Maria Ch,"I love this book. This is the second time I read it and it definitely won't be the last. This book is named after a character everyone around him knows of (whose stories about him are part of the narration) but no one knows essentially. A man who dreams of a future in which he will be able to recapture the past, the only difference is power provided by money, because all the relationships in this novel come down to that. There is a mystery veil surrounding the character of Gatsby, an elusiveness that follows his name and figure. Before we even meet him through the eyes of the narrator, we know a lot about him. His characters consists of a projection of speculation, gossip, hypothesis and inaccuracies. A love story, a power struggle, a story of class divisions and old vs new money, a story of corruption and lost chances. It deals with endless themes and symbolisms, but ultimately it is one of these books everyone should read and Gatbsy is a Jekyll and Hyde, Frankenstein kind of figure that everyone should know of in terms of iconic literary figures. "
1622,Marissa Haddlin," The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is another book that has strongly influenced my life and way of thinking. I read this book my freshman year of high school in an english II class, and the vivid, colorful symbolism, plot, and themes caught and held my attention. This book is about Jay Gatsby, a wealthy man who appears out of seemingly nowhere, and hosts huge parties to impress his lover from what may have seemed like a past life, the young and beautiful Daisy Buchanan. The story is told by Nick Carraway, Gatsby's neighbor. The book focuses on topics such as the past, wealth, and ultimately love and what one will give and give up for love. As far as humanity goes, The Great Gatsby demonstrates that humans are greedy beings. This theme shows through the plot when Gatsby has an affair with Daisy, despite the fact that Daisy is a married woman. Gatsby also creates and exerts power over people by throwing these extravagant galas. He is the talk of the town and his powerful, mysterious character and past have the power to entice Daisy to be his lover once again, much like years ago."
1623,Duane Bindschadler,"Maybe someday I'll take the time to think through and provide a review that explores (at least to some small degree of adequacy) the themes that twine their way through this novel. Presented as the reflections of one Nick Carraway on his experiences with the novel's eponymous protagonist, it manages to capture almost whole that brief era of the American experience called the Roaring Twenties. Less concerned with the surface glamour and glitter of that time, it instead manages to capture the stunning self-involvement and lack of a moral center that formed the sand-built foundation ready to be swept away in the hurricane of the Great Depression. The book itself is dense and at times difficult to read it -- but the patient reader is rewarded in the latter half of the book by the vivid clarity of some of Fitzgerald's imagery as well as his ability to make us feel we are experiencing events as the narrator himself. The Greatest Books lists ""The Great Gatsby as #8 in its list of greatest works of fiction. The list is a weighted composite ranking based on 107 different published ""greatest books"" lists. "
1624,Robert Morgan,"The Great Gatsby is probably my favorite book of all time, and all because of Gatsby. Gatsby's character had me so involved in the story that I could hardly put the book down. I liked how the story was told, how Nick told the story of his good friend Gatsby from his point view. I believe that society today would love this book, because it tells stories of grand parties and massive amounts of alcohol. I found this theme of drinking and partying to be very appropriate for the time period it was set in. It showed that, the people of the 20's were all about the party cause for all intensive purposes it was illegal. I would 100% recommend this to a friend because it is story that will go down in history. My favorite theme of Gatsby is the ""go for what you want in life"" theme. I liked this theme because it is something that everyone in every time period can relate to. It shows us that what we want wont change unless we do something about it. "
1625,Brett,"	The novel The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald takes us through two different stories at once all under the perspective of our neighboring fellow Nick Carraway, the story of a man who moves next door to a man to be known as the iconic “American Dream”, a self made millionaire, and it also tells the romantic love story of a woman (Daisy) and a rich man (Gatsby) who were separated but their romantic love is rekindled once that Daisy realizes that he had become a very rich man, but their love is blocked by the fact that in the five years of their separation Daisy had married a hulking brute of a man, who is also a very rich man, Tom Buchanan. It takes you through all of the twists and turns of how the two are going to keep their love together after all that happens.	Fitzgerald started this novel with a slow and bland beginning. When I had first started reading it, I had the feeling that it was going to turn out to be a tasteless story. But at about the third chapter, the tales of Gatsby, Nick, and Daisy had always kept me very entertained to say the least. He always had presented a new event that is taking place and something fresh and exciting was bound to happen through each new chapter. The book has you always trying to figure out what will happen next and what problems are the characters going to encounter. I had really enjoyed the book after making it through the beginning because it really gave you an insight of what the upper class living was like back in that time period, and while currently learning U.S, history it was intriguing to make the connections to the book and history.	I recommend any high school student to read the book because as you are learning much about what kind of events they are talking about in the book such as The Great War, The Great Panic and others it is fun to see the connections being made and I found it to be very interesting. I’m giving this book a five star rating because I believe that most people should have a chance to read this book as it is one of the books that everyone should read."
1626, Ruth Noemi Rojas,"First of all, I would like to thank the Lord for allowing me the opportunity to read this book. I had to read this book for my *AP English class, and it was surprisingly really good. I loved Nick. I liked Jordan and Daisy as well. I honestly thought that it was going to end differently. For a classic, this book was fantastic! I don't really have that much to say other than that it was really good and I enjoyed it a lot more than The Scarlet Letter. "
1627,Kjell Meyer,"This was the second time reading this book, and I loved it even more than the first time I read it! This is definitely one of my favourite books!"
1628,Jenny at Jennyinneverland,"I know my little review of this book is irrelevant in amongst a sea of reviews and to be honest I was considering not even writing one but reading this book was an achievement for me so I decided to write one anyway! As I’m used to modern and current writing, this narrative did throw me a bit at first. I found it a little hard to gather enough steam to not only get into the book but understand it and live it out in my own mind but having said that, once I got in to it, I whizzed through it without an awful lot of trouble at all. Once I passed the initial, ‘Oh my God I’m reading one of the most famous classics known to man’, I very much enjoyed the exceptional writing style and the storyline.Having seen the film I already knew what this book was about and although you’re supposed to read the book before the film and all that, I’m actually really glad I did this the other way around. Being set in an era and place I’m completely unfamiliar with, If I hadn’t seen the film and experienced the costumes, music and settings, I’m not scared to admit that I would have been extremely lost. Jay Gatsby’s character really is one in a million. He’s dominating, enchanting and completely addictive to read about. I love the scene where Nick meets him for the first time and spends an entire paragraph describing his smile. He says, “he smiled understandingly -much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced – or seemed to face – the world external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour.” The book delves deep into Gatsby’s mysterious persona and despite his flawless outward façade, he really isn’t as ‘great’ as he seems. Unlike the film where all my attention was on Gatsby (wonder why?) I was far more drawn to Nick in the book and I completely adored his innocent and naïve character and despite the story being told by him, this really does come across beautifully from the way he narrates the book.It’s such a beautifully written book that manages to capture the essence of the story entirely. I particularly liked how Gatsby’s house and his infamous parties were described. It instantly transports you to this unfamiliar world and makes you want to be a part of the glamour and drama which is their lives. For a book like The Great Gatsby, it doesn’t have to be long, unnecessary and complicated for you to get out of it what the author intended, which is why my review is fairly short too. There’s no need for me to go on and on about how wonderful it is because it’s not going to do it justice. Those mere 140 pages had so much life and wisdom in them it’s easy to understand why this is one of the most well-known classics ever written.Find all my reviews here: www.jennyinneverland.wordpress.com"
1629,Hannah Hill,"Romance, Betrayal, and Mystery; The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald has it all between two bindings. After spending a few weeks indulged in the words written by Fitzgerald you will have a hard time letting go of the novel. The Great Gatsby intrigues readers not only through the fascinating description but the use of heartbreak. After letting your eyes see the first page you are taken by the beauty of writing and see yourself standing between east and west egg.The Great Gatsby in told by a character named Nick Carroway, World War 2 veteran and a new bond salesman. The story is told right before the great depression when Nick moves next door to the infamous Jay Gatsby. After moving in to his small bungalow on long island, Nick is invited to dinner with his second removed cousin, Daisy. After the name Gatsby is brought up at the dinner table foreshadowing is introduced to a relationship previous with Jay and Daisy. Early in the novel Jay and Nick befriend each other after meeting at a luxury Gatsby party. The duo stays friends throughout each obstacle they take. Nick and Jay’s obstacles include cheating, scandal, young lively characters, and of course the romance of Jay and Daisy. Fitzgerald truly captures the sense of living and taking each moment in. He talks about the past and how sometimes you just can’t have what you’ve always dreamt of and live for as Jay lives for Daisy. I found myself asking page after page, Does Daisy feel the love the Jay is feeling for her? Is it mutual? The dictation used in the writing is advanced and sometimes hard to interrupt and was my only down fault I found when turning each page. For readers more advanced then I, this book will be number 1 on your favorite novel list."
1630,Ellie Kreidie,"“The loneliest moment in someone’s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.” The Great Gatsby is a book filled with the lives of the wealthy that ruled the heart of the world (New York) during the early 1900’s. This book is a classic, American book filled with a rich plot and creative character development. The Great Gatsby is a book that features the life of Jay Gatsby, a extremely wealthy young man living on the borders of New York City. Gatsby has an undying love with a unhappily married Daisy, with the help of her cousin Nick, Gatsby and Daisy begin having an affair. From there, the reader experiences a love story celebrating a couple and their life, as well as the American Dream. The Great Gatsby, continues to inspire conversations among people across our world about the value of the so-called American Dream. This book takes a different point of view into the importance and reality of the American Dream from the viewpoint of wealthy people. With extravagant parties and no sense of reality, the characters is this book give the reader a powerful insight into the lives that rule us. All the people in the book are horrible human beings. However, their opinions and lives give us an understanding of why and how our country has gotten to be the way it is. The Great Gatsby has captured so many minds fixed on understanding the power that the wealthy within our borders holds and figuring out how their lives influence that. The Great Gatsby is a necessary read for everyone. "
1631,Lauren Turffs," The Great Gatsby begins as a story from the perspective of young and hopeful Nick Carraway who has moved to a house in West Egg-the not as fashionable side of East Egg neighborhood. As is widely known, Carraway's next door neighbor is a man called Jay Gatsby who is a mysterious, party throwing man that no one has actually seen-or if they have, they don't know. One night at dinner with his cousin, Daisy, and her husband in East Egg, Carraway meets her friend Jordan Baker. Later that evening Carraway find out through Baker that Daisy's husband Tom is cheating on her with a lady named Myrtle from a not so reputable part of the town. That evening sets the tone for the book and also sets up a lot of future happenstances. Later in the novel, Carraway finds he has an invitation to a party at his elusive neighbor's wild mansion extravaganzas; there Carraway and Baker meet Gatsby for the first time. The information Carraway find out about his neighbor he learns from what Baker tells him and I imagine he was surprised to find out that all of the crazy, razzle dazzle parties are solely to garner the attention of his beautiful cousin Daisy because Gatsby is hopelessly in love with her. As seen in the film, Gatsby says he spends nights staring at the green light on the end of Daisy's dock and it is heart breaking to read about his love for her because he knows she is married.  Overall, I really loved the novel because I enjoy it's themes that reflect back on how one can have such an empty ""full"" life but at the end when it really matters, there was no one there for Gatsby except Jordan. I think it has timeless themes of struggle ridden love and the trials and tribulations one must go through to follow their heart and to protect those they care about most. "
1632,O,"“So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”I have never read The Great Gatsby before now and somehow managed to not watch either movie about this book. Reading this book and having it end the way that it does, I just want to watch the Leonardo DiCaprio version since the gifs alone has me feel like this version captures the book quite well. This book takes place during the Jazz Age, just before World War II erupts. Narrated by Nick Carraway, we have him tell the tale of Jay Gatsby and his unending love for Daisy. Nick's character is there as a reader stand-in. We get to read about his thoughts about some of the people in the book here and there, but often he is merely re-telling a story to us that seems as if he has told it to himself repeatedly over and over again.What I thought was well done is that we have Nick introduce us to Tom and Daisy Buchanan as well as to their friend Jordan Baker before we meet the mysterious Jay Gatsby. The three of them (Tom, Daisy, and Jordan) seem to be the very best epitome of the Jazz Age. Three people who don't seem to have a care in the world. Who look to their own pleasures first, and people second.It's not surprising to find that Tom is backwards in his thinking (he goes in on the darker races rising up to crush the whites) and we quickly find out that he is not the husband that Daisy wishes him to be.Daisy from our first glimpses of him seems shrewd and lost. She apparently knows what Tom is about when he is not with her. And it kills Daisy time and time again that no matter what she does, her husband is out there on one of his little ""sprees.""Daisy seems to be everything that is golden and right though readers and Nick quickly get to see how shallow inside and out she is.When we finally have Nick meet Gatsby you can read his disapproval and fascination of this man throughout the entire book. Eventually you realize that Nick in his own way though pitied Gatsby and wanted to protect him, because Nick saw way before Gatsby that his dream of Daisy and the life they should have had together, was not going to ever come.When Jay comes upon Daisy the first time, you just feel for him. He is awkward and you know that he wants everything to happen as he has pictured it, probably a million times at that point. What to do when you find out that everything that Gatsby has become, bought, made, was all for Daisy. The one woman that he feels understands him and has loved him, even though she has been married five years at this point to Tom. I could feel Nick's impatience and also love for Gatsby at times. Gatsby is quite childlike, when talking of Daisy, his belief that she could not have loved Tom ever, that she was forced because of Gatsby's circumstances to marry Tom. But Gatsby's blindness to Daisy's failings is ultimately his undoing. And in the end Nick is right, you can't repeat the past. I thought that the writing was fantastic. From beginning to end. This book flows together so nicely you often wonder how you were able to get from one chapter to another since it feels so seamless.The setting of New York, with Gatsby's home, Daisy's, home, and all of the other places in the book mentioned feels so real. The dock where the green light from Daisy's home is and where Gatsby looked to frequently for her, felt like a place I could trace with my own steps if one day I wanted to.The parties, the drinking, the laughing, the music, the people. The way that Fitzgerald writes it, you might as well have been standing alongside Nick while he was a guest too.What makes a great book to me is that you become so invested in the characters you want a different ending than the one you are provided. And so at the end, I wish for a different ending for Jay Gatsby than the one he got. As one characters says to Nick in the end, ""the poor son of a bitch."""
1633,David," I have been struggling with why I fell the upcoming Baz Luhrmann 3D film of ""The Great Gatsby"" is inherently a travesty, and, having just seen GATZ (in which they read the entire novel on stage) I think I have it worked out. The book is itself about our inability to realize our own dreams and aspirations fully and satisfactorily. Gatsby's true tragedy is that his dreams were always greater then the realities they created. In GATZ they deal with this central theme by not trying to create a representation of the world of the book on-stage. Instead, they allow the world of the book to always live inside our own minds. Even as an actor speaks the words said by Gatsby or Daisy, we are aware that these actors look nothing like the characters and this distance allows the true and pure Gatsby and Daisy to live in our minds. To so miss the point of the book as to want to not only make a film of it, but to make that film in the most-ridiculous medium humanity has come across in our the vain attempt to recreate life, 3D, shows that Baz Luhrmann has no understanding of the book and, like Gatsby himself, is more in love with his own dream and doesn't care what gets hurt or destroyed in the futile attempt to grasp it."
1634,Carolina Zapotitla," F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby captures the readers attention by not only writing about love but as well as the American Dream. This book has many themes and lessons we can all learn about life. For example, the books character Nick Carraway quotes his father by saying, “Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.” With this quote readers can already tell this book will be a good read. Throughout the book there are many characters presented as well as themes. The theme that interested me most was the American dream. This book takes place in the 1920s. It was a time when people were happy and everything was good. Fitzgerald shows a different side of this era by focusing on the hypocrisy and shallow recklessness. This book has many great quotations and one of them includes a quote by character Daisy saying ""And I hope she'll be a fool — that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool."" She says this talking about her hopes for her young daughter. Since this book takes place in the 1920s she says this because in this time it was better for a woman to be beautiful and simple, without causing problems or questioning anything. The American Dream according to Fitzgerald was ""originally about discovery, individualism, and the pursuit of happiness."" however, easy money and social values have corrupted this dream. In this book Gatsby and Daisy have a strong connection but because Daisy is already married and society/money won't allow them to be together their relationship is complicated.  Overall this book was well written and very intriguing. With all the lessons that this book talks about and the adventures the characters go through it makes readers want to keep reading. I would recommend this book to all people of all ages. "
1635,Davis,"I truly don't understand how anyone could dislike this book. Rich symbolism and beautiful, awe-inspiring prose. I read the book once a year, just so I always have it fresh in my mind how much I love this book."
1636,Haruhi,"Compararé el leer este libro con estar en el mar, todo esta en calma y te meces suavemente entre las olas, pero de repente... Llega una enorme ola y te derriba hacia afuera del mar con las sensaciones a flor de piel y lo único que haces es regresar al mar para sentirlo otra vez, algo así fue conmigo al leer este libro, al principio todo transcurrió tranquilo, me estaba gustando de verdad y de repente, una ola de sentimientos se me vino encima y bueno, heme aquí terminando este libro con muy buen sabor de boca, personajes bien perfilados y la forma de escribir, exquisita.Sin duda uno de los favoritos del 2013."
1637,Aaron Sta.Clara,"I've watched the movie adaptation of this outstanding prose.The Great Gatsby shows us the grandeur of America during the Jazz Age.I,being an avid reader of many American novels,adore the said country.Don't be mistaken!I adore Philippines the same as I adore America.In my own opinion,both countries are equally rich in terms of culture and the arts.Period.  This novel features the hopeful Gatsby through the powerful narration of Nick Carraway.The first chapter is certainly a 'boom'Here's an excerpt:In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.""Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,"" he told me, ""just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."" The movie didn't show the 'spark' that had gone between Jordan Baker and Nick Carraway.The director,as far as I know,wanted the film to exalt the profound friendship between Gatsby and Nick. The end of this novel is unutterably forlorn.I've been awstruck by the supreme writing of this book.I can feel the emotions,the metaphor,the complex but understandable way of the author in conveying the story. I love this book,it changed my perspective in life.And I will never forget the last lines of the greatest book of American literature: Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther… . And one fine morning——So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."
1638,Frederic  Germay,"Fitzgerald's prose is something special. The story, on the other hand, isn't especially so. I remember reading it as part of the assigned literature in high school, I wasn't exactly wowed. Upon a more recent read though, it fares much better.I've seen a few exciting trailers for the cinematic adaptation by Baz Luhrmann (what a name!), and it seems rather pretty and all that, but I have a few reservations about it. The beauty of Gatsby is not the story, but how it was written. I'm not sure that can properly be translated into film. Had a similar reaction to On the Road's adaptation.The last few pages are among the finest pieces of literature out there. The last line particularly struck a chord with me, so much so I had it tattooed over my heart.""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past..."""
1639,Sam Quixote,"East Coast America, 1922, and young Nick Carraway decides to rent a house in the fictional town for the rich, West Egg, while he tries to make it in the city trading bonds. Except his life is about to change as he meets his flamboyant and rich neighbour, Jay Gatsby, whose charisma and lifestyle will spirit Nick away to catch glimpses of how the rich live in 1920s America, the good and the bad. But Gatsby isn't all he seems and when Nick introduces him to his married cousin Daisy and her husband Tom Buchanan, their fatal company will reveal to Nick the sordid and black-hearted side to the American Dream.What to say about this book that's not been said before? Should there be a superlative limit for this novel? And where should someone start? Well, I read this book several years ago and decided to re-read it recently to see if the novel was as good as I remembered, as clever and well written, as fun and as sad, and with a beating heart still behind it; and I was glad to find that it still did.Nick Carraway is a brilliant narrator, flawed and biased, yet all-seeing out of all the characters; we see Gatsby as a charming personality at first and then slowly and subtly see the flaws in his character, see through the lies that go into the creation of his persona and the darkness beneath. We see Daisy and Tom as a sad married couple - Daisy full of regret yet unable to leave because of her love of Tom's money and Tom with his numerous infidelities and foul temper showing how the rich can live a life free of consequence.The book contains many images of startling beauty such as Gatsby wearing his pink tuxedo at his glittering parties, the green light from Daisy's window in the night, the decayed ruins of Gatsby's mansion, the decadent empty Buchanan household - and the stench of squandered privilege, crime and death that accompanies it all.The writing is of the highest quality, each sentence perfectly composed and filled with layers making up rich paragraphs and textured pages - it's not hard to see why Fitzgerald is canonised and celebrated when the writing in Gatsby is this good. But that's not to say that it's unreadable to people looking for a good read - it's perfectly approachable, understandable, and fun. The scenes are so full of life and action that it's as compelling to read purely for its story of doomed love between Gatsby and Daisy. The scene between Gatsby, Daisy and Tom is as explosive to read the first time as it is to re-read it again.But because the writing is so good, the story so layered and full of symbols with a strong theme and message, it's no wonder this book has had untold numbers of books and papers written about its complexities and nuances - how truly magnificent a work of art it is. I won't go into the various themes and sub-texts as this review will turn into a sprawling mini-book of its own but suffice it to say Fitzgerald explores the theme of how wealth in America means the rich can do what they want to the poor and the law can't touch you if you have cash, with a wry and precise eye that still has relevance nearly a century after it was written.And why is Gatsby great? Because he is the embodiment of the American Dream - a working class boy who became rich; a self-made man, yet his pursuit of riches and love were all illusions in the end. Riches come and go and love can be fickle and deceitful. In the end, Gatsby represents the poor to Daisy and Tom's rich, and, like the poor paying for the sins of the rich, Gatsby too must pay the ultimate price for attempting to join their ranks.The Great Gatsby is a haunting, bitter, and powerful novel of America's elite and their excesses, a damning yet beautiful work that captures perfectly an era and a class through wonderfully realised characters in an unforgettable story. A modern tragedy that's of its time but for all time, The Great Gatsby continues to enchant readers today and its status as a Great American Novel is well earned. If you've never read this masterpiece, let me be the first to introduce you to Mr Jay Gatsby - he'll take it from here."
1640,Kareem Davis,"With this book it's more of something you have to volunteer to read. It's a book that tells a story within another story. The bigger story was trying to figure out who this mysterious person was, and then it went into a love story. Me personal aren't fond of love stories but this was different. You could always tell that this ""mystery"" would come in to change the whole story or bring another aspect to the story, but in the way that it did made it more interesting. Something that deterred me from the book was at how weak Daisy's role was in the whole book. She was always seemed to be the center of attention. She always had to have drama centered around her. It was like she wanted everything to happened that did, but I have to say that she was unique in her own way. She has this mask showing her innocence, but she has times when her darker side comes out into the world.“And I like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.” A line from Daisy, and it puts my head into a loop. It's one of the times when it seems as if she's wanting to be in control or at least having a sense of what's going on. You don't get the same feel for her when you first meet her and that made her character more dynamic for me. She hides her darker side, the part of her that she tries to hide so badly but it slowly comes out of her. She tries to run from what she feels but that only seemed to make matters worse along the way. Daisy become the person I hated the most, but also loved the most by the end of the book.Overall it was a good read. Well worth the time. The story was compelling, gives a new way of thinking about that time frame, and just a whole new perspective of life before I came around. "
1641,Catherine," Review first posted on my blog, thisisjustabookblog.tumblr.com I've said before that I find it quite intimidating to review older, well-known novels, especially ones that are considered classics, because so many people have done so before me, and I kind of feel that I'm unworthy to do so, or that my opinions aren't really that necessary to add. But I shall give it a go, and see what I come up with. Fitzgerald has a wonderful command of the English language, and he can paint the scenes better than almost anyone else I've ever read. His descriptions are exquisite, and you can picture absolutely everything that's going on with such clarity. It's so exciting to read books like this, and such a pleasure too. This book is tragic, and I think the reason it resonated so much with me was because we are all, at heart, dreamers. And this book in the end showed a disillusionment with dreams. Gatsby was the ultimate dreamer, who had an 'extraordinary gift for hope', who fought his way up from the bottom to attain what he wants most - Daisy. And he fails. In the end, she chooses someone else, not because she doesn't love Gatsby (in my opinion, anyway), but because she was too timid, too meek to choose a life with someone who wasn't from 'old money'. She couldn't overcome the class boundaries.At first, I wasn't sure whether to like Gatsby or not, but the scene where he meets Daisy clinched it for me. The line, 'Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of water, glaring tragically into my eyes', not only made me laugh, but also made me like him, as the whole scene did, because it completely showed how much he loved Daisy, even if it was to unhealthy levels of obsession. And the ending just killed me. The tragedy of it all, the knowledge that she chose Tom and then Gatsby's death and the fact that no one bothered to come to his funeral - I shared Nick's anger that so many hundreds of people would come to his house week after week to party, and no one could make it to the funeral. And Daisy not coming was unforgivable of her, in my eyes. It was what really made me decide that I disliked her (not as a character, just as a person, if that makes sense?). Nick seemed to believe that Gatsby died with the idea that Daisy wasn't going to ring, that he had realised the impossibility of his dream, but I kind of hope that he died with hope. I really enjoyed this book, and I hope you all read it and enjoy it too! "
1642,Emily Rath,"Wonderful book! This is a story about a man named Nick Carraway who recently moved to New York to find out more about bond business. Nick soon discovers that his new neighborhood isn't quite as it seems. Nick finds out that his neighbor, Gatsby, is in love with a friend of his, Daisy. Daisy is married to Tom, but Tom is having an affair with another woman. Gatsby and Daisy eventually fall in love and what happens at the end of the book is tragic. Read to find out why! The genre of this book is Fiction. I rated this book a five because it was one of the books I didn't want to put down. I had to see what happened next. This book was full of mysterious secrets and lavish lifestyles. The dominant themes in this book are love, betrayal, power, and greed. This book would be appropriate for grades 9-12. "
1643,Ghiwa Abi Haidar,"I read this book twice and I can finally say that i found my favorite book. I think I'm obsessed with Gatsby the character as much as nick is. I love Gatsby and everything about him and i give Scott a 5/5 for how he made me so attached to a fictional character. A piece of art. The language, the style, and everything is pretty amazing and deep. A must read for every person out there because everyone should meet Gatsby to learn, everyone should meet every character in this book because every character represents reality and this is how this book will make you learn a lot. Very tragic, but it will make you realize that everyone of us is pursuing something and is reaching for a green light. I wish i can meet a Gatsby in real life. "
1644,Ibtissam,one word : PERFECT
1645,Phan Yến,"""Khi con của em ra đời, em hỏi y tá đó là trai hay gái. Và cô ta nói đó là một bé gái. Em thấy thật nhẹ nhõm, vì em vui đó là một bé gái. Và em hi vọng nó sẽ thật ngốc. Đó là điều tuyệt nhất một cô gái có thể trở thành trong thế giới này. Một cô gái xinh đẹp ngốc nghếch."""
1646,Katie,"Loved this novel. Who hasn't been obsessed, at one point, at recapturing a lost love? We've all been there. Set against the glamour of New York and the tears beneath the glitter, I found it captivating. The descriptions of Gatsby's parties and the social interactions were eye opening and I soon noticed parallels in my own life (albeit far less expensive ones). Having Nick as a subjective narrator was also interesting, as his presumptions of Gatsby's feelings raised questions for me to find the answer for myself. The only 'real' love is between Myrtle and Tom, an immoral, adulterous love that is killed. That, coupled with Gatsby's strong, unrequited love and Tom and Daisy's artificial, selfish love leaves you with mixed feelings about relationships. In 20th Century, Upper Class America, previous social boundaries had been thrown out the window with open, passionate affairs and marriage became merely a function to help both parties. Perhaps that's always been the way? Any road, in Gatsby's case, the nice guy finishes last and his pays a 'high price' for his obsession. Perhaps the moral is more 'carpe diem' than anything else."
1647,Krystianna,NEW FAVORITE. REVIEW TO COME. 
1648,Simon,"I was attracted to this classic novel by its ending, which I had been introduced to by David Pettigrew in his creative writing class at the University of Strathclyde. I was moved by its sentiment that, however much our past draws us back and however hard we may try to recreate it, the past is over and has forever gone. When I was then mesmerised by Tobey Maguire and Leonardo Di Caprio's performance in Baz Luhrmann's spectacular filming of ""the Great Gatsby"", I had to read the novel. This proved easy to do as it is more of a novelette or extended short story. The film is unexpectedly faithful to F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, to the extent that I could easily visualise its episodes as the story unfolds. Fitzgerald brilliantly evokes the glittering and fickle world of America's Jazz Age. The tragedy of Jay Gatz's success story, as he mysteriously rises from poverty to great wealth, is that its sole purpose is based on a false hope. Jay's past idyll with Daisy can never be more than a memory, however much money he throws at making it their future. A true classic and a pleasure to read."
1649,Ellen Ward,"Summary:F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is an American classic about achieving the ultimate American dream, wealth, and how there is so much more to the lifestyle than just the fancy things. As the story goes, Nick Carraway has just moved to New York to learn about business. He rents a house in the wealthy area of Long Island. He knows some people there. His beautiful cousin, Daisy and her cheating husband, Tom, both live close by in the wealthy town of West Egg. Nick meets a very interesting woman, Jordan, and he learns about Tom's affair with a woman named Myrtle. Soon enough, Nick gets an invitation to Daisy and Tom's neighbor, Jay Gatsby's house. Gatsby is an extremely successful man who loves to throw extravagant parties. Nick gets to know Gatsby and they become close friends. Nick learns that Gatsby is deeply in love with Daisy, and he has been ever since he met her. He often looks to the green light across the water to where Daisy lives to see if he can see her. Gatsby asks Nick to arrange a meeting for him and Daisy. Nick does, and their romance is rekindled. It is as if they never left each other. Everything is wonderful until Tom learns of this affair. Tom is angry, and he and Nick go to meet Gatsby in the city, where he tells Daisy that Tom is a criminal and earns his money illegally. Daisy ultimately chooses her husband, but goes back West Egg with Gatsby. Daisy is driving, and she is so upset that she accidently hits Myrtle with a car and kills her. Gatsby takes the blame for this, and Myrtle's husband goes to Gatsby's house and shoots him. Gatsby was getting a phone call, at the end, that he thinks is from Daisy, but it is really from Nick. The book ends with Nick at Gatsby's very small funeral. Nick is sad, and he realized that the American dream and wealth is not at all what he thought it was. My Response:I am glad I finally got to read this book. It is amazing, and I also watched the new movie with Leonardo DiCaprio. They are both amazing! There are many aspects I love about this book. First, I love that extravagant aspect to the story. Gatsby throws wonderful parties, Daisy is elegant, and the mansions are extraordinary. Everything in grand! Gatsby character is intriguing to me. At first, he is so mysterious. We do not know a lot about him, except through what others have said about him. Nick is so intrigued by the man that he must find out more. Learning that Gatsby has acquired all of his things for Daisy and throws all of his huge parties for her too really shows the kind of man Gatsby is deep inside. He is a hopeless romantic, and all of the worldly things mean nothing to him. It is Daisy's returning love that will truly make Gatsby a happy man. I found Daisy's character interesting. I do not necessarily like her, though. At first, readers feel sorry her, because we think that she truly wants to be with Gatsby, but she is in a hard situation. At the end, she does not seem like she cares as much as she should care when Gatsby dies. She decides to stay with Tom because she is a rational person, not a person that lives for love, like Gatsby is. I admire Nick's character, because he is a good man. He cares about Gatsby, and he learns a lot about life through Gatsby's story. Another thing I love so much about this story is that it takes place in 1920s America, right before The Great Depression. Business was flourishing, and a ""happy-go-lucky"" theme is definitely felt in the setting. This is a book I could teach in American Literature. I can't wait to teach this book, and I definitely plan to!Questions:1. Daisy ultimately picks to stay with Tom despite their lack of ""fire"" in the relationship, and the fact that Tom cheats on her. Why would she pick this life over being with Gatsby?2. Gatsby devotes his entire life to win back Daisy. Is this a representation of love, or a is Gatsby's character supposed to represent something else in American society?3. Nick learns a lot about life from Gatsby. Does he remain bitter? Is this reaction supposed to represent the consequences of wealthy society? "
1650,Erin Hoffman,"Listened to this on audiobook recently (terrific Jake Gyllenhal reading). I feel strongly now that this book should not be taught in high school. I actively disliked it when it was jammed into the heavy-handed image analysis and stilted interpretation of theme watered down for adolescents, so it took me years to try it again and I would not have except for the new Baz Lurhmann film coming out (after Moulin Rouge I'll follow him anywhere). It's a stunning book, so precisely crafted, its emotional core so completely taut. And there is just no dimension by which it is a good book for most teens."
1651,Isabelle Eastham," I really loved this book. This novel takes place in New York City during the 1920s,also known as, the Roaring Twenties.It is because of this book I love this era so much... with all the flappers, speakeasies, bootlegging, jazz etc. its amazing to think America really went through such a transformation to this day. The novel includes an entangling of relationships that brings all the characters together. Fitzgerald's novel teaches many important lesson about being wealthy, friendship and love. One lesson I learned is, being rich is not the best thing in the world because when you are rich, it is hard to tell whether your friends are ""true"" friends or are they friends because of the money. Not only friendship, but also with love. It would be hard to determine whether your lover loves you for who you actually are or just for your money.  The main theme of this novel is not the typical, ""money doesn't buy you happiness"", it reflects the falling away of the American Dream in the era. The character of Jay Gatsby throws brilliant parties every Saturday for his guests who have never seen him and no one knows anything about him or how he mad his comfortable fortune. Gatsby's life is truly a mystery that is gradually unraveled by Nick Carraway. Nick is the narrator, also the neighbor to Gatsby's intimidating mansion in West Egg. Nick is the cousin of Daisy Buchanan, the long lost love of Gatsby, however she is married unhappily to Tom Buchanan, an awful man. Another interesting Character, and a personal favorite, is Jordan Baker. Nick falls romantically in love with her. Jordan is supposed to represent ""new person"" of the 1920's. All-in-all Fitzgerald work is truly admirable and is to be read deeply and can be interpreted widely. I believe everyone should read this book! "
1652,Lealdo,"Um romance ideal para, já tendo sido devidamente lido, chegar em casa bêbado ma non troppo e abrir ao acaso qualquer página. Porque a única coisa que me importou e me importa aqui é a escrita, e, Great Scott, que escrita é essa. Não é o livro mais ambicioso que eu já li, ou o mais inteligente, ou o mais engraçado, ou o mais tocante. Mas é, sem muitas outras alternativas, o mais redondo. Não acreditei em momento algum na veracidade de Nick, Daisy ou, se quiser mesmo saber, Gatsby. Todos que morram afogados em Veuve Clicquot. Desde a primeira frase, porém, acreditei na prosa de Fitzgerald, e é desse livro o que eu guardo e espalho."
1653,Robert Schwab,"I read it every year. The writing is absolutely beautiful, and Gatsby is the loneliest man ever."
1654,Ela,"I was hooked, moved and infuriated. This was simply a pleasure to read.(2nd time round I loved it even more, and I now have a beautiful cover to match the beautiful words!)"
1655,Hannah Maynard,"The Great Gatsby is as captivating of a novel as Gatsby himself. The book is being told as it is being written by Nick Carraway, friend and neighbor of Gatsby. Nick moved to West Egg from the Midwest in hope of a career. Instead, he got himself caught in a tragic love triangle. Across from West Egg in East Egg lived his cousin, Daisy, and her husband Tom. Nick traveled over one day for lunch where he met Jordan Brown, professional golfer, and learned of Tom's mistress, Myrtle, who was disrupting their pleasant lunch. Back in West Egg, Nick was always curious to the massive parties that went on at the mansion next door. Much to his surprise he received an invitation to one of the parties from Gatsby himself. As Nick attended the party he finally was able to pinpoint this Gatsby and met up with Jordan again. Jordan had been summoned by Gatsby. After the party, Gatsby and Nick spent lots of time together. It was because of Gatsby he met up with Jordan again, but it was all ironic. Gatsby needed a favor and Jordan was the one who needed to ask. Gatsby had told Jordan why and for who he threw these parties. Daisy. She was the reason. Gatsby didn't just know Daisy, he was in love with her. Gatsby purposely bought the house to be exactly across the river from her's. He hoped that one day she would wonder in for a party, but she never did. Gatsby asked Jordan to have Nick invite her over for tea. Nick did, and Gatsby also attended. They hit it off again after not seeing each other since he was back from war. Gatsby closed his house to parties, as she was the only one to come in and out. The became lovers once again. Gatsby finally invited Daisy and Tom to a party at this one day. There Tom caught on to Daisy and Gatsby. Daisy finally thought she was ready to tell Tom, so she invited him, Nick, and Jordan over for support. As they all went town, turmoil spiked between Tom and Gatsby. The cat came out of the bag and everyone went mad. Tom made everyone leave. As they all headed home and women came running at the car Daisy and Gatsby were in. It was Myrtle thinking that Tom was driving the car since she had seen him earlier driving that same car. While trying to swrive around her, Daisy hit her with the car but they didn't stop. Back at Daisy's house, her and Tom worked it out while Gatsby waited at his house for her to call. She never called, instead was leaving with Tom. Before they left, Tom was approached by Myrtle's husband, Wilson, seeing as they were friends. He wanted to know who hit her, and Tom said Gatsby. Wilson showed up at Gatsby's place and shot him and then shot himself. This left Nick with all the memories and the wondering of what could of been of Daisy and Gatsby. The purpose and theme of this book go side by side. The theme is to never give up on the ones you love. In the book Gatsby never gave up on Daisy. After years on not being with her, he did all he could to get her back. In the end when he did, bad stuff happened; but he then tried once again to get her back. This book shows how fighting for the ones we love can have either a positive or negative outcome, but in the end will forever make the person happy. To be with the one you love and to see the happy at the end of the day is one the most important things. So why not try and make that happen.I highly recommend the book. This is one of my favorite books because of all the excitement. I almost peed my pants when I heard it was going to be a movie. I love to read this book every so often because of how much I like it. The dynamics of the different characters versus the story line is why I like it so much. Everyone should read it, not just see the movie."
1656,Alor Deng,"I said of tender is the night that I didn't think Fitzgerald could outdo himself. In one sense, I am proven right, but only by a hairbreadth. This is a masterpiece and Fitzgerald is a master. His beautiful language separates and makes him stand out from all other American authors. an absolutely gifted writer; there were times, particularly when he described the party scenes that the words practically glittered on the pages."
1657,Lady Poppy,"I'm not sure I can call this a favorite, but it definitely struck a chord in me.That was a horribly sad love story, I must say.Daisy could live a thousand lives and never once deserve Gatsby as a lover."

Dopo essersi trasferito a West Egg, lussuosa zona a pochi chilometri da New York, riallaccia i rapporti con la cugina Daisy Fay, personaggio circondato da una mal celata tristezza e malinconia, sposata con Tom Buchanan, impulsivo e poco fedele campione di polo. Ad una cena presso la casa della cugina, Nick sente nominare per la prima volta il nome di Gatsby, misterioso uomo e vicino di casa che organizza feste nella sua enorme villa. Nei giorni seguenti riceve un invito per le esclusive feste di Gatsby. Nick scoprirà presto alcuni dettagli del passato del suo famoso vicino e trascorrerà ore di eccessi.Un GRANDE Gatsby veramente! Si decide di leggere questo libro per curiositá (dopo aver saputo dell'uscita dell'omonimo film oppure dopo aver apprezzato ""Midnight in Paris""). Avendone sentito parlare sempre a livello scolastico, inizialmente, si può credere che 'Il grande Gatsby' sia la solita lettura classica e noiosa. Niente di tutto questo! Il capolavoro di Scott Fitzgerald è un romanzo che é il ritratto degli anni '20 americani e di un uomo circondato da 'amici' festaioli ma realmente solo, ma anche una possibile autobiografia dell'autore che ridipinge tutti i suoi anni senza freni.Un libro, quindi, consigliato a tutti ma soprattutto a coloro che hanno intenzione di vedere l'adattamento cinematografico del 2013, per avere così un'idea corretta della trama senza lasciarsi influenzare dalle scene del film, apprezzandone o meno la fedeltà."
1659,Astineman15,"If there are any specific three things to take away from the novel The Great Gatsby, they would certainly be:1) Emotion, not granduer, is what makes up human life- Pay special attention to the juxtaposition of magnificent parties and acute emotional distress/strange occurrences2) Money ultimately does not fly above love in human experiences- ""Her voice is full of money,"" very stirring moment in the book3) Friendships, though perhaps not always liked or supported by others, can be the most powerful things in the world- Nick's commitment to Gatsby at the end of the novel was another image that will remain in my mind when looking back to this novel"
1660,David Gallagher,"Probably one of the greatest novels I ever had the luck to read. Fitzgerald's language is flawless, magical and poetic - his descriptions and character outlining utterly wonderful. A book I'd suggest hands down with my hand on my heart - I absolutely love everything about it: its tragedy, its beauty, its ending, its ironic title. "
1661,Brieanna Galindo,To me this book was simply amazing!I would highly recommend it to anyone and would definitely read it again. Although it is a bit hard to picture and understand at first it does get exciting a becomes a very worthy read. Please watch it before the movie so it does not get spoiled! 
1662,Katie Hammitt,"The Great Gatsby is one of the greatest books of all time. It is written from the perspective of Nick Carraway, who decided to rent a house in the ""West Egg"" of New York.This house is neighboring the home of the mysteriously wealthy Jay Gatsby. Gatsby throws wild parties every weekend, but never comes out to enjoy them. It turns out that the reason he had these parties were an attempt to reunite with his long lost love, Daisy. She was now married to another man, but Gatsby was so in love with her, and her new husband barely noticed her. In fact, for most of the book, he had a ""woman in the city."" This book is a love story. It is a tale of romance, facing all of the hardships brought about by the obstacles of wealth and luxury.This is the second time that I have read this book, and I loved it just as much as I did the first time. It is so intriguing, and approaches love in a way that no other book I have read does. It shows the good and the bad behind falling in love, and how difficult it can be to make a good thing work."
1663,Megan,One of my favorite books of all time... truly the 'Great American Novel'.
1664,ajaleyah taylor,"i decided to read this book because i had recently seen the film and thought that the book might be interesting to read.i was not disappointed. i also thought that films usually miss out important things that happen in the books and that i could see what was missing. to my suprise there was nothing missing the book and film were practicly the same. the categorie this book fits in to is a book written before 1950. to my suprise. this categorie for me was one of the hardest and i find only book very hard to read but when i found out the great gatsby was written before the 1950s i was set on reading it as i loved the film. the categorie was also interesting because it teaches us what life was like in the past and how people lived. my favorite quote in the book is ""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly in to the past"" this quote is the very last sentence in the book and it is significant because it ,to me means that after all the scandle and drama everyone dead or alive moved on and life went on as normal like nothing had happened at all. something new i learnt from this book is that you think you know someone and then they do something that you wouldn't think they would normally do and then you might consider how much or little you actually know them and what you don't know about them and you never find out what you didn't know aboutbecause its too late.a setting i found really interesting was the whole era the book was set in.people partied all the time and dressed amazingly. if i could i would have loved to have had lived in that era as it sounds lovely and exciting."
1665,Jaevie,"""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.""Amazing. The characters, the plot, the narration, and the execution was brilliant. A must-read.I put this up with the known classics like Anna Karenina or Gone with the Wind.F. Scott Fitzgerald is just a wonderful writer. His prose and dialogue is just awe-worthy in this time."
1666,Doan,"I wanted to read the book again because I don't remember too much of it from high school. It was very stirring. I didn't remember a thing. Now, I can watch the movie when it comes out. "
1667,Ryan Chu,"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."
1668,Tammy,"I only read it because I have to teach it - but - I'm glad I read it and I'm sorry that I haven't read and taught it before. The students will hate it at first because it's ""work."" I will cross my fingers for bright moments of illumination. "
1669,Bryan,"My sixth book is finished and I'm only three months into the project. Let's see, that's fifty months to finish the list, so I should be done sometime in January of 2014. That seems so far away.Gatsby is simply put, a good book. I enjoy the story, the characters, the setting, everything. It all seems so real to me when I read it. It's one of those books I just seem to get lost in so to speak. I suppose that is a testament to how well written it is and what a good book it really is. There's no mystery as to why this one is on the list and no mystery as to why it is probably in every English department's curriculum in the country. The book follows Nick Carraway, a young mid-westerner who has moved to New York to learn the bond business. He rents a house on Long Island, next door to the mysterious and intriguing, and filthy rich, Jay Gatsby.Unlike many of the other people in Nick's life, Gatsby doesn't come from old money. His money comes from an unknown source, presumably bootlegging, and he is a living embodiment of the 'American dream'; coming from so low to so high in such a short period of time. However, as Nick becomes closer to Gatsby, he learns of the man's motivations and ultimately his fate, and realizes that being wealthy doesn't necessarily mean being happy. When I read that back, I realize it sounds like I'm describing an episode of ""Ducktales,"" where Uncle Scrooge has to decide between spending time with his nephews or acquiring more gold coins, but you know what I mean. In the end, Nick sees the highs and lows of such a life, and decides that his future doesn't lie in New York, chasing that same dream or experiencing a similarly tragic fate.The character of Nick Carraway reminds me of Charles Ryder from Brideshead Revisited. They socialize with people of such fantastic wealth, that they consider themselves to be hard up, even poor. Of course both of them have jobs paying close to nothing, yet at a young age have comfortable lodgings, hire cars, stay at hotels, eat at nice restaurants, etc. Apparently wealth is relative to who you are closest to.It seems strange to learn that this book was one of Fitzgerald's least successful novels. Upon its release, it was critically acclaimed, but performed poorly at the tills. It wasn't until after his death, and a re-release in the early 40's that the book became so very popular and reached the lofty status it still holds today. Fitzgerald never knew the success of Gatsby, and died considering himself a failure as a writer. That speaks to the difficulty in being a fiction writer. Something you work hard at and can be very proud of, doesn't strike the right chord with the public, and you spend your life considering yourself to be a failure.You can read my other reviews here."
1670,Avital,"I am amzed at how interesting it is, although we only learn about Gatsby's love for Daisy in the middle of the book. It says so much about longing and the realization of dreams.How come the reader becomes so involved with the characters and the plot even before anything happens? (A smart friend said:It's focused, to the point, there's nothing that needs to be put in or taken out, the language is beautiful, the central dilemma is tragic and truthful, the social commentary is spot on and the plot is allusive and works on many levels.) "
1671,Paula Schumm,Love this one!
1672,John Doe,"The best dialogue in the whole book was:""Gatsby is an Oxford man.""""The hell he is! He is wearing a pink suit."""
1673,Liz Vega,"I thought it was perfect. There is such poignancy to the descriptions that Nick, the narrator provides. Beautiful words, and descriptions that will stay with me forever. Even though it takes place in the 20's it could be anytime in America, full of possibilities, chasing the elusive dream. The Great Gatsby is a tragic story and I think that we can all relate to it because we have all been there at one time or another, wanting something and then realizing that perhaps we should have never wanted that in the first place. I kept hoping that Gatsby would live up to his name, the Great Gatsby and like a top-biller on a show, I was rooting for him but that never happens. It is a book that could very well leave you unsatisfied but doesn't because you know from the beginning, from the nostalgic way in which Nick Carraway tells the story that this is not one with a happy ending. It felt real. and you got a glimpse into the souls of so many of its characters. I once was told by a dear friend that I was like Daisy, and as I read of her character, her vapid thoughts, her voice full of money, I kept thinking, something would happen that would redeem Daisy. She is just careless, nothing redeeming about her except that she's a good-time girl. I really hope my friend was joking and it was only the fact that I like a good party that brought Daisy Buchanan to mind. "
1674,Ms.,"The Great Gatsby by F.Scott Fitzgerald is an extraordinary portrayal of the American Dream and its discontents. I empathize with Gatsby's drive for success and how it ultimately isolates him from what he truly wants. Gatsby grew up poor always reaching for things that were just barely withing his grasp. Once he reaches the pinnicale of sucess (as the result of some shady dealings), Gatsby buys a mansion accross the harbor from Daisy, the love of his life. Early in the story Gatsby conveniently bumps into Daisy and their precarious relationship begins to develop. I love the way in which Fitzgerald uses color to highlight the character traits of the characters in The Great Gatsby. For example, Daisy is always described dressed in pinks and baby blues demonstrating her fragile feminity , while Gatsby is always dressed in gentleman's white emphasizing his powerful position in society. Ending tragically, The Great Gatsby, is a story about an American tragic hero who achieves success, but not happiness. "
1675,Jaclyn,This was a great story and beautifully written. I am in love with it! I will definitely be reading more of F. Scott Fitzgerald.
1676,Mel Vincent,"This book shows how different the ""Jazz Age"" was and how the people were back then. Everything in this book was very exciting and I enjoyed reading every page of it. The dialogue and the plot of the story was very easy to follow and understand and the characters were the embodiments of the people of that era in American History. The way it was written also very articulately and eloquently done and it was both smart and very funny at the same time. It showed us that during those days, everything was glamorous and very energetic. It also showed that parties were at its zenith in those days and life literally was a party. I liked how the narrator and Jay Gatsby came together in the story and how these two characters seemed to be the essence and the foundation of the entire novel. The differences between these men was gave a humorous and an eventful plot which kept me at the edge of my seat. I was just surprised why Gatsby had to die and I felt that the ending parts of the novel was kind of hanging in a way but still it was done very well I might add. I could not even stop reading the novel and it was very intriguing and entertaining all the way to the end. An amazing novel, it is truly a classical masterpiece and it truly embodies the ""American Novel""."
1677,Clive Hendelson,"Craving for a new novel with fascinating characters and a mystery plot? I recommend that you take a look at The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, if you haven’t already. The Great Gatsby is a great choice if you are looking for a short novel to read during your downtime. In my opinion, Fitzgerald creates a wonderfully detailed novel through the use of the contrasting ideals associated with passion and actuality. A LITTLE SPOILER-----------------------The entangled mess of love triangles makes this book great. Gatsby is in love with Daisy, who is married to Tom, who is having an affair with Myrtle Wilson, who is married to George. Did you follow that? Not knowing who will end up with whom is exciting.These relationship triangles lead to a dramatic climax involving fights and rash decisions. I like how New York City then and now are not very different. People are up at all hours of the day and night. The story might have been set more than 80 years ago, but it could have happened today.-----------------------For a short novel, I would have to say it is quite compelling, due to its strong character development, vivid imagery, and controversial undertones.Overall, the plot is dramatic and enthralling . . .I've read that The Great Gatsby has been filmed five times already (the latest will be premiered at the end of this month)."
1678,Mark,"I'll write a full review in a bit. I want to let this sink in after my third read of it, the first two being easily a decade ago and possibly a decade apart from one another."
1679,Austin,"	The Great Gatsby written by F. Scott Fitzgerald is the story of dazed loves told from the perspective of Nick Carraway. A midwesterner who comes to live Long Island in hopes to start a career as a bonds salesman in Manhattan. Nick who rents out a small house for the summer in West Egg lives through the fatal love story of Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan. Nick's cousin Daisy lives across the lake in a very luxurious mansion with her wealthy husband Tom Buchanan. Tom a very successful businessman and Caraways old Yale college roommate is also a very unfaithful husband, we learn of this when we are first introduced to them at their mansion. Due to some “secret” phone calls from a mysterious someone. Also when Tom takes Nick out for a day in the city, where Nick learns that Tom has been having an affair with a woman named Myrtle. Living next door to Nick in his overwhelming Mansion is the great and mysterious Jay Gatsby. After being invited to one of Mr. Gatsbys notorious parties Nick soons learn that Gatsby is in love with Daisy Buchanan. Gatsby sends a message through golfer Jordan Baker, also Nicks friend. That he sets up a way for Jay and Daisy to meet in private. Through this experience we learn that Jay Gatz at the time and Daisy had once been in love when they were young. But went to the war and Daisy wanted a wealthy man in her life, something Jay didn’t have. Jay Gatz abandoned his old identity becoming Jay Gatsby and created an amassing fortune for himself with the help of criminal Meyer Wolfsheim. From all his wealth Gatsby makes his mansion in Long Island because it is across the bay from Daisy's house. After meeting Jay and Daisy begin to see each other secretly and start to rekindle the flame that once burned so bright. When Tom suspects this he confronts Jay about this in Manhattan, and the two men argue for quite awhile about who Daisy loves more. Creating mixed emotions Daisy claims she loves both the men, but decides she will return to Long Island with Gatsby in his car. Daisy who decides to drive hits a woman running out in the road. After hitting her she speeds away and we learn that the woman was Myrtle Toms girlfriend. She had ran out in the road to see the car because she thought it was Toms. Blaming the death on Tom Myrtle's husband is completely devastated. But Tom tells Myrtle's husband that it wasn’t him that it was Gatsby. Jay decides he wants to keep this a secret and have everyone think that it is him to protect Daisy. The mechanic goes to Gatsby’s house with a pistol intending to kill Gatsby which he does by the pool and then offs himself. Refusing to confess to her crime Daisy lets Gatsbys legacy fall apart with the only one caring of it is Nick. When it comes to Gatsby's funeral the only person besides Nick that came was Henry Jay’s father. From reading The Great Gatsby it’s clear we are seeing throughout the story the power of love. 	As the story continues we learn of the love that Jay and Daisy once had when they were young. But she couldn’t be with someone in her eyes that didn’t have money. Going off to the war Jay used this to create an escape from his old life and to a new one. Motivated by how much he loved Daisy Jay wanted to be able to give everything to Daisy that he thought that she deserved. By buying a huge house and all the luxuries that come with it he wanted to please her. “He hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes, too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way as though in actual astounding presence none of it was any longer real.” (Fitzgerald, pg 112). This scene shows not only the readers but Daisy how high of a caliber his love was for her. He had changed his life paid and bought all of these things his house, jewelry, cars, all of the people that worked for him. He did all of that to live up to Daisy’s expectations she had created all those years ago. Through those years and not being in contact with her his love for her never died. Clearly showing how the power of love had a grip on Jay Gatsby's heart. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby and when it came out it wasn’t that successful. It wasn’t till many years after he was dead did the novel become a huge hit and became an amazing rendition of the book in multiple movies. Through those years the book and films showed the other side of love, the not so nice side. I personally Love this book and the movie and just the story. but at some times in the plot I just don’t like how things happen. Like when Daisy doesn’t admit to her crime, because it defeats and diminishes Gatsby’s whole legacy he had worked so hard to create. I feel that when this happens and after Gatsby is dead and no one shows up to his funeral it creates a strong emotional impact. Because it truly does show how alone he was and how he didn’t care for anyone and didn't care what he had to do to receive the love he wanted from Daisy. But on the other hand I feel that it could have made it stronger if we saw someone like Daisy at his funeral, to show in a way her apology for what she had done to his legacy and more importantly being the reason why he was dead. However, throughout the story Fitzgerald lets us in on how powerful love can be. He does this with his character in the book. But Fitzgerald lived this himself with his wife Zelda and he portrays in it in this book. As readers we learn how love can truly be the most amazing thing and motivates us to do things we never dreamt of. But with that comes heartbreak and sorrow. People feel these thing everyday in life and it is something that will never go away. That’s why even though this story was written many years ago, took place in the 1920’s, and Fitzgerald is dead it’s message is everlasting. It will forever be able to relate to the lives of millions.

1680,Lane Wilkinson,"Hey, it's me again...'The Great Gatsby'....Remember? From 10th grade? The jeremiad about Jazz Age decadence? The litmus-test for all 20th-century American novels? West Egg? Nick Carraway? Rampant classism and clandestine romance? Remember...?Oh...all you remember is 'West Egg'? For shame...I was a novel before Cliffs Notes were even invented, dude. I suggest you call up Mrs. Mulcahy and ask her to remind you why she assigned me in the first place."
1681,Jeff,"F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is a mystery both in its enormous popularity as well as its plot, which slowly reveals the identity and character of the enigmatic self-made millionaire Jay Gatsby. For an enduring classic, the novel is a rather short read and yet it tells its grand story in efficiently colorful prose in approximately 200 pages. Nick Carraway is the narrator, a former soldier of the First World War from the mid-west who seeks fortune in the bonds business in the East. His modest waterfront rental house in Long Island stands in the shadow of the glittering Gatsby mansion, where outrageous parties burst and crackle like fireworks all night, but its proprietor remains oddly elusive from view. Late one evening Carraway finally sees the stylishly-dressed man of 30 who stares out at the harbor where across the water a green light burns off a dock. Gatsby appears almost hypnotized by this light, and Carraway even thinks he saw the man ""trembling"". The green light is a beacon to Gatsby, representing an enchanted but far away hope of love and romance. Gatsby is a dreamer, and everything he possesses down to his silk shirts contributes to his fantastic and artificial dreamscape. Daisy Buchanan, Nick's cousin, is a young attractive woman from Chicago, married to the hard-nosed and humorless womanizer Tom Buchanan. Yet Daisy has dreams of her own. The Buchanans' entanglement with Gatsby is ever fascinating and must be experienced first hand, so for those readers who have hesitated about Fitzgerald's book, waste no more time and open it up and allow its remarkable prose to sweep you away. Audio editions on CD and MP3 also bring The Great Gatsby to life. I especially appreciate the audio version read by Alexander Scourby whose pitch-perfect tone nails the self-effacing and carefully observant narrative voice of Nick Carraway.Despite achieving must-read and classic status today, The Great Gatsby wasn't particularly popular when released in the mid 1920's; perhaps readers found its themes of excessive wealth and moral poverty skirted too close to home during the flaunted extravagance of post-World War One Prohibition Era, where more booze was poured and downed than any other time in American history. The partying went on and on, and a man could collect wheel barrels of dollars on the Stock Market and other risky ventures, until with the Crash of 1929 the party lights abruptly burst. The Great Gatsby prophetically anticipates the dark side of lavish wealth that brought on the 1930's Depression, but it also warns of empty hope and frivolous dreams that can seduce a man from modest origins like Gatsby. Today, the novel always ranks highly on readers' favorites lists, and its prose often feels as fresh as the first time we encounter Daisy Buchanan: ""Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice, that men who had cared for her found it hard to forget, a whispered 'Listen', a promise that she had done gay exciting things just a while since and that there were gay exciting things hovering in the next hour."" Fitzgerald fills his novel with so many breathlessly exquisite passages like this one, the novel is a near-perfect feast of literary delight. "
1682,Emma N,"Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is a intriguing novel that takes place during the 1920s. Through Nick, the narrator, the reader is able to get an insightful experience of the wealth, the parties, and a love story rooted in the past. The Great Gatsby is one of the most popular books in US Literature and is definitely worth reading. "
1683,Triisha Trivadachi,"I would have liked it, except we had to analyze it a million times in English class (bleh). Honestly, if I'd read it on my own, it would have been okay. Definitely not as good as other classics, like Pride and Prejudice, or The Time Machine, in my opinion, and I still prefer novels from this century. But it was fine."
1684,Denis,"It was about time I re-read The Great Gatsby - which I had only read in French so far, so in a way, reading it in English at last was like reading it for the first time. Which is quite a feast. Everything has been said and written about this novel. For good reasons. It is, still today, in my opinion, one of the most resonant, brilliant, magical, fascinating pieces of literature of the XXth century - and certainly one of the greatest American novels ever. The writing is exquisite; nobody writes like Fitzgerald when he's at his best, and his prose is as intoxicating as perfume, or as one of the summer nights he so wonderfully describes. Deceptively simple, the story is actually extraordinarily complex, elusive, multi-leveled, and metaphoric - I'm sure that, with each reading, you can see something new in it, be it just a poignant love story, or the most devastating portrait ever written of the American dream (which is really only that, as the book shows: a dream). I was struck, when rediscovering the enchantments of that novel, by how heartbreaking the enigmatic character of Jay Gatsby is. The whole novel is infused with a sadness, an ache that are haunting. Gatsby's quest for a Graal he'll never capture is our own - and it is maybe what makes this book, so much anchored in the world if the twenties, timeless and universal at the same time. "
1685,Sani Evans,"“They’re a rotten crowd,” I shouted across the lawn. “You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together.”I’ve always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time.”"
1686,Behnam Riahi,"The following review has been copied from http://behnamriahi.tumblr.comThe Great Gatsby, written by F. Scott Fitzgerald and published by Wordsworth Classics, is a plain-spoken novel, set from the first-person point-of-view of Nick Carraway, bonds salesman. Of course, Nick isn't the protagonist--when he comes to New York from Chicago, Nick is reunited with his cousin Daisy and her emotionally infantile husband, Tom in old money East Egg of Long Island. It's when Daisy's best friend, Jordan, utters rumors of a man named Gatsby that our story begins. Living next door to Nick in a lavish mansion, Gatsby is said to be the one throwing parties every night that shake up new money West Egg and when Nick is invited to the party unexpectedly, he finds Jordan again and a man who recognizes Nick from the war: The millionaire extraordinaire they call Jay Gatsby. But Gatsby is more than he appears and as he stares at the green light on the horizon, Nick can't possibly imagine how Gatsby's unrequited love over the course of a single summer would change their lives forever--a love so strong, it exceeds love itself, for it is a dedication of one man and the lengths he will go in order to perpetuate that love.This is my third and hopefully not final read of The Great Gatsby. This copy was given to me by my brother and has seen a lot of use--once while living in rural Illinois, once for a creative writing class, and once again, now, for the sake the motion picture's release. I think even Wyatt read it once. Every time I read it though, I take something new of this story--it's a novel that never bores, because with each read, something precious of it that might have easily been glanced over bleeds through. Because I've been so absorbed in this book throughout my life, let's just say that some elements of it bleed into my own novel, even to a point where one character says, ""I'm the Great fucking Gatsby."" I assume my novel will need a lot of luck in order to get published. In any case, because of the film's release, I'll also be including a little review on the film from the point-of-view of one who so thoroughly enjoyed this novel.As far as The Great Gatsby goes, it's short. There are too few books of this magnitude with so few words, the one that most quickly comes to mind being Slaughterhouse-Five. However, like The Diamond as Big as the Ritz, this is a story about how love and wealth rarely, if ever, accompany each other. In order to offset the narrator, Nick's lack of importance, Fitzgerald remains distant from Nick's life for the most part. We don't learn about his family all that much, we don't get too many models about what's going on with him, and most of the things he experiences alone tend to frame events that happen as a result of the time he spends with Gatsby and attaining a deeper understanding of him. As a result we learn Gatsby's whole life story but we hardly know a thing about Nick. The strange juxtaposition is valuable to the story in that Gatsby's the one that everyone is drawn to, whom everyone pays attention to because of his money--as the story unfolds, he slowly tells more of his own story about how he accumulated his riches, but Nick, with no one badgering at him to want to know anything of him, keeps his own life to himself, sharing only what he must in order to help perpetuate the legend of Gatsby itself, as if orally passing on his account of the events of the novel.Despite Nick's narrative distance, his life tends to be a reflection of Gatsby. Like a ripple on a pond from a tossed stone, his happiness seems to expand forth as a result of those around him. As Gatsby grows closer to grasping Daisy again, Nick and Jordan's romance flourishes. Likewise, when Gatsby's lost all hope of reaching Daisy, Nick and Jordan part ways and separate from each other forever. Even when Gatsby isn't the character that Nick is following and instead, Tom is, as he takes to bed with his mistress, Nick finds himself involved in short, deviant (by 1920's standards? Yeah) homosexual affair with a married man. It's as if Nick is so deeply affected by those around him that he acts on their behalf towards the loves he's inclined to. Mirroring the ambition and betrayal of those around him as a result, we get a much richer, more vibrant emotion to the story that wasn't particularly common in novels of that era (roughly seventy years after Flaubert defined the modern novel with Madame Bovary). Often, authors will use subtle objects and nuances to expand an emotion and though Fitzgerald primarily uses Nick's own parallel feelings, objects do seem to make their way into the story: most notably, the green light that resides on the edge of Daisy's dock and the eyes T.J. Eckleburg. These objects, however, play no tactile sensations for the characters apart from their appearance. While some items that can be held do play a greater role in pushing the emotion and promoting the narrative plot (for instance, Gatsby's letter to Daisy or Tom's telephone), the objects that determine the fate of the characters are more transcendental, so distant that they can't be held but so ever-present that they can't be ignored either. The green light, Gatsby's driving force, has been deemed by literary critics to represent love, money, or the vague idea of the relationship between the two while the T.J. Eckleburg's eyes plastered on a billboard represent the eyes of God, watching down on the poor and helpless while simultaneously staring guiltily as those who consider themselves higher pass by. One might call these metaphors contrived, but parallel to each other, these two represent a greater conflict of the overall novel.And of course, as a common theme in Fitzgerald's works, there are those who consider themselves superior. Much like the family in the short story, The Diamond as Big as the Ritz, Tom looks down on lower people with darker skin-tones, less understated clothing, and just about anyone who didn't come in on the Mayflower. Tom, needless to say, is a racist. The relationship between race and money in this story expands upon Gatsby's own character--for instance, as Gatsby and Nick come rolling into New York city (subsequently after Gatsby simply showed his card to get out of a speeding ticket), they see a car piloted by a white chauffeur with three black people being driven around, as if to illustrate that Gatsby himself is in accordance with the American dream of wealth earned by anyone who wishes to take it, no matter how unpopular that idea was prior to civil rights. In Tom's household, however, all the help are simply made fun of, drawing a unique conflict between those born into money and those that earned it, East Egg and West Egg, the green light and the eyes of God.It's difficult to say more about The Great Gatsby, because unlike most works of great literature, The Great Gatsby simply is what it is--the novel sold a scant 25,000 copies before Fitzgerald died and, between the title and the ending, it seemed as if Gatsby regretted letting the book go to print to begin with. While the novel did become the paramount book defining the roaring twenties, this definition came only during World War II, after Fitzgerald's passing, before it took off and became a worldwide best seller. In that strange way, it would seem as if Fitzgerald was more Gatsby than Carraway after all.I didn't take the time to see the other adaptations, but The Great Gatsby (2013) by Baz Luhrmann is a spectacle. The movie is incessantly beautiful--by far, one of the most beautiful pictures I've seen. It was made in both 3-D and regular-D (lol), but after seeing the movie without the three-dimensional effects, I can't imagine for what reason they made it in 3-D to begin with. However, that's the beginning of one of my issues taken with the film. It's far more violent than the book--at one point, Gatsby seems about to strike Tom in the movie, though the argument they had never elevated to fisticuffs in the book. Why is that important? It changes Daisy's reaction--in the film, she's reacting distantly to Gatsby because he lashed out physically, while in the book, it's more-so because Gatsby kept criminal secrets from her. These moments dramatized well beyond what was initially written in the book have a way of dissolving some of the book's humor too, leaving jokes to fall flat because of over-dramatic delivery. Worse yet, much like the film adaptation of On the Road (2012), the film is framed by the narrator writing the story--as Sal Paradise (instead of Jack Kerouac) wrote On The Road in a way that almost borders on meta-fiction, Nick Carraway writes The Great Gatsby instead of F. Scott Fitzgerald. This especially bothers me because, as an aspiring author myself, I don't really believe that me, Kerouac, or Fitzgerald would want one of our fictional characters taking credit for writing a book we wrote. After all, the characters may hold some similarities to the writer, but fictional characters are all intentionally flawed in ways that we don't recognize in ourselves. If someone framed a film of my novel that way (presuming I actually wrote a book someone thought film-worthy), I can't imagine I would endorse it, no matter the quality of the work being framed. Still, to Fitzgerald's benefit, the quality of the work being framed is quite high. The film, for the most part, sticks to the same dialogue, catching most of the powerful, meaningful phrases that come along in the book. Some are slightly varied to expatiate on the circumstances of the film, but for the most part, they're spot on. Though more dialogue is inevitably added to the film, it only compliments Fitzgerald's original dialogue instead of deviating from the story. In addition to the writing, the movie is beautiful--while Fitzgerald may have given us an idea of how luxurious the parties were, Luhrmann shows it to us in impossibly fantastic glamour, taking much needed liberties on room designs and giving us a much clearer image of the large groups of people and their numbers. While Fitzgerald could say, ""The party was full,"" it doesn't necessarily give us the same idea as if he examined various styles, the way some people stood out against others, or simply dropping some numbers to define amounts of groups. The film, however, shows us clearly, though this is at no fault of Fitzgerald. As a reader, we can only presume the 1920's version of a full-party has fewer people than the subway during rush hour, but Luhrmann's interpretation goes to show that it does not. Like all films made of books, some elements of the novel have been inevitably cut, though I'll keep those to myself should you choose to see the film or read the novel in the near future. I recommend seeing it though--it's not the masterpiece that it had the potential to be, but it's certainly close, distinguished because of it's cast, visuals, and a very fine soundtrack primarily composed of Jay-Z.Edit: In retrospect, the film's use of Walter Chase as a character, one who was not present in the book but nonetheless carries weight in modern times to the credit of his bank, is contrived and should have never made it into the piece. It degenerates the overall ideal of the novel as a commentary on idealization, instead making a social note about corruption that, while it may lie under every Fitzgerald story, exploits the original material to a very hazardous degree, making the overall draw of the story more shallow and less enticing. If you happen to live in Chicago and you're looking for a meal though, I highly recommend checking out Bourgeois Pig Cafe's The Great Gatsby sandwich. In my expert opinion, the sandwich is layered appropriately like the novel. ""Another Big Favorite. Marbled Rye Bread, 1000 Island Dressing, Corned Beef, Sauerkraut, Fresh Tomatoes, Swiss Cheese & Green Leaf Lettuce.Grilled to Perfection."" Sounds better than the film."
1687,Leonor (Ner),"Also published in ""A Cup of Coffee and a Book""I cannot believe it took me so long to read this book. This book was SO good I dare say it’s my second favourite classic… and it’s an American classic (hey, British classics fan, okay?).I read the book after watching Baz Luhrmann’s movie with Leonardo Dicaprio and Tobey Maguire. I enjoyed the movie very much and I left the cinema completely in awe with the story.But the book is so much better, it’s so much deeper and emotional I cannot express how amazed I am.I found the movie rather faithful to the book – or has faithful as you could expect an adaptation to be. Sure there are some scenes and details modified in order to fit the whole cinematographic experience, but being a fan of Moulin Rouge, I expected no less from Luhrmann.But I thought that the main goal of Jay Gatsby story was in it, the love he has for Daisy and everything he did to conquer her back… I only think that Daisy didn’t deserve him in book and movie.And, for me, the beauty of it all is reading Gatsby’s story, how he became the famous man who throws crazy parties, who is rich beyond imagining and who is holding onto hope for something he can no longer reach.And I think that Gatsby’s ability to hope and dream is what makes his story so profound.This is definitely a classic you should all read. It’s a tragic love story set in the 1920’s with an amazing narrator who describes one of the best male characters I ever had the opportunity to read.A must read for sure."
1688,Stephen Robinson," Jordan Baker, I love you."
1689,Sophiarugo," The Great Gatsby is a tale of wonder, and riches,it is saturated with heartbreak; a bright and delicate portrayal of flaring love, being stuck in the past, and painful desperation.  The story is brought to us through the eyes of a young Nick Carraway, in the 1920's. He has just moved to the West Egg, which is near the bright lights of New York city. The only people he knows are his wealthy cousin and her husband, Daisey and Tom Buchanan, who live across the open waters on the East Egg, and his new acquaintance, Jay Gatsby. Gatsby lives next to Nick in a house full of spender who's walls swell with hundreds of party-goers each Saturday night who came for a dance and maybe a glimpse of the elusive millionaire.  Over the course of the novel's 188 pages, Gatsby wilts away looking for a love he once lost and Nick is exposed to Gatsby's world. He learns about the harsh realities of an empty but wealthy heart, and uncovers how he himself will react to life's troubles. All of this happens beneath the backdrop of the roaring twenties,strung up precariously behind to hide the imperfections of the upper class.  I love this book with a passion. The vivid imagery is painted right into the reader's mind and the metaphors and similes make this story a masterpiece. The plot is explosive, and intertwined beautifully, and the ending that ties this book together is exceptional. I would recommend this book to readers of all ages and genres. "
1690,Ms.  Allen,"I love this book so so so so much. I know it's sad and depressing, but it's beautiful. I love the commentary on the American Dream. I may or may not be an American Dream hater--I just feel that it's not all that simple. Sometimes you work your brains out and you don't get everything you ever wanted. Sometimes you work your brains out and you end up right where you started. It's not so perfect and pretty as movies make it seem.I also love how despite all the parties and money, people are still so lonely and empty. We forget that people who have money have just as many problems as those that don't, it's harder to see them and to get them help. The contrast between the physical extravagance and the emotional desert is life changing. It makes you wonder where you allow emptiness into your own lives. Lastly, I love the writing. Fitzgerald is a master, and I am sorry he wasn't appreciated as much as he should have been during his lifetime. His skill with words is so simple, yet so beautiful.EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK!!!!!"
1691,Luise,"5 reasons for 5 points:-Exquisite language,-Enduring themes: the shallowness and futility of the American Dream (if understood as the pursuit of happiness via the ruthless acquisition of material wealth) , the arrogance of wealth, the gaping social divide between the excessively opulent lifestyle of the monied class vs. the struggling, desperate working class.- Continued relevance: it’s not surprising that this classic is gaining renewed attention now - American society is once again at an extreme imbalance (as witnessed by the Occupy movement’s credo of the 99% vs the 1%.)- Blessed brevity: Fitzgerald packs a lot into this small package - interesting characters, an intricate plot, suspense, atmosphere, action, a tragic story of obsessive love with an underlying layer of social critique, all wrapped in delectable prose. So many contemporary novels lack thorough editing - even well written books tend to offer interludes of decent writing spoiled by intermittent wastelands of verbosity.- Exquisite language - it deserves to be said twice!"
1692,Sierra,"Oh, Daisy. Your way of speaking and moving unfortunately charmed one too many people, and you didn't even have the decency to attend one of said victims' funerals. Shame on you, darling.There isn't much I can say besides how upset it makes me that Daisy was unintentionally, the biggest bitch ever and also, how Gatsby suffered because of it. What also makes me upset is thinking back on how long it took me to crack this open. Perhaps I should take more trips to BC, in order to read more classics (like Anna Karenina and Pride & Prejudice). Or maybe I could just start picking up a book every time I reach for my Xbox remote..On another note: while in BC, I decided to go see the movie and oh my. Without reading the book, I thought: ""Oh, wow. Why an amazing movie."" But after reading the book, I realize that the filmmakers deserved a larger applause than the non-existent one I gave them in my head. Each character portrayed the characters in the novel just wonderfully. The script writers used a lot of dialogue from the book, and that was wonderful. Leo's pronunciation of old sport and frequent action of slicking his hair back was the greatest thing. Again, I am ashamed I hadn't read this before. 5/5 stars, most definitely. On a scale of 1-70, this book was definitely a 70. (And where I begin bringing in inside jokes between my friends and I, is where I finish the review.)"
1693,Linda,"While browsing through the public library this past fall, I happened to spot The Great Gatsby on the shelf and picked it up on a whim. I first read The Great Gatsby in 10th grade English class, and now, suspecting it may have gone completely over my head, it occurred to me there was something to be gained from rereading it as a grownup. Wow. Talk about an understatement. In short, I came to the conclusion that books such as Gatsby are not merely wasted on teenagers, but in fact ought to be preemptively kept out of the hands of highschoolers. Because what happens? After 10th grade English, you tell yourself you've read it, and you're rarely tempted to go back and read it again, and so you effectively miss out on one of the unquestionable greats of American literature. Everything I missed as a teenager (how could I have failed to note such a gorgeous line as ""her voice was full of money""?) seems unforgettable to me now. The Great Gatsby has most assuredly earned its place in the American literature canon, for its snapshot of the Jazz Age twenties in full, exuberant swing; for its unsentimental look at the self-consciousness, optimism, and disillusion embedded in the ""American Dream""; and for Fitzgerald's ability to capture moments and people in descriptions that are simultaneously poetic and meticulous.One of the first things that struck me as I began (re)reading was the realization that when I came to this as for the first time as a 10th grader, I had absolutely no sense of the significance of the time in which the story takes place. It meant nothing to me beyond the fact that the action in the book took place A Long Long Time Ago. Now, especially at a time when Boardwalk Empire has opened up America's collective cultural awareness of what the 20s was -- prohibition, bootlegging, gangsters, social revolution, labor organizing, liberation for women on a previously unknown scale, post-Great-War euphoria and loss of innocence (yet still with blissful unawareness that a second Great War was coming) -- it is impossible not to see the story as emblematic of its time.How could a young person such as I was fully appreciate what this era was like -- an era when almost overnight America catapulted into the new, liberating, dizzyingly technological age? Actually, the phrase ""like someone hitting a light switch for the first time"" is almost literally applicable here. It bears remembering that at this time the Luna Park amusement park at Coney Island was a wonderland as much for its being bathed in electric lights as for its entertainment attractions. Just take in these lines from the New York Times' May 17, 1903 article on Luna Park's opening night:About 45,000 men, women, and children strolling along Surf Avenue, at Coney Island, from 8 o'clock last night until 1 o'clock this morning stopped at one point along this varied thoroughfare and rubbed their eyes and stood in wonder and pinched themselves to see if there was not something wrong somewhere. The Coney Island visitor does not expect much variety in the attractions gathered at the great breathing space by the sea, but here was a strange sight for Coney Island. Yawning on the dingy old pleasure thoroughfare was a monster arch, covering half a city block. The interior of this arch was a solid mass of electric lights and rising many feet into the air were four monster monoliths, traced in electric lights and surmounted by great balls of fire, which shed light over the island. . . .They [the park's creators] have created a realm of fairy romance in colored light, so beautiful that the rest of Coney Island will have to clean up and dress up, if it is to do business. there are no frankfurters to be found sizzling in Luna Park, but there is pretty nearly everything else that was ever seen in Coney Island and many things new. But the beauty of the place under its extraordinary electrical illumination scheme is its primary feature. When at 8 o'clock promptly last night the 122,000 electric lights had been flashed into brilliancy, and the crowd began pouring in, the visitors passed under the great arch and down a broad avenue called the Court of Honor. On the right of this avenue was a Venetian city, with its columns and colonnades and minarets, and in front of this city a grand canal bridged and illuminated. . . .If it's starting to sound like a description of the Las Vegas strip today, only imagine what it must have looked like to people seeing electric light for the first time. It is no mistake that Nick sees Gatsby's West Egg mansion, lit up for its hundreds of guests deep into the night, as a ""carnival."" This new era of electricity and technology is not just an arbitrary setting for the human story - it is its warp and weft. Think also of the roles played by automobiles in the narrative. Key characters are matched by their distinctive motorcars: Nick drives a beat up Dodge; Gatsby has an extravagant sports car. Much of the action of the book, from the general lifestyle depicted in the novel to, most critically, Myrtle's secret life and her tragedy, is framed by the high-speed whisking-back-and-forth between NY and Long Island that rich men's automobiles make possible.Fitzgerald's descriptive flair makes passage after passage nothing less than a delight to read. I'll not soon forget the image of the breezy summer room at the moment that Nick first encounters Daisy and Jordan. Everything is white and gossamer and billowy, including the ""enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon."" Nor the image of the change that comes over the scene with the ""boom"" that sounds when unexpectedly ""Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor."" (p. 12)That image of that room -- its magical quality as the sun and the breeze play with the light and the fixtures and every person in it, and then the sudden change in the room when the French doors are abruptly shut, bringing everything quite literally back down to earth -- could be a metaphor for the entire central story. People are buoyed up and carried along by a beautiful illusion that they are simultaneously unaware of and yet nurse carefully along, until the jolt of unpleasant reality when their fantasy is revealed for what it is. This is clearly and most obviously the condition of Jay Gatsby and his long-cherished illusion of Daisy, but it can also be seen in Myrtle Wilson and Tom Buchanan's relationship, and in Nick's own initially romantic engagement with this ""East Coast"" life, and his later disenchantment when it is brought down to sordid reality by the unfolding of events in the lives around him.Nowhere is this more poignantly expressed then when Nick describes the green light at the end of the Buchanans' dock, which Gatsby has spent long evenings gazing away at. After meeting Daisy in person, Gatsby remarks on the green light, and Nick observes, ""Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that has separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one"". (p. 98) It seems such a little thing: to lose just one ""enchanted object"" seems a trifling price to pay for having the real object of one's desire literally in one's arms, and yet that sentence, that notion of an enchanted object turned into nothing more than a utilitarian light bulb, is just achingly sad. This sadness is inevitable in a story that is all about nostalgia, especially in the sense of wishing and longing for a past that one never really had. Gatsby dreamed of a thing he had never really possessed: an assured future with the woman he madly loved. Fitzgerald seems to posit that nostalgia as the heart of the human condition, and it is also the heart of our tragedy if we are unable to overcome it: ""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."" (final line, p. 189)The Great Gatsby is an essentially American story, too, in its exploration of this congenital dream that something bigger, something better, can be achieved, that it may be just beyond our grasp, but with the right combination of industriousness, chutzpah, and unadulterated optimism, we can indeed reach it. Nick observes, in his last moments as a West Egger: ""And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors' eyes--a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder."" (p. 189)As a cynical 21st-century reader, I can't help find that last line a little grating. The very notion of this continent of ""America"" as the last thing in all of history commensurate with the human capacity for wonder -- well, if that's not the most compact statement of American exceptionalism I've ever heard, then I don't know what is. But at the same time, Fitzgerald may have been ahead of his time in spotting the dark underside of American exceptionalism. In the book's final paragraphs, Fitzgerald writes: ""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made . . ."" (p 187-188)Nick's parting description of Tom and Daisy Buchanan could just as easily be a modern critique of US foreign policy for the last hundred years or so.Before closing, as much as I've raved about the book, I cannot leave off without raising a few criticisms, as there are also things that annoy me about it. The constantly-referenced tension between East America and West America, this undercurrent of some wholesome, fair, genuine America located somewhere amorphously ""out West"", versus the bewitching, debauched, and unauthentic East Coast America, is as irritating as it is resistant to time. Also, women in general are pretty hard done by in this book. Myrtle is by turns a pathetic and repulsive character; Daisy is superficial at best, underhanded and manipulative at worst; and even Jordan does little more than serve as set dressing to accessorize a scene. But these are quibbles. In 10th grade English class, I was told that The Great Gatsby was a masterpiece. Now, as an adult, I actually know it. "
1694,Jillian Hergenrother,"Jillian HergenrotherEnglish 232Section B1 The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a fiction novel about the summer character Nick Carraway spent in New York with neighbor Jay Gatsby, his cousin Daisy and her husband Tom, as well as other characters who add depth to the novel. Fitzgerald tells an emotional story about love and the want to re-create the past. The author’s purpose of writing this novel was to entertain the audience. Fitzgerald grabs the reader’s attention with a tragic love story and shallow, careless characters, with a few who actually have substance. The author also entertains by making fun of the upper class style of life. Near the end of the novel, the narrator Nick says “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy-­ they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money of their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together and let other people clean up the mess they had made (Fitzgerald, 179).” This is the author making fun of the upper class by showing how they did not understand that actions had consequences and thinking that money would fix everything. Fitzgerald also states through Daisy “I did love him once-- but I loved you too (Fitzgerald, 132).” This is when Gatsby finally sees that even though Daisy did and still loves him, she also loved Tom for a short while, and that he can’t have the thing that he wants: to repeat the past from whenever Daisy loved him only and deeply. It is tragic for the characters and the reader because they see that Gatsby will not get the love that he has done everything for. Even though his hopes were a little outrageous and a tad delusional, it creates such an entertaining climax that makes the reader love the bitter sweetness of the book even more. A common theme in the novel is love and wealth are synonymous. Even though Gatsby loves Daisy, it is also hinted that he loved her high class lifestyle and richness just as much. She represented everything he wanted to be when he first met her. Gatsby buys extravagant things and lives a life full of wealth just to make Daisy love him. He believes, and is most likely right, that she will only love him if he has a copious amount of money and items. Whenever he takes Daisy into his house for the first time, Nick says ‘He hadn’t once eased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes (Fitzgerald, 91).” This shows how he only likes what she thinks is valuable and beautiful enough. The things he loves come from the materialistic-ness of Daisy. Gatsby even stopped throwing lavish parties at his house once he saw how much Daisy disliked them. He does not show her love in meaningful ways, he shows her love by using his wealth for her.  The style of this novel was a first person narration. Nick Carraway, the narrator, tells the events of the previous summer through the things he experienced first had as well as telling stories about other people. Nick says in the book “After Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes’ power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on he like I decided to come back home (Fitzgerald, 176).” This shows how it is first person and him telling the events of what he did in the order they happened. This style is effective because it allows the reader to experience the events first hand, but also have the insight of Nick looking back on the situation. It helps the reader understand more about what was going on than if the novel was set as third person during the actual time of the events.  I thought that the novel, The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, was written eloquently with characters the reader loves to hate, hate to love, or just love to love. Fitzgerald’s story is funny (mostly because we can see him making fun of the Americans), agonizing (in relation to the love story), and purely wonderful. I thought that Daisy could have been more assertive and decisive, but I think that the time period prevents those characteristics some and that the author purposefully made her that way. This novel has made my top five of my favorite books which also includes one of my other favorite classics, Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, which also has an unfortunate love story. The endings of the two are much different though, because Pride and Prejudice ends happily, but The Great Gatsby ends tragically. I think that this novel is well deserving of any award or praise that it receives."
1695,Estefanía Sol,"Short. Nice. Entertaining. Very well written. Gatsby is an amazing character. The colour of his house, his parties and his acquaintances contrast with the hollowness of his relationships, his own story and his purpose."
1696,Ramona,"Has there ever been a better closing line than, ""And so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly in time""? I think not."
1697,Studmuffin,"This book takes place in the 1920's and is narrated by nick caraway, a former writer. Nick moves into a small house in long island, little did he know his neighbor was a very interesting man. People called this man Gatsby, every night he threw big parties at his mansion. Almost everyone in New York attended them, but nobody had ever actually seen Gatsby. Until young Nick Caraway was invited, Nick came to one of the wild parties but seem to be the only one who had actually received an invitation. Nick finally met Gatsby and they became quick friends, Gatsby invited Nick out to do things with him. Nick soon found out that one of his close friends tom who was enrolled at Yale with Nick had been married to a girl named Daisy. Gatsby told nick that him and Daisy were in love before he had to go off to war, Gatsby wanted to see Daisy again. Nick goes against his instinct and invites Daisy over for tea (Gatsby's orders) so they could meet again. After seeing Gatsby again Daisy started spending allot of time with him, secretly hiding this from tom who was also very rich. The two of them compete for Daisy's love after Gatsby convinces Daisy to tell Tom about them. This story was a great book about the short life of J. Gatsby."
1698,Max,"Yes, I really did make it through 23 years of my life without ever having to read The Great Gatsby. And then I decided entirely on my own—alright, there was some jeering from one of my professors who was in disbelief that I hadn't read it yet—that, as a writer myself, I needed to read what is considered by many as the great American novel.It's a beautiful book. Fitzgerald uses dialogue well (which is surprising as most of us are taught to steer away from too much of it, yet here most of the book is comprised of it), and the moments where he veers away from that narrative are just really well crafted. He has the perfect balance of exposition and description, and it never gets too flowery or over-the-top. There are paragraphs where I had to just sit, jaw dropped, and appreciate the way he manipulated the words and formed his sentences. The characters are deep and flawed, though he lets the reader realize that on their own rather than having it forced on them. Overall, I can understand why this book continues to be taught and why it is so important that everyone read it."
1699,Shahine Ardeshir,"This book is proof that good things can often come in small, unassuming packages. The movie may have been extravagant, but the novel certainly isn't. Compared to a lot of fiction written today, The Great Gatsby is a short book about a seemingly innocuous social scene in New York in the 1920s. But the genius of Fitzgerald is how much he packs into these few pages. Layered characters, unique and yet recognizably human, mixed in with a story that kept me wondering till the very last page, the book was dazzling and so humane at the same time.At the heart of it all is Gatsby, who appears on less pages than I would have imagined, but still has you thinking about him all through. He's both the hero and villion of his world, and as a reader I envied, pitied, loved and hated him.There's a reason they call this book a classic. It'll be ten times better than anything else you've read recently. Read it now."
1700,Mary,This book was so much better than the recent film of it.Then I always prefer the book.
1701,Chunyang Ding,"Good book, at least on the first read through. Certain that after the 23rd time, it'll become more passive in my mind. However, clearly a great American Novel that showcases the glamor and illusions of the 1920's!"
1702,Mac,"This was second or third on the Modern Library's big list, and at the time I didn't get it. Read it again last year and said: ""Oh."""
1703,Mae,"For now I'm leaving this review incomplete.What others think:The greatest American book of all time. Touches deeper into the American Dream. Nicholas Spark's The Notebook is a rip-off of Gatsby - I agree, and I have been a Spark's fan. The movie song, ""Love is Blindness"" is Gatsby in hell. Summer romances should STAY summer romances. Learn from Gatsby: Don't come home for love. Nick might be gay in the homosexual sense (if you look for that it's pretty amusing). Owl eyes is God looking down on the Ashen Valley. The songs are important as well as the other allusions like the book where Gatsby's daily schedule was written in. ""The rich get richer the poor get - children."" Yet why doesn't Myrtle (""the weed"" in this context) have children? Who has a child? Ah yes... Daisy. The one that always wears white dresses, but like her name, there is a yellow core. She isn't pure. East Egg and West Egg connect to the bible - Adam and Eve are banished to the West. According to my friend's project on the book, the East are the Old Money snobs who look down on the West that include the New Money rich folk. Very romantic.What I think (mosaic of thoughts):Nothing like I expected. Poetic. I enjoyed it. Structure is complicated because it's Nick two years after that recounts that summer romance and trying to make sense of it. Memories are deceiving as they tend to be biased.In the beginning Nick goes to see his distant cousin Daisy and her husband Tom. His motive is unclear, as he does not reveal it. But, as we find out Tom is a pretty rotten character, we also find out he's richer than most men. It's clear that Nick, who also moved out of his family's home to work in the bond business, is seeking money from Tom. Nick is building connections, and he uses Daisy who is related to him as an excuse to meet with them. This is crucial to know, as there are too many acts of self-interest going on in the novel. Like, Gatsby using Nick as a tool to get Daisy... and Nick is only offended by the way Gatsby goes about the bush (painfully obvious). Gatsby is only surrounded by people due to his wealth. Oddly enough, Daisy can't stand that, but tolerates it, too. Just like Nick and Gatsby. A lot of societal inappropriate gestures and events takes place (like in Pride and Prejudice there is folly). Hmmm... I find it interesting no one crashes Gatsby's funeral like they do to his parties. They need him alive, not dead. Well said. I enjoyed making sense of this book.The one original idea I ever came up with in regards to this novel that I really like:The part in Chapter V where Gatsby is throwing the colorful shirts is really Gatsby showering Daisy with confetti to celebrate her return to his side. This impressed the class and my teacher; he related the idea of rose petals onto beds, which is an act to bless fertility (just like when Tom gave Daisy a pearl necklace on the day of the wedding... and pearl necklaces are traditionally given by mother-in-laws to bless their daughter-in-law's fertility)."
1704,Melissa Darnold,"You know those books that you've read so many times that you can just drop it on any surface and it'll flump down onto a section that's been read over and over again? The kind of book that looks abused in appearance, but really just means it's beloved? That's Gatsby for me. I honestly can't say why I feel this way about the book. I don't like Gatsby, I don't like Daisy, I don't like Tom; even Nick is somewhat obtuse and is unlikeable. But, I love the book regardless. It's one of my all-time favorites.Perhaps F. Scott Fitzgerald meant to write truly unlikeable characters. Ironically, the most vapid character--Jordan Baker--is my favorite. She's brutally honest and doesn't hold anything back. It's refreshing in a sea of lies and ingenuity. But, maybe that was his [the author's] point: to write these characters to be unlikeable; to be untruthful, and selfish, and unkind. Maybe his point wasn't to care for Gatsby, though I find myself torn in that area. Each time I reread the book, I feel differently for Mr. Gatsby. Do I like him this time or do I not like him? Or, rather, am I sympathetic to his plight. It's a toss-up.What I love most about this book is its timelessness. It cannot be captured properly by any motion picture or play. It just is. F. Scott Fitzgerald did not know of the valor the novel would receive; he died before finding out. If only he could see just how much Gatsby has influenced those of us and the world in general. With the setting in the Roaring Twenties, the characters vapid and fake, and the secrets kept about the man in question; the reader is left to wonder just what it is about Daisy and the green light across the way and just how far you'll go for love."
1705,Eva,One of the truly most significant books I have ever read. Insightful in showing both the importance and the simplicity of human nature. Noone can escape from their own personal demons whether this means death or ignorance.
1706,Brian Lutz,"Reminds me of Remains of the Day. Not everyone is born into success. Some achieve it anyway. To focus on the past is to remove oneself from the future; even the present becomes unobtainable.What will people think of me after I die? Who will show up at my funeral? Will my friends be there? In the end, it really doesn't matter. A man or woman can have all the casual acquaintances in the world, but the only people who truly show up are those who's life you've made a positive impact in. People gossip about, lie to, cheat, steal from, and do business with you. This doesn't make them love you. So instead of creating a fantastic life focused on loose relationship (sometimes necessary on the path to success) instead focus on making a difference in one person's life. Gatsby chooses someone; even in death his father cannot help to remark how proud of his son he is. Instead of pursuing every floosy lover on the block, invest your time into someone special. Even if it doesn't pan out, FOCUS. the long-term benefits of such determination and grit pay out the short-term pain one must suffer. We all face hardships in life. We all make mistakes. The correct way to deal with these hardships is not to fret; not to accept defeats; not to become complacent and comfortable. The correct path is to continually challenge oneself for the betterment not of oneself, but for society as a whole. Gatsby spent the last years of his life living for other people. Only upon realizing the true path to happiness (through himself rather than others) did he obtain the peace which he always wanted. I think that is a powerful message not to be confused or belittled. I have since revised my review on The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway; The Great Gatsby simply stands on its own in terms of late-gilded age/post-world war fiction. "
1707,Aalayna,"You know that book that you're forced to read in school and you only hate the book because someone forced you to read it but after you read it in school you become obsessed with the story? Well, The Great Gatsby is that book. After reading TGG for the second (then third, then fourth...) time I began to comprehend the beauty behind Fitzgerald's words and it is easily one of my favorites. The poisonously gorgeous Daisy's past flame with the silently extravagant Jay Gatsby is only the start of this twisted 'love' story. I highly recommend The Great Gatsby to anyone who wants to see the hazardous mess love can be and how is not always infinitely secure."
1708,wenshuren,"Before I read this book, I thought this book was about some psycho named Gatsby, but I was completely wrong.....I wanted to rate this book 4 stars initially due to the tragic end of main character, Gatsby, but how could I deny what Fitzgerald truely deserved?The followings are the Reader's Guide discussion questions from National Endowment for The Arts and my attempt to answer the questions.1) The novel's action occurs in 1922 between June and September. How does Nick's nonchronological narration shape your response to the events surrounding the mystery of Jay Gatsby? I was lost for the first 50 pages of so......2) Nick believes he is an honest, nonjudgemental narrator. Do you agree?I would agree with him as I read the whole thing through his eyes3) Gatsby believes that the past can be repeated. Is he right?  He is a King of Wishful Thinking4) Why does Daisy sob into the ""thick folds"" of Gatsby's beautiful shirts?  She is constantly looking for something/someone better?5) What do the faded eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg symbolize? Is there a connection between this billboard and the green light at the end of Daisy's dock? Maybe someone else can answer this because I really don't know.....6) Perhaps the novel's climax occurs when Gatsby confronts Tom in New York. Did Daisy's ultimate choice surprise you? Is it consistent with her character?  Daisy is just an ordinary girl, not guts and she has made a decision in line with her character7) Do you agree with Nick's final assertion that Gatsby is ""worth the whole damn bunch put together""? Why or why not?  He has always knew what he is after and he works for it. Others are just using him to party8) How does Fitzgerald foreshadow the tragedies at the end?  The yellow car and when Gatsby gave instruction not to clean the swimming pool9) Does the novel critique or uphold the values of the Jazz Age and the fears of the Lost Generation?  I think so because I could picture it in my head10) Fitzgerald wrote, ""You don't write because you want to say something, you write because you have something to say."" What did he have to say in Gatsby?  His silly believe in the thing called love11) Fitzgerald scholar Matthew J. Bruccoli claims: ""The Great Gatsby does not proclaim the nobility of the human spirit; it is not politically correct; it does not reveal how to solve the problems of life; it delivers no fashionable or comforting messages. It is just a masterpiece."" Do you agree?  Yes, hands down"
1709,Julius," Jay Gatsby had lost his greatness after he died. The people who were always there at his party were absent both on his wake and funeral except for his onlytrue friend and companions - Nick Carraway, old man on Gatby's library, and his servants. Daisy, his love interest, who should have been there at his death, had forsaken himto run away from a tragedy that was really her fault.  What sparked my interest to read this novel is because I find its movie adaptation ( I watched the movie first ) appealing with its classic American splendor, vanity, and story. I wanted to find more details by reading the novel why Daisy had easily left Gatsby.  Francis Fitzgerald, the author had written the novel with clear details. There were some terms I really didnt understand at first read (words referring to architectural terms, or objectsknown at that American time) that i need to look on the ereader dictionary. I also like how he had made Nick Carraway the narrator of the story. That green light that adds more mysteryin the novel was a good catch to any readers. No doubt this novel is truly listed itself as one of the greatest novels ever written."
1710,Julie Wilding,"""Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape..""""His wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible.""""Her laughter, her gestures, her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.""""It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to face--the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor.""""I like large parties. They're so intimate. At small parties there isn't any privacy.""""The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly, that everything was very, very sad--she was not only singing, she was weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano.""""No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.""""She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand.""""'Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?' There was a husky tenderness in his tone . . . 'Daisy?'""""But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.""""And all the time something within her was crying out for a decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately--and the decision must be made by some force--of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality--that was close at hand.""""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."""
1711,Andrea Guerra,"Me gustó leer un clásico después de tanto tiempo. Para ser un clásico fue bastante ligero y fácil de seguir. Por el títulos del libro podía jurar que sabía quien era el narrador, me sorprendió bastante encontrarme sin saber quién hablaba siquiera, fue una jugada muy interesante de parte del escritor. El final me gustó bastante, justamente así debió terminar todo, otro final no hubiese sido impactante y el libro sería poco memorable, claro, según me parece."
1712,Tati Dengo,"Have heard so many differing opinions of this book, but no one ever mentioned how poetically beautiful its language is. Fitzgerald's writing has an ephemeral, dreamy quality that reminded me of Philip K. Dick's (minus the pessimistic darkness), and with a charm that I can only describe as glittering. "
1713,Chris Lopez," It took me until the last three chapters of this book to begin to really get into it. The first half was pretty boring to me and just seemed like any old book. The Great Gatsby soon changed my opinion. Not only was this book appealing to emotion, it also had many themes and morals that the reader can learn. There are internal conflicts mixed with external conflicts and the whole book is just good reading. What I liked most however, was the way Fitzgerald was able to use each characters personality to mold the story.  This book depicts the exciting tale of love, adultery, dishonesty, and even murder. It takes place during a time period known as the roaring twentys and uses enough historical context to let the reader know what life was like back then. The World Series had just been fixed. The Great war was over. Money was no issue for some of the main characters. Nick was an average man who had a rich friend and was cousins with this mans wife. He lived next door to the rich eccentric Gatsby. While getting to learn Gatsby, he learns that his rich arrogant entitled friend Tom has a mistress that his cousin Daisy knows about. In the end, you find out that Gatsby and Daisy used to be in love and now he is trying to get her back but she is unsure because of all of the trouble it is causing. In her angry confused state, she ends up hitting and killing Tom's mistress by mistake and kills her. Gatsby is blamed because it was his car so Wilson, the husband of the newly deceased, kills Gatsby and then himself. Daisy and Tom leave never to be heard of again.  Throughout the book, some morals that come up are dishonesty, materialism, adultery, and murder. For each moral, the characters involved make a bad choice and things get even worse for them. Nick ends up having to set up Gatsby's funeral and all of that stuff by himself because people only liked Gatsby for his money and pretty much bailed on him except for his dad. The book is sad and also makes you angry as you read more and more but while you are reading, you never want to put it down either once it gets started. I would recommend this book to high school students and above because while it is a great book, I think anyone younger would find it slow and boring and a little confusing because of how Fitzgerald."
1714,Dilan,"Muhteşem Gatsby.Daha önceleri filmini izlemedim diye kendime kızdığım oldu ama şimdi kendime dedim ki ""İyiki izlememişsin."" Neden böyle dedim? Çünkü filme dönüşen romanlarda her zaman sihirli bölümler kesilir ve filmi izledikten sonra okursanız karakterlerin bir büyüsü kalmaz.O yüzden bu kitabın sihrini koruduğu gerçeği beni mutlu ediyor.Gelelim kitabın özelliklerine.Başlarda biraz sıkıldım ve olaylar arasında bağlantı kurmakta ciddi anlamda güçlük yaşadım.Sonra her şey yavaş yavaş yerine oturdu.Fakat ben hala Gatsby'nin partisine gelenlerin isimlerinin detaylı bir şekilde yazılmasına tepkiliyim.Yazarlar böyle detaylarla gerçekçi bir hikaye oluşturacaklarını sanıyorlar.Öyle olmuyor tabi.Bazı bölümlere aşırı ayrıntı yüklerseniz okur olaydan kopuyor.En azından bir bölümde yapılan bu hata diğer bölümlerde konu bütünlüğüyle telafi edilmişti.Sonlara doğru da duygu yoğunluğundan nasıl bir tepki vereceğimi şaşırmıştım.Gatsby,gördüğüm en mükemmel karakterlerden biri olurken Daisy de aynı oranda yerin dibine girdi.Bir kadının bir adamın aşkına Daisy tarzı karşılık vermesi düşüncesi beni sinirlendirdi.Fakat karakterler ustaca hazırlanmıştı ve nefret etsem bile Daisy'nin kişiliği de beni etkiledi.Kısaca hayat hakkında Gatsby'den öğrenecek çok şeyim varmış.Ben öğreneceğimi öğrendim ve okumayan herkese öneriyorum!"
1715,Cindy,"Hot summer nights, mid JulyWhen you and I were forever wildThe crazy days, city lightsThe way you'd play with me like a childWill you still love meWhen I'm no longer young and beautiful?Will you still love meWhen I got nothing but my aching soul?I know you will, I know you willI know that you willWill you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?- Young and Beautiful by Lana del Ray WOAAAAA !! I LOVE AND HATE THIS BOOK AT THE SAME TIME!!""You can’t change the past–but you can change yourself""The Great Gatsby is breathtaking.I don’t know, it speaks of something more about humans. It speaks of our ugly sides. Selfishness. Greediness. Of people who are loyal and believe in love. F. Scott Fitzgerald taught me that life’s more complicated than it looks.Honestly, I hate Daisy more than I hate Tom itself, the fucking bastard who constanly cheating on her....And Gatsby ,,, 
He had one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced, or seemed to face, the whole external world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself.
 He is beyond amazing ...My heart silently weeps for him ... Gatsby doesn’t get Daisy, the girl he’s spent all his life and money trying to impress...I personally thought Gatsby deserved better than Daisy (Nuff said!!) "
1716,Gabriel Garcia,"This book was very intriguing to me, leaving me to keep on reading to solve the mysteries of Gatsby's, and Daisy's long history fulfilled with romance and heartbreak. The book was even better from Nick Carraway's perspective, revealing his feelings, and insight of everything going on from whether it is old friend Tom's affairs or the curiosities of Gatsby mind. The story just leads you up to a point of suspense wondering if Daisy will stay with her cheating husband Tom, or carry on her, and Gatsby's long history of love. Then after all the rising action of the book the story just falls, when Daisy just acts like Gatsby was never in existence after Gatsby got murdered. The story just ended out of nowhere leaving people confused. The book was exceptional at raising your hopes, then dropping them to a point of shock, and disappoint. The book was very splendid ,however it didn't involve an ending that would stand out forever in history, but instead wanting people to just forget the whole story of love, excitement, and grandness."
1717,Hannah S.,"The “American Dream” means something different to every person, but most people can agree that the common denominator is success. Whether this success is earned through hard work and determination or underhanded business is in the power of each man. F. Scott Fitzgerald in The Great Gatsby illuminates the power of wealth and greed and the loss of responsibility that many feel due to their entitlement. Although money can buy many things, the characters in The Great Gatsby don't realize that what they really desire is something they can't purchase. Jay Gatsby, a mid-thirties aged man who lives an extravagant life in his large West Egg house dreams of reliving the past with the person who is still the woman of his dreams, Daisy Fay. After coming back from the military, Gatsby buys a house across the water from Daisy and her new husband, Tom Buchanan. Her house is marked with a green light representing Gatsby’s goal: to have her heart once again. With the help of his newly befriended neighbor Nick Carraway, Gatsby organizes a tea with Daisy, who happens to be cousins with Nick. The get together causes strong feelings to resurface between the two, but after months of sneaking around, the two are forever separated after Gatsby is murdered by the husband of Tom’s mistress, Mr. Wilson. Gatsby was stuck in the past, and day after day he would look at the green light on Daisy’s dock imagining what could be, but reality held him back, “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past” (180). Fitzgerald paints a picture of a boat attempting to cross the Sound to reach the green light, but being restricted by the water’s current. As an adult Gatsby still dreams like a child, and no one attempts to tell him not all dreams are attainable. He can’t stop thinking about the past, yet Tom and Daisy are all for escaping it. Before learning about Gatsby’s death Tom and Daisy leave town leaving Nick with to think, “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy––they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made...” (179). Tom and Daisy left like a tornado, hurting people in their tracks only to escape to a life where all was still okay. Had it not been for their wealth they would have had to stay in town and deal with the destruction that they had caused. It was their prerogative to be irresponsible if it meant they didn't have to deal with a disaster, and after all this may have been in their vision of their own American Dream. Their lives were absorbed into the image of life rather than truly living it. Just as Gatsby thought he was in love with Daisy he eventually realized it was the idea she brought forth rather than who she really was. "
1718,Shannon (Giraffe Days),"It's 1922 and Nick Carraway is moving from Chicago to the East Coast and a new job in New York City in the ""bond business"". He finds a house to rent on Long Island Sound, on the less fashionable West Egg; his second cousin once removed, Daisy Buchanan, lives on the East Egg with her filthy rich husband, the chauvinist and serial philanderer, Tom. Nick goes to visit them and their young houseguest, Jordan Baker, a professional woman golfer, and learns the reason for all the tension in the house: Tom's latest affair is with the wife of a garage mechanic, Myrtle Wilson, who keeps calling the house (so Daisy believes; it is in fact Mr Wilson, who wants to buy one of Tom's cars).Nick's neighbour on the West Egg is Jay Gatsby, who lives in a new, gaudy mansion directly across the sound from Daisy's house. Almost every weekend, hordes of people arrive for the biggest party Nick's ever seen. After a few weeks, Nick receives an invitation to join them, and at Gatsby's house he discovers that almost no one actually knows Jay Gatsby - people just turn up, having heard of it from others. It's rarely the same people each time, even. And people repeat the craziest rumours about Mr Gatsby, such as that he killed a man, and speculate wildly about where his immense wealth comes from (most are sure it's nothing legal). When Nick finally meets the great Gatsby, he isn't sure what to think, but he considers himself a tolerant man and tries to suspend judgement.With Jordan as an intermediary, Nick learns that Gatsby was once a beau of Daisy's before the war, and wants Nick's help in setting up a private meeting where he can see her again. From there, things escalate, someone dies, and the truth about Jay Gatsby changes everything for Nick, who has to decide where his friendship and his loyalties really lie.Earlier this year I mentioned wanting to re-read this before the new Baz Luhrmann movie came out at Christmas 2012; as I write this I learned that it's been pushed back to May 2013. Shame, I'm really looking forward to seeing it and had hoped to over the Christmas holidays, but I can wait. For sure, Luhrmann is the best director for a new adaptation, with his track record of beautiful cinematography, flamboyant set design and knack for capturing the poignant, quiet moments amid the chaos. The excesses of the period, and Jay Gatsby's life in particular, are brought to life in the film very well, judging by the previews.As I said, I had read this before, years ago while at uni (not for a course, just for me). It made no real impression on me, sadly, since I've never been able to remember much about it at all, and a book that forgettable must be, surely, rather lame. (Based on a vague memory of reading it the first time, I wrote this when I added the book to my Goodreads library: ""Read this years ago while at uni and didn't like it, though I remember there being some lovely bits of prose. Still, I want to re-read it, so I finally picked up a copy. We'll see."") Well I have to wonder, now that I've read it about 13 years later, just what was wrong with me. How could I have forgotten all of this? It was like reading it for the first time - which was great, but the thought did nag at me, that I was rather disappointed in myself. My younger self, anyway. It's certainly true that with many books, when (at what stage in your life) you read a book can go a long way to influencing how much you enjoy it.For such a slim novel, there is a lot of interesting stuff crammed in here. My copy was one I'd picked up secondhand, and I hadn't realised when I got it that there were notes and marking throughout, in pencil, from some student - I absolutely hate it when people do that, because their own comments keep intruding and getting in the way. It's like watching a movie at the cinema with someone sitting near you who keeps making comments, interrupting your own enjoyment and your own thoughts. I started rubbing them out after a while, but you can never really get rid of them (I plan on getting a new copy, only there are so many editions available, which one should I get?). The person was clearly focused on writing an essay about class consciousness and the American dream, with notes like this: ""The book is largely about social class and the failure of the American dream"" and ""Myrtle's apt. a parody of Gatsby's house and social class"" and ""Daisy is the embodiment of the American dream for Gatsby."" Which is a perfectly fine argument (remember, the key to studying English is this: you can argue anything you like, as long as you can back it up), but this other person's voice kept interrupting my own train of thought, and the path my own mind was on in its own interpretation. The direction my mind was going, as I read this, was a little beyond classism and the attainment of the American Dream - clearly a theme, but a bit of a cliche - to this main word: Illusion.Throughout the novel, the main theme that encompasses all others is ""illusion"". The illusion of wealth and happiness, the illusion of grandeur, the illusion of happiness, the illusion that Jay Gatsby lives for - and not just him, though his is the one that drives the plot forward. Everyone in this book is suffering from a case of pretending, of putting on an act, of being someone they're not - or maintaining the illusion of what they want people to see. The illusion of Jay Gatsby is the strongest, because he has the farthest to go - from humble origins to the kind of man he thinks Daisy wants, and then around again in a circle to the illusion of Daisy as a young girl, the Daisy he's been chasing after all these years. As I went over to say good-bye I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby's face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams - not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusions. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart. [pp.92-3]Jay Gatsby isn't even Jay Gatsby, and his wealth isn't the old money of those from the East Egg, but dodgy new money, spent vulgarly in an attempt to raise himself up. From his fake ""old sport"" affectation to his fake Oxford education, the truth about Jay Gatsby is something only Nick Carraway learns about - everyone else sees an illusion, either the one Gatsby wanted them to see or one they've created themselves. (It reminds me of the double illusion of Victor Victoria, in which Julie Andrews pretends to be a man pretending to be a woman, called Count Victor, and it works because everyone thinks he's a fake - as in, not a real count. No one ever realises that he is really a she, because they're too busy looking at the illusion in the magician's right hand, to see the one in his left. Love that movie, by the way.) I suppose he'd had the name ready for a long time, even then [at age seventeen]. His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people - his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself. He was a son of God - a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that - and he must be about His Father's business, the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty. So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end. [p.95]It is not just Jay Gatsby and the circle of people Nick Carraway spends so much time with during this period, but pretty much everyone else Nick encounters. It speaks to a bigger illusion: the illusion of the American Dream - something you can say easily in this day and age, with hindsight and presentism, but that doesn't undermine its illusory quality. Everyone was chasing something, and America was one of those places where it all seemed obtainable - and where the success stories, like Gatsby's, only seemed to reinforce the illusion.Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after seven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people I didn't know - though here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry, and all talking in low, ernest voices to solid and prosperous Americans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or insurance or automobiles. They were at least agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key. [p.43]The theme of illusion is strong with the Buchanan's and their friend Jordan Baker; Jordan maintains the illusion of the quintessential 20s socialite and professional woman, who drives badly and dangerously (the illusion of immortality) and who cheats at golf - because the illusion of success is more important than sportsmanship or honour. The more Nick comes to know these people, the less he likes them, until at the end when they fail at the most basic level of human decency (attending a funeral for someone they knew), he gives up on them completely. The sense that everything is fake is tangible, and makes everything sour in Nick's mouth. At the end, the only person he still feels respect for is Gatsby - though the cynical part of me wonders if that would have soured too, if he'd known him longer or under different circumstances.As a final nod to the theme I'm going with here of illusion, is this scene between Gatsby and Nick:He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say: 'I never loved you.' After she had obliterated four years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her house - just as if it were five years ago.'And she doesn't understand,' he said. 'She used to be able to understand. We'd sit for hours--'He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favors and crushed flowers.'I wouldn't ask too much of her,' I ventured. 'You can't repeat the past.''Can't repeat the past?' he cried incredulously. 'Why of course you can!'He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.'I'm going to fix everything just the way it was before,' he said, nodding determinedly. 'She'll see.'He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was ... [pp.105-6](Don't you just love that parallel between Gatsby's feelings and the ""desolate path of ... discarded favors and crushed flowers""?)One of the exceptional things about this novel is the sense of atmosphere, time and place that Fitzgerald evokes, and captures in fine detail. Throughout the story, there's this neat balance between realism and embellishment for the sake of literary drama, and the realism in particular seems so effortless, so natural and present, that while you're reading it you can, sometimes, forget you're not living in the 1920s yourself. I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others - poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner - young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life. [p.57]It was perhaps Nick's affinity with the loneliness that goes hand-in-hand with the new growth of big cities and anonymous desk jobs, that gave him the empathy - or at least the sympathy - towards Jay Gatsby. While at the very beginning of the novel, Nick refers to himself as a tolerant person, he is of course just as judgemental as everyone else. And it was hard to keep up with who he liked or disliked - after the car accident, when Gatsby cares only for Daisy, Nick seems to feel only contempt for him. How or why it changed, I didn't quite grasp - perhaps on another re-read that would become clear.There is so much to discuss with this novel. Unlike my experience reading his unfinished 
The Love of the Last Tycoon
, or even his exceptional but depressing 
Tender is the Night
, I had a thoroughly positive experience reading The Great Gatsby, from my enjoyment of the overall plot and characters, to the quite wonderful prose and the deeper themes inherent in the story. Fitzgerald's success lies primarily with keeping this book so much shorter than his others - I may have enjoyed Tender... more if it had been this short and concise. There's no waffling or flowery descriptions; everything seems precisely written, for a purpose. I don't expect great things from novels that are lauded as landmark fiction, classics that are much beloved: I don't like a book just because everyone else does. I make a book work for me. And I like a book that makes me work just as hard, if not harder. The Great Gatsby is one of those rare books that is deceptively simple, telling a surprisingly plain story that - not disguises, but reveals, a great deal about a culture and a psyche and a way of life. Fitzgerald shows just how much you can achieve when you keep things short and simple, and how great talent can hide within plain writing.

1719,Davide Genco,"Mi sono ripromesso di scrivere una recensione per ognuno dei libri che leggo. In questo caso specifico sono un po' intimidito dalla caratura del classico che ho avuto fra le mani, ma provo umilmente a esporre le mie sensazioni sul racconto, conscio che molti avran già detto tutto quello che c'era da dire.La cosa che ho adorato di più dell'autore é questa abilità nell'incastonare lucide riflessioni esistenziali all'interno di un tessuto narrativo di una semplicità evidentemente funzionale. É incredibile con quanta efficacia una ponderata sequenza di parole riesca a illustrare vividamente gli umori, i caratteri, le relazioni, le situazioni che hanno luogo nel romanzo e a ricondurre al tempo stesso dei gesti ordinari all'interno di un quadro più ampio in cui prende forma il disegno della nostra umanità. La malinconica metafora che conclude il romanzo ne rappresenta infine la fulgida sintesi emotiva ed esistenziale, e al tempo stesso consegna al racconto una conclusione di rara bellezza."
1720,Emily Eastman,"""I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden, and the cars going up and down his drive"" (Fitzgerald 179.) We embark into the 1920's were a time of smooth jazz, glitzy parties, and a fair share of scandal. What waits for us here? Only pages will tell. I absolutely adored this book. I fell in love with the 1920's! The Great Gatsby is a true classic through it's three-dimensional characters, timeless themes, and astounding plot. First, The Great Gatsby has three dimensional characters. In the opening of the story Mr. Carraway, a fresh new face in business, makes some very wealthy acquantices. They are portrayed as perfect citizens living every man's dream. Slowly though, we as reader's, see through the mirage the author has shown us. People are people and no amount of money can change a person's character nor make them happier. You grow to fall in love with Gatsby. He is a much more devoted and realistic Edward! All you lovestruck teenage girls need to get a picture of him up on your walls. Gatsby never gives up on his long lost love, he sees a future bright with hope, and earns himself fame and fortune just to win over the lass of his dreams. A man with such love and care is unheard of. If I were to bring one male character to life I've convinced myself it'll be him. Then, this book contains timeless themes. : “…they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made....” (Fitzgerald 179.) Mr. Fitzgerald really shows the reader the pitfalls of wealth. Rather then increasing ones love for humankind it often does the opposite, it causes one to become greedy and careless. It really gave me a fresh outlook on the views of soicety. As a people, we glorify men and women with as much abundance in wealth as absense in morals. Young girls cover their walls with these men and women and aspire to be them. We learn in this novel though, money yields no hapiness it is the human bonds made in life that do, so be sure to make the correct ones.Also, this book has an astounding plot. When I scanned over the book for the first time I assumed it would be boring. The summary on the back doesn't do it justice. It is not just another historical fiction! It's so much more. The plot takes a dramatic dive near the end you will never see coming until you're falling with the book. I fell in love with this novel. It has become one of my favorites.Finally, The Great Gatsby is a true classic through it's three-dimensional characters, timeless themes, and astounding plot. This book deserves the titles and recognition it has earned. I eagerly anticipate the realease of the film. I reccommend this book to all those able to read at this level. It isn't a hard read and gets going quickly.*** It's time for... the age appropriateness section! Alright, so the Great Gatsby is a classic and is written, naturally, for an older audience. However, this book though it does have some mature concepts, doesn't dwell on them. Tom (a wealthy aristocrat) in the book has a mistress while married, and his wife (Daisy) remeats an old love and we, as readers, assume they have an affair. Violence-wise, Two people do die in the book. The first death is a bit graphic but nothing like your traditional action blood and guts stuff. Then this book's language was fairly clean, a few swear words here and there, nothing memorable. This book shouldn't be read by preteens, but above that age (if one has the proper reading skill) I'm sure it will be fine!(:"
1721,Scott,motherfuckin god damn
1722,Zaheer Khan,"I read this book after seeing the movie. I really liked the movie so I thought I'd read the book too. The review will contain some spoilers about the story, so beware.This book is all about opposites. Honesty vs dishonesty. Rich vs poor. Modest vs extravagant.The narrator, Nick Carraway, is a very honest man. At some point he says he is one of the few honest men he knows. Pretty much everyone else in the book is dishonest. Gatsby has a (partially) fake background story. Tom was cheating on his wife. Daisy was leaning towards disloyalty to her husband at one point. Most of the time the characters were blind to all the lying and cheating that was going on. I think this is a warning to the reader to not be like them. Don't be a dishonest person and in addition to that don't be naive and assume people are being honest all the time.Another contrast is between rich and poor. Daisy and Tom are both from rich families, while Gatsby and Tom are both from poor families. Tom is an elitist, he looks down on everyone, thinks he is superior and thinks he knows best. He also thinks he can do anything and get away with it. Tom and Daisy are also very selfish people. Tom only cares about his own pleasure. Daisy married Tom, while she was in love with Gatsby. Then again she decided not to leave Tom when Gatsby gave her the golden opportunity. Nick and Gatsby on the other hand, come from poor families. Gatsby acquired wealth through shady methods and Nick is still trying to get things going, with honest methods. This also explains why Gatsby eventually does not get accepted by Tom and Daisy, while Nick is being accepted into the 'high society'. What Nick and Gatsby do have in common is their selflessness. Gatsby spends his wealth on big parties and cares more about Daisy than about himself. Nick is also not a very selfish person.Ultimately this book is also about chasing your dreams. Gatsby had a dream. He had his life all mapped out. When things didn't go as planned, he doubled his efforts and tried even harder to get things going. He even explicitly says the past can be undone and the past can be forgotten. Maybe he was a bit too naive, because it turns out that not everyone is willing to do that. What still matters is that he tried. And that's what we should do as well, even if we might fail in the end. We should go and chase our dreams."
1723,Yara Abbo,"Wow, a book for school that I enjoyed. What a miracle!The book took a little bit to get into because Fitzgerald takes a lot of time to describe things, and it feels like it drags (at least it did when I was trying to read 4 chapters at 1 in the morning). But by around chapter 3 I was hooked. It was actually these descriptions in the end that made me love the book so much. His writing is beautiful. His ability to weave words together to create a beautiful image is astounding, and I just devoured some of the passages. I also greatly appreciated the themes in this book (aka the reason we read in school) and how Fitzgerald intertwined the different character's plots and history to create this story that grew in scale the more you learned about each individual character. The book was just great. I definitely recommend it!"
1724,Colleen Andrews,"I first read this book in my early '20s and found it depressing, strange, and a bit mystifying. How could people behave like that? What was going on, and what was Daisy's problem?! Twenty-some years later, the book seems devastatingly simple and completely natural. I know this book is usually billed as a tale of ""the folly of the American dream"" etc. etc. etc., but to me it has never seemed about that. There's an inherent underlying snobbery running through the entire plot, that says any man as successfully self-made as Gatsby must have a criminal past or be involved in shady dealings, and that of course such wealth and success--achieved, not born into--is somehow stolen, undeserved, and the perp must die. I get all that. But it seems peripheral to the real point, at best. To me the real point, the gist, of The Great Gatsby has always been: secrets. Specifically, Lies. Lies and the destruction they leave in their wake, how they will actually kill, and indiscriminately. Lies not only to other people but to yourself: self-deception kills. Not being true to yourself, kills. if not you, then others, and possibly people you love. Daisy living a lie by marrying Tom, Gatsby's entire lifestyle and reason for that lifestyle a subterfuge, Tom living a transparent lie just by virtue of being himself, Nick somehow becoming a sort of grand orchestrator of lies when he brings Daisy and Gatsby back together, after partying with Tom and his mistress the day before. Wilson discovering a great lie about his wife, and going off in pursuit of the truth, with a gun. The entire tragedy triggered by Daisy marrying the ""wrong"" man, and lies upon lies collapsing into one another like a twisted chin of dominoes until Gatsby takes a bullet, literally, for some ""careless"" little bitch who wasn't worth it. That's what The Great Gatsby is really about, for me. "
1725,Pasteurisiert,"… vorgelesen von Burghart Klaussner.Pasteurisiert mit 5 von 5 Sternen. Dekadenter Reichtum in den Zwanzigern und doch ein moralischer Lichtblick.Warum nicht auch einmal einen amerikanischen Klassiker lesen. Immer mal wieder hörte ich von diesem Buch. Eine Vorstellung über den Inhalt hatte ich bisher jedoch nicht. Wenn man bei Audible noch Guthaben hat, jedoch viel zu viel zu lesen unterm Stubentisch (ja, dort sammle ich stapelweise Bücher, weil die Regale voll sind), wird man experimentierfreudig… oder man gibt das Abo auf. Ich habe mich für ersteres entschieden.Nach den ersten Hörminuten habe ich beinahe Ekelgefühle für das langweilige, gelangweilte Milieu entwickelt, in dem der Protagonist seine Freizeit verbringt. Geld stinkt vielleicht nicht, aber es lässt die Besitzer wohl verfaulen. Jedoch, es gibt einen Lichtblick - Gatsby. Er ist nicht wirklich besser, - nur im Vergleich zu den anderen scheint es so.Ein überraschendes Buch, das mir viel Spass bereitet hat, vielleicht gerade weil die beschriebene dekadente Gesellschaft so abstossend gefühllos und kalt ist. Komischerweise ist mir als Analogie zu Gatsby keine Person, sondern die USA als Staat an sich eingefallen. Die Partygesellschaft besteht dabei aus den Nutzniessern einer intakten Wirtschaft.Wie auch immer, das Hörbuch ist ein sprachlicher Hörgenuss. Ich kenne natürlich jetzt nur diese eine Übersetzung, die scheint jedoch sehr gelungen. Burghart Klaussner (Solar, Schuld) ist ein exzellenter Sprecher. Die Story ist tief und gut."
1726,Ruth Ann,"Update: Did you know that there are six movie versions of The Great Gatsby? I found a review of the 1949 version, but the 1926 version is lost.A classic that I read over forty years ago. Reread for our book club and I think it is still a relevant story. Themes: decadence, idealism, social upheaval and excess, portrait of Jazz Age. F. Scott Fitzgerald is interested in human actions and their results. His work is a social criticism of NYC and Long Island in the early 1920's. Lots of symbolism in the pursuit of the American Dream. Oh yes, it is also a tragic love story. (view spoiler)[In the end, Gatsby's dream is his downfall. Gatsby's tragedy is that he choose the wrong dream. Daisy is behind him, unattainable.  (hide spoiler)] In May 2013, a new adaptation of Fitzgerald's work is on the London stage and there is the recent film starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby. The film preview looks absolutely gorgeous in capturing the decadence of the age."
1727,Harper,"Jay Gatsby is a mysterious man, who gives extravagant parties on Long Island, New York, outside his mansion. His neighbor Nick is the only person to be invited to one of his parties, but when he arrives the mysterious Gatsby is no where to be found, and no one else has ever been properly invited. Across the lake a small green light shines. That's how Gatsby knew where Daisy's mansion was. Nick is cousins with Daisy, and Daisy is married to a mean rich man who doesn't really respect her as much as he should. Nick befriends Gatsby, and when he finds out that Nick is her cousin he immediately tells him to reunite the two. Jay Gatsby and Daisy were a couple years before the book takes place, but when he goes away she doesn't think he will be back anytime soon, so she agrees to marry Tom. But can Gatsby get her back? I liked this book because it was an intense thriller, it made me want to read every page over and over, the words rolled of my tongue in perfect harmony. With each party and with each new detail my suspense and curiosity grew. I also grew very fond of this mysterious man, I wanted to know more which made the book better. I recommend this book to anyone who loves stories about romance and suspense. "
1728,Alec Cohen,"Perhaps the best book ever written. The Great Gatsby is short, yet you could spend years on it, rereading it and studying its immense, nuanced layers of brilliance and profundity. As is well known, this book is commonly read in schools everywhere. This may be bad but it may be true: I make the generalization that most school books have great messages and lessons but boring plots riddled with difficult-to-read passages, dull writing styles, and extreme pretentiousness. Oh well; I'm probably wrong about that, but, from my experience, it's the truth. But not with Gatsby. Everything about this book is wonderful. The plot is great. The characters are intriguing. Yes, it's pretentious at times, and the writing can be tough, but I don't mind it here. The lessons of love, betrayal, money, and the downfall that can come with extreme success are fantastically thought-provoking. And there are hundreds of more lessons, smaller and harder to notice, packed snugly in between. Like sardines. SPOILERSLast but not least, I love the last conflicting thought about Gatsby as a human being: is he good, or bad? Is he great, or awful? To me, he is a tragic character trapped by the evils of insane love and desire, as well as the people who come to his parties/greedy society (who come to his parties all the time and not to his funeral). "
1729,Jim,"It's a classic, go read it!"
1730,Maggie Mason,"The movie irritated me, but I hadn’t read the book since college, and couldn’t remember much about it. It was strange reading my old copy where I’d underlined a bunch of passages that don’t resonate with me any more, and every reference to color — I must have been working on a paper.Newsflash, The Great Gatsby is terrific. The kind of book that makes you want to find the author and grin stupidly in his face.Some favorite parts:Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars.…young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.The rest of my favorite quotes are here:http://mightygirl.com/2013/08/08/the-..."
1731,Feisty Harriet,"I read this last year but it was the pick for this month’s book club and I decided to do my due diligence and reread. I was struck by the introduction where the narrator, Nick Carraway, spends the opening paragraph talking about reserving judgement on people because they did not have the same opportunities as he in their lives. The point being that despite the obvious flaws of Gatsby, Daisy, her husband Tom, and Mr. and Mrs. Wilson, we are to not judge their actions or character too harshly. Carraway does a pretty good job of describing the people and events of that fateful summer with a sort of uninvolved, impersonal bias, which is strange for a present character and not an omniscient narrator. Carraway/Fitzgerald allows the reader to make their assumptions on character and motive in many cases, but simultaneously encourages us not to condemn Tom and Mrs. Wilson for their affair, or Daisy and Gatsby for theirs, or for the tragic events that left three of them dead and two completely blameless. I love Fitzgerald’s writing, his style and phrasing and plotting. I really need more of it in my life. After discussing the character, morality, and other symbols and components of The Great Gatsby with a group of bookish friends I fell in love with this book all over again. So many layers and so many perspectives all wrapped up in 180 pages of prose. Swoon."
1732,Danielle Dollinger,"The Great Gatsby is a novel narrated by a man named Nick Caraway. The book takes place in the 1920s and follows Nick's mysterious and ""great"" neighbor, Jay Gatsby. After having lunch with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, Nick is invited to one of Jay Gatsby's famous parties and is asked a favor. Although he is hesitant to oblige, Nick follows through and helps Jay try to get what he desires. I absolutely loved this novel! The ending was my favorite part of the book in that it was tragic and unexpected. All aspects of this book were brilliant, from the plot to the symbolism to the characters to the theme."
1733,Keshia,"How does someone like even touch are grasp a novel like The Great Gatsby in a simple book review. The part about that, is yeah, it's quite difficult to do. Sometimes books are wonderful, and it's just hard for me, no matter how I try or ramble I could not put my love of this book into words. And I could not tell the world just how wonderful it is. And so i won't, I won't spend countless paragraphs trying to convince you of the breadth of this book, of the emotions it touches, or the observations it makes. i'll only say this, this book is an American classic for a reason. And it is, no matter what, worth reading."
1734,Aneel Kang,"The Great Gatsby, a classical piece of American literature, highlights the roaring 20's in American history. Reading it for a second time with a specific active reading lens of (Geography/place), I was able to go into deeper analysis of the text and have a deeper appreciation for the novel. Some of my takeaways from this novel include: Money doesn't buy you happiness (Gatsby), no matter how hard you try, sometimes you can't obtain that orgastic future with the ""green light"" on the other side (Gatsby trying to get Daisy-Green light could really be behind you). Also, I learned to always be yourself and try not to be someone that you are not (Nick should have stayed West). Overall, it's one of my favorite novels ever and I enjoyed reading it for a second time. "
1735,Marvin,The Great Gatsby is amazing. It is easily a top contender for the great American novel and speaks to our generation as readily as it did to Fitzgerald's lost generation of the 20s. Gatsby is an incredible character whose dreams are as conflicted as his ambition in a world that encourages big dreams and delivers disappointment. Nick narrates as both an outside observer to the wealthy decadence of his neighbors but also one who relishes the same life. Tom Buchanan is a lifeless automation depicting the worst of the American Dream while beautiful Daisy struggles to find her place and sacrifices her dreams to an empty fantasy. F. Scott Fitzgerald captured the essence of the 1920s with both longing and cynicism but it is astounding how much of his novel still resonates into the 21st century. 
1736,John Yarbrough,"My wife the English teacher sent me some off the top of her head questions on Gatsby: Consider the idea of the American Dream and the desire to attain that American dream at all costs.If the American dream is a car and a house and a wife, Gatsby grabbed at it and caught it through his criminal activity than tried to steal someone else's wife. But, it didn't stop Tom Buchanan or Daisy to over stretch themselves for their chase after the dram. Read a biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald and see how much his life is in the novel.I would imagine that its similar.Notice the carelessness of the upper class and the negligence of the responsibility in alcohol and automobiles.Fitzgerald takes is time in describing the alcohol and the cars. You felt the luxery and the excess and a little bit of the disdain over it all.Notice there is not one redeemable female and the social commentary that can suggest.There was little respect for the women. Women were thinking on their own and men were trying to control them. It seemed repressive on both genders.Daisy is utterly depressed and in denial--disillusioned with her life perhaps.. What in society contributes to this? And she's not the only one. Fitz describes a a woman as ""shrill, languid, handsome and horrible."" Wow what a description.Everyone is a liar. Why:? Metaphor of the gilded age in America? Social commentary? Or just a device? It all seemed an effort to move ahead.I loved Fitzgerald's phrasing, ""they wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people I didn't know"" He describing a party.Great book. I understand why its studied. I wouldn't mind reading Fitzgerald's bio. "
1737,Stephanie Spines,"I re-read this for the first time since grade 11, but I remember it resonating with me then as well.I think that The Great Gatsby has just earned a spot on my favourites of all-time list.Fitzgerald's language is simply beautiful. It perfectly captures the spirit of the time and is simply luscious and beautiful. I found myself hanging on to Fitzgerald's words and wrapping myself up in them like a warm blanket.At it's core, this story seems to be an ironic telling of the American Dream and that those in pursuit of it and those who seem to have it are not infallable. Perhaps we have constructed some grandiose idea of wealth, but this story demonstrates the illusion of happiness, stability and virtue that exists even when one manages to achieve the endless pursuit. I suppose the illusion doesn't stop at the achievement of the American Dream but also includes the American Dream itself - hence the green light. Even though Gatsby had all the money in the world and could throw fancy soirees, there was still something missing for him. Something blinking far off in the distance that he could make out on the horizon but was just too far away to reach out and grab. And he will never find out what it is.The ending is quite sad and what I found so depressing and stark and hopeless was that hardly anybody showed up to Gatsby's funeral. Despite having all of these ""friends"" that turned up at his parties, nodboy could be bothered to attend his funeral. I guess Fitzgerald did this to illustrate that perhaps there are more important things in life than money and superficial friends."
1738,Manuel Sanz,"Utiliza la técnica del narrador testigo (Nick Carraway), para contar la vida del protagonista (Jay Gatsby). Una novela que pone en cuestión el idealismo americáno: autosuficiencia y oportunidades ilimitadas.El narrador testigo da pinceladas de la vida del protagonista. Un millonario, proveniente de la clase baja que alcanza una nueva posición social utilizando métodos pocos cercanos a la legalidad ( ley seca).Toda la información que tenemos es en cierta forma tergiversada, mediante la narración de Nick Carraway. Cuenta aquello que le interesa y describe al protagonista quizá de forma idealizada. No habla de un individuo, habla de una sociedad, en un momento histórico concreto. El protagonista y el narrador no son ajenos a ésta. Si es falsa, hipócrita y falsa ellos también lo son. La mentira es una forma de auto justificación: la única forma de subir en la escala social es el ""método"" Gatsby. Fuera de esa clase social no hay nada: no hay festas no hay lujos etc.Gran novela un clásico del siglo veinte."
1739,Jastej Sra,"I love The Great Gatsby - I have read it multiple times, every time for school. As I got older, and I began to understand the true story, I only got more immersed in the world Fitzgerald created. Learning the many parallels between the author's life and Gatsby's only made it feel more like you wearing hopping into another reality. Fitzgerald's descriptions of the time and how it gave birth to a whole new type of social caste and people was similar to something I noticed in my own experiences. The novel is an amazing illustration of the time, and how it affected the people who lived in it. It is a classic love story, in which you don't know if you want the girl to end up with Guy 1 or Guy 2 because she truly deserves neither. You take away three main things from this novel: Money affects everyone in a negative way, even those who say they use their money in donation or for positive influence. 2. Everyone is a narcissist - constantly expecting the world to make them happy, and when it doesn't: Hell will break loose. People lose their tempers and desires all to fulfill an intrinsic need to be showered in attention. 3. While it didn't work for the protagonist, it did make him happy: Chase what you want. Passiveness leads to insanity and action only teaches. "
1740,Sunny Cho,Simply amazing. 
1741,Elijah Kasper,"The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a story told through the eyes of Nick Carraway, a man from a well-to-do family from the middle west. Who has moved out to West Egg, where he lives in his small house amongst the rich and wealthy “new money.”On East Egg lived the Tom Buchanan’s, Tom and Nick had gone to college together and Tom’s wife Daisy was Nick’s distant cousin. The Buchanans were from the much more fashionable “old money” and they were the some of the most popular people in Long Island; constantly on the front pages of the newspapers.On West Egg also lives Nick’s extremely wealthy next door neighbor, Mr. Jay Gatsby. Who befriends Nick so that he can rekindle the relationship between him and Daisy Buchanan. Gatsby and Daisy were on the track of getting married and living happily ever after but then WWI began and Gatsby had to go to war like most men did. Daisy promised that she would wait for him forever but she didn’t. Daisy married Tom Buchanan instead and she never talked to Gatsby again. Gatsby has been waiting for an opportunity to approach Daisy ever since and Nick is his best way to her. The Great Gatsby was an amazing book in my opinion I enjoyed all of the different love triangles and things that were happening that some characters didn’t know. I will definitely be reading this book again soon, it was very entertaining and surprisingly interesting to me. I think that this book is a classic because it portrays what America was like for the wealthy and the not so wealthy in the time after The Great War. This story is filled with many different things that would appeal to many different people. I would recommend it to anyone because this book has something for everyone. It has violence, money, adultry, romance, fancy cars, the rich people lifestyle, and lots of complex love triangles that really make you think. Overall I really enjoyed this book and i can’t wait to read it again!"
1742,Bridgette Colleen,A classic that I always love! 
1743,J. Monfred,"The Great Gatsby is a read I will never forget. Compulsive, engaging and enigmatic, The Great Gatsby, I feel, will never bore the classic nor its modern readers as its mix of light comedy, twiddling romance, slice-of-life, jazz and modernist genres is surprisingly charming and interesting.As told by a major supporting character, Nick Carroway, the narrative of the novel is filled with personal remarks and brooding reflections about topics like the past, love, the lifestyle of the rich and a lot more. This is the main reason which makes the novel a good read for me, its believable. It's real. It's a story about one minute unto another. It's something one would feel closely not because of colorful descriptions and whatnot, but because the mind of Mr. Carroway is witty, understandable and the kind of mind people his status would have now.Women take a big part of the novel's themes. Are they simply to be foolish servants of their husbands? Or are they worthy of freedom and decision like men? It was a common issue before, and the novel put it up to question and reflection through Gatsby, who believed in the latter, and Tom Buchanan, who believed the opposite. Although unjustified 'til the end, two characters, Daisy Buchanan and Jordan Baker, did enough for me to understand why the two men think so. Daisy, Tom's wife, is clearly a fool out of love, and Jordan, Nick's cohort, is free, decisive and fiery. The novel packed a great focus on this issue yet not resolving to make the reader think for him/herself.The main theme of Americanism is also a sight to read even though I'm no native. Each character reflects the stereotypes of their time. And Gatsby? Purely an American figure. How did he define being an American? By being a person who, from rags to riches, pursues his dream even though the only thing he clings on to is so little and insignificant. In the novel's case, Gatsby clings on the hope brought by the green lights across the docks.Characters? Simply unforgettable. Many writers say that all characters, even the minor ones, have a story to tell. This novel proves it. Myrtle Wilson, although appearing apparently in only two chapters, was clearly instanced as a woman who knows how to handle his husband. Michaelis, although very minor, was shown to be caring and quite chatty. Readers can find a lot of stories within the story, as Fitzgerald did a good job varying and building characters.The plot, ah, the core wonder of the Great Gatsby. At first, one would thought that the main plot is Gatsby trying to repeat the past by being Daisy's lover, but no. The main plot is the fall of Gatsby's dreams. He held on to the past, him and Daisy happy together, that he thought much of the future, forgetting the present. And who would forget the tragic finale?The Great Gatsby is a beautiful example of a novel symbolizing people of a specific era. It's a masquerade of characters whose lives were left ambiguous. It's a living story."
1744,The Scarlet Pervygirl,"The implications of the American Dream are a lot clearer if you keep in mind that the book is actually about Daisy, not Gatsby."
1745,Jan Jarin,"The moralist fed up, the nice guy drawing the line, The Great Gatsby is well, pretty damn amazing all things considered. From the implicit meanings within various descriptions to the intrigue of Gatsby, I genuinely loved everything about this book. My only beef with this book was its artistic verbal flourishes, some were brilliant, others at times I felt were a bit contrived. Apart from this, the diction, the near steady rhythmic perfection of each line, the rueful tone of hopeless spite, languishing, all wowed me. And the way Fitzgerald goes about probing the American Dream, he doesn't preach with ideas, condemning you, the choir and the congregation, no, no, it's a painful story about personal loss that makes you ruminate. A perspective that makes the abstract definite and here and now. He makes a character that you identify with, and then drags him to his death because it is absolutely necessary. "
1746,Charlotte,"This is now one of my favourite books of all time I absolutely adore this book. I think everyone should have the chance to read it and not only read it but its great to actually research the story behind it and the meaning of certain things and the message that Fitzgerald was trying to portray about it. As part of my A level we studied this book in great detail and I found it that much more rewarding and could appreciate it so much more having properly studied it. A truly brilliant piece of literature that I will return to again and again, and so many brilliant quotes I'll remember.It is brilliant not because of the love story between Daisy and Gatsby, but more for the lack of love story. Gatsby is in love with the idea of Daisy, the woman who he has conjured in his mind, who can never possibly exist or be lived up to. Gatsby also fails to see that through time people change and that the past cannot be relieved. All in all an amazing book and one that should be read and researched a little into, to truly be able to appreciate the beauty of it."
1747,Inesa Yaroshenko,"Jay Gatsby is a mysterious man, who gives extravagant parties on Long Island, New York, outside his palatial mansion , in the warm summer nights. That he doesn't know the people he invites, not to mention the numerous gatecrashers, might make it a little strange! But this being the roaring 20's, anything goes, rumors abound about Gatsby, bootlegger ? Who cares, as long as the free liquor , great food and the beautiful music continues. Finally attending one of his own gatherings, and we discover that he's after Daisy, a lost love, she's married, which complicates the delicate situation. Nick, Daisy's cousin arrives in town and through him, reunites Gatsby with his former girlfriend. She enjoys luxury, which is why Daisy married rich Tom and not poor Jay. A car accident kills Tom's girlfriend, yes he's a creep but a wealthy one, it's vague who's responsible, but her husband thinks he knows. Death in a swimming pool, ends this tragedy and symbolizes the Jazz Age ."
1748,Sara Pavone,"Bellissimo libro, il linguaggio è davvero scorrevole nonostante non sia banale e una pagina tira l'altra, lo si divora. Per tutto il romanzo aleggia un'aria malinconica che fa da sottofondo perfetto a questi ruggenti anni 20 che risuonano in ogni angolo delle note del jazz.Credo proprio che mi avventurerò in altri suoi romanzi, ne sono entusiasta."
1749,Seamus Mcduff,"Like Hemingway said: "" The secret is that it is poetry written into prose and it is the hardest of all things to do."" F. Scott Fitzgerald was a contemporary and acquaintance of Hemingway's, and it is arguable that in this novel Fitzgerald achieved this aim in a way that would have made Ernest green with envy.An example:""The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light.""Of course, the whole thing is not like this. But The Great Gatsby is one of those books that seems difficult to pin down; elusive to say what has given it such a reputation and caused it to endure the way it has. It's not the plot, which by itself wouldn't be enough to recommend it-- though it is a singularly American story of a remarkable man coming up from nothing by his own efforts, only to have it become apparent that there is a dark underbelly to his success. No -- the skeleton of plot doesn't account for its success; as shown by the recent movie (although I must say I appreciated the Baz Luhrman movie a little better after reading the book.It's the language of course. Language, language, language. Duh!But more specifically the dialogue... the conversations of Fitzgerald's characters are so shallow, so blasée, so casually thrown off, so revealing and cunningly observed. Believable dialogue creates believable people. I found that even though the cast of characters were spoilt and ridiculous, absurd in their self-absorption, I couldn't help liking them; couldn't help for example wanting Nick to stay with Jordan Baker, even though she was callous and such a cold fish.My only criticism is that by current standards Fitzgerald goes rather overboard with adverbs -- excessively, ponderously , alarmingly. But tastes have changed, and I'm sure this wouldn't have stood out at the time.Importantly, and the greatest Gatsby feat of all: still seems fresh, nearly 90 yrs later."
1750,Courtney Schmitt,Favorite book of all-time. 
1751,Elisa Luna,"Wow! This book is a true roller-coaster ride. Reading it I felt excitement, melancholy, sadness, disgust, hope and unjustness - and most of all because of the enigma: Jay Gatsby. Even though he is truly great, he is also just a man looking for love, and that was what really moved me. As for Fitzgerald I have nothing but enormous respect for his writing talent - so vivid and colorful and yet, drenched with an underlying critique of social climbing and wealth, which will corrupt lives sooner or later. What I am left with is a melancholy and a sadness; he gave so much, and had so little in return.. "
1752,NuHunni,"I remember my first reactions to this book very well. I had to study this book for year 11 literature in high school, i was looking at the cover for a second or two and quickly had a look at the back for a hint of what the story was going to be about. It looked like a boring book! It sounded like a boring book!! and it was a boring book!!It was such a drainer, all I and almost every other student in the class wanted to know why teachers always chose such boring texts. I mean who cares about what happened in America with the depression ans the Jazz Age. Who really cares?But now that i am a few years older and wiser, I appreciate this book much more. I realised i gave it very little credit than it deserved. Not being at university at the moment and instead working to make ends meat in the real world, I now understand why such issues as depression is a major issue. I know what it does to one, to have no job and feeling of rejection. I know how a job kind of provide you with your identity of who you are, and what your role in this world is. Now I understand exactly what significance the Jazz age had for these people, how important it was to them to keep them sane and happy. And on top of that, love. I know they say moeny cant buy you love, but in the real world, it is very significant in a relationship, this is what Gatsby finds in the text. And having gone through my own relationships, I know exactly what most characters are feeling though the issue of love.So, its amazing how much I have learnt to appreciate from this book just after a little time in the real world, because everyday is a struggle no matter if you are rich or poor and the rules of love is much more complicated than what anyone can tell you."
1753,T. E. Avery,"Can you imagine being in your twenties and writing a novel as amazing as Gatsby. The lyrical prose and rich description and symbolism throughout. I've read Gatsby several times and I learn something new every time I read it. No wonder it has been called one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century. Thank you Scott.""His talent was as natural as the pattern that was made by the dust on a butterfly’s wings."" - Ernest Hemingway "
1754,Michael Fishman,"When we first read this book my junior year of high school, I think I was the only one in my class who liked this book. Many people found it too dense and unrelatable. But something about F Scott Fitzgerald attracted me. I definitely did not appreciate his form, prose, or structure back then. But the message behind the story was one that I, an angsty teenager who was disenchanted by the materialism rampant in my upper-middle class upbringing, was more than able to digest.The Roaring 20s is the backdrop for our story. Fitzgerald (and his wife Zelda) were more than eager participants in the excesses of this epoch in American History. Prohibition may have been the ultimate buzzkill, but those in the know were more than able to have their fun (and plenty of it). And this time was a perfect setting for our illustration of how the American dream had become from what Thomas Jefferson envisioned, to the excesses of the 1920s. The American Dream is ""Keep up with the Joneses."" But I think it's ""Do better than the Goldbergs."" Jay Gatsby was a mysterious figure. Nobody knew his true identity. Only that he threw lavish parties and people loved them. Legends floated about him. He spoke with a posh accent and called people ""Old Sport"", claiming he picked it up at Oxford. But the ""old money"" folks knew that he was an impostor, as his gait and his fashion gave him away. In the end, we find that Gatsby was neither great, nor was he really a Gatsby. We find that despite it all, he was empty inside. We find that even though he does die tragically, only two people attend his funeral. Even his employer, the elusive Meyer Wolfsheim (perhaps Arnold Rothstein, famous for fixing the 1919 World Series), would not attend his funeral. We find that Gatsby had everything, but he still had nothing. And the one thing he treasured the most, the love of Daisy Buchanan, he would never have."
1755,Svetlana Trikidi,"Ok, taking my words back, i love it! And i hope i did get it right... "
1756,Laura Cooper,"Re-read it for A-level exams (reading for the fourth time), change from 4 to 5 stars. Sublime, distorted, symbolic, absurd and tragic; it is America - a car crash. Daisy is a nihilist, all she has is a life of marriage and children, all she can do is say wry, stupids things to men who love her for her voice but not what she says. "
1757,Jacqueline Glz,"Book Read Challenge 2015:  Un libro que tengas pero nunca hayas leídoCreo que lo primero que tengo que señalar es que estoy fascinada por la narración de Fitzgerald en esta obra. Había leído otros trabajos suyos pero este es hasta ahora y probablemente en definitiva mi favorito. Leer The Great Gatsby es sentir con letras la frivolidad de los años 20's.Leí hace mucho en tumblr a alguien que analizaba una frase dicha por Daisy que va: ❝Me alegro que sea niña... espero que sea tonta; lo mejor en este mundo para una chica es ser bonita y tonta❞ y hasta ahora que lo leo comprendo que si bien esa frase puede parecer sexista y censurar el pensamiento femenino se trata más de la infelicidad que tienen las personas quienes piensan demasiado. Daisy no era ninguna tonta, y a pesar de todos los lujos que poseía y de haberlo hecho todo existía una enorme infelicidad relacionada con su inteligencia. Realmente no creo en el romance de Gatsby y Daisy. Coincido con Nick cuando dice ❝...pero si una vez, sólo una vez, lograra regresar a determinado punto de partida y repetirlo todo lentamente, sabría que era lo que buscaba.❞ Creo que la obstinación que Gatsby sentía hacia con Daisy tenía que ver más con tratar de forzar una meta que realmente tener una. Realmente llega a mi la parte en la que ella llora y le dice que pide demasiado, porque realmente creo que lo hace. Es probable que ella haya pasado por un duelo enorme para dejarlo ir y dejar de pensar tanto en él, y entonces él reaparece y le pide que abandone toda la vida que construyó después de aquello. Y al final, como el mismo Nick dice: ❝Había pagado un precio muy alto por haber vivido demasiado tiempo con un solo sueño❞.El final me ha hecho soltar algunas lágrimas, y si bien el libro es una crítica a la sociedad de aquellos años y a la frivolidad humana debo añadir que también se trata de un libro sobre sueños y sobre lo que somos capaces de hacer tanto para conseguirlos como para mantenerlos. "
1758,Helen Stanton,"For about the fifth time in my life .......and ready for the theatre next weekendEach time I read it , I get something new..................looking forward to Gatz"
1759,Lexi,I never thought I'd read a book wherein the prose sparkled just as much as or more than the dialogue. I was totally engrossed and read more than half of it in one sitting before running off to the movie (which is likely to be disappointing).
1760,Marisa,"I can honestly say that this is one of the best books that I have ever read. A story with so many unbelievable twists and turns. It takes place in the 1920s when the times were completely different. This period was filled with immorality and way too many negative traits. In the story we are first introduced to the narrator who is a man named Nick and he moves next to a man named Gatsby. We first hear about Gatsby's outrageous parties and his extreme wealth but then later we find out who he truly is. He is just a man who is in love with Nicks cousin named Daisy. But Daisy is married to a man named Tom who is cheating on daisy with a women named Myrtle. As you can tell the story is filled with many crazy events but it is such an amazing novel that makes all sorts of different points. F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby captures us with its twisted storyline and amazing plot.This book was written because the author wanted to criticize America during this time period. He wanted to share his thoughts on what the world was like after the war and how everything had changed for the worse. The world had suddenly been filled with selfishness, dishonesty, materialism, a celebrity obsessed culture, and no morals. F. Scott Fitzgerald clearly showed his true feelings of Americans during the 1920s through this novel and the characters and themes he chose.  There are plenty of themes in the book but mainly they were materialism, adultery, and selfishness. Starting with materialism we see this plays a huge role when all of Daisy's relationships are based on money and thats the only way she seems to feel safe which causes Tom and Gatsby to also want to remain their social status. A great deal of the characters also committed adultery including Tom, Daisy, and Myrtle. As for the selfishness we can clearly see that depicted throughout the novel through the arrogance and carelessness/ heartlessness of the characters and how they treat the ones they ""love."" I recommend this book to everyone because I loved it so much I think everyone else would appreciate it too. Thank you to Ms. Baltrushes because if it weren't for her then I probably would have never actually decided to read this book on my own time but I'm really glad that i was introduced to it because its now one of my favorites and I really enjoyed it. "
1761,Alaa,"""He was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at Gatsby on the courage of Gatsby's liquor."""
1762,Tiffany Day,"The classic American tale of morality, money, and the fall of the American dream, while irrefutably epitomizing the Jazz Age, still resonates with today's readers as much as ever. The idea of the haves vs the have-nots is probably an issue which humanity will never be able to resolve (I think the 98% -ers would agree) -- compound that with unrequited love and the shortcomings of our fellow man, and you have a brilliant tale sure to be revisited for years to come. I'm not sure I can say I actually *like* any of the characters... and I don't even know if I really care all that much for the story... but it's undeniably brilliant artistically. It's taken me over a decade to read (just couldn't get into it, although I tried several times), but turns out it's an extremely fast and easy read (and it's not very long, either!). Don't just see the movie - read the real deal and THINK for yourself -- there's SO much there to explore! 4 1/2 stars(and make sure your copy has the original cover art ""Celestial Eyes"" - mine didn't, and knowing how influential the artwork was on the author, there were many times while reading I wished I could have flipped back to the cover and ruminated on what I'd just taken in while looking at those eyes)"
1763,Jessica,"Many times we're given a ""classic"" to read in school, 9 times out of 10 the book is so boring it makes me wonder why it was even considered a classic in the first place. However, with F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby I never had that question. Fitzgerald manages to create a world so fantastic and lively that it's almost easy to forget it is still New York City. Just like real life, we aren't faced with too much or too little action. We get the needed drama at Gatsby's wild parties, but still the expected civility at Daisy Buchanan's house. The characters are believable and represent many diverse lifestyles. While the Buchanan's thrive in wealth and luxury, the Wilsons have a hard time making a living in their ""valley of ashes."" Jay Gatsby is somewhere in the middle: not considered as sophisticated as the Buchanans but still enjoys the money he has earned for himself. The narrator, Nick Carraway, simply observes the events. He notices how the different characters interact and does his best to unbiasedly recount them to the reader. Surrounded in affairs and forgotten love, lies and deceit, friendships and deaths, The Great Gatsby transports readers to the roaring 20s for a tragic story they will never forget. "
1764,Ben Balazs,"The Great Gatsby was a fantastic book. It follows the life of a man named Jay Gatsby and the adventures that he went through throughout his life. He was a very wealthy man who has extravagant parties during the very flashy 1920s. Gatsby lives in West egg, which is known for the new money, and the lady in Gatsby’s life, Daisy, lives in East Egg, mainly known for their old money. Nick, the main character, moves next door to Gatsby and tries to learn more about his life for it was very interesting. Nick and Daisy were cousins and once Gatsby realizes that the two are related he uses that relationship to get back into Daisy’s life. We learn later that Daisy and Gatsby had met years ago, however the two fell apart when Gatsby went to war. He was a poor man and she was not interested at the time. 	When Gatsby plans the meeting with Daisy, he was so nervous. He wanted to make sure that everything would look good so she would be impressed. As a result of his work she was. He always knew that Daisy loved him and not her current husband Tom. When Tom learned of this he was not about to have his girl leave him. Tom’s stance of the issue of sharing his wife was interesting as he had another girl on the side. Myrtle Wilson would sneak away from her husband to be with Tom, but daisy was not allowed to be with Gatsby. After an outing with the entire group, Daisy and Gatsby left upset with the turn of events and sped away. But their anger not only caused stress amongst the group, but also with the family of the women that she hit with her car. 	The Great Gatsby gives a great glimpse of what life was like during the 1920s. The liquor was banned but that did not stop it from flowing and the experimenting went on like crazy. The idea of new and old money that is used in throughout the book is very interesting as it was a strange time when people were beginning to look at the lifestyles of their neighbors. The place that their money came from was how some people based their judgment towards people. 	This book is a great read for anyone. It was a good read and a very moving and interesting story. I would recommend it to everyone to read. It was especially good for students who are learning about the 1920s and also the ideas of materialism. It was very interesting to see in the old money sector that people were more worried about being upstanding citizens who had a good face. The new money district tried to show the things that they could buy and what they could do with their money. However in the end it was interesting to see that money did not truly buy happiness and that is a very strong point that people should try to understand. "
1765,Renato Corpaci,"Che cosa rende Jay Gatsby il “grande” Gatsby? Il mistero che nasconde la sua ricchezza? I suoi modi affettati e amichevoli? Il passato fasullo che copre un'infanzia indigente? Tutte queste cose, forse, più la grandiosità che sprigiona dalla casa imponente e dalle feste favolose o dalla cura che infonde in ogni dettaglio di tutte le sue azioni per far colpo su di una sola persona.Il grande Gatsby è un romanzo che evoca l'importanza che rivestono i padri nella formazione dei figli maschi. Fitzgerald vi fa indirettamente riferimento sin dall'incipit:«In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice that I've been tourning over in my mind ever since.»Gatsby, nella sua tormentata vita, di padri ne ha avuti tre: Dan Cody, che lo ha adottato da ragazzino; Meyer Wolfsheim, che gli ha insegnato tutto sul crimine ed Henry C. Gatz, il vechio affranto che compare al suo funerale, il suo vero padre.«Wenever you feel like criticizing anyone – he told me – remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you had.»«Ogniqualvolta tu senta il bisogno di criticare qualcuno, pensa che tutta la gente che c'è a questo mondo non ha avuto le opportunità che hai avuto tu.»L'uomo che rimugina sul consiglio paterno di cui sopra è il narratore di questa delicata storia tra il noir e il rosa che trascende l'epoca in cui fu scritta per collocarsi stabilmente tra le opere di maggior genio della letteratura del Novecento. Nick Carraway si presenta da se stesso: è un simpatico giovane su cui si può fare affidamento per un giudizio spassionato.Le opportunità a cui si accenna nell'incipit, sono sintetizzate nel testo poche righe più sotto come «a sense of the foundamental decencies» ovvero, «una padronanza delle fondamentali regole del vivere civile». Questa storia, dunque ruota tutta intorno alle buone maniere o, piuttosto, alla mancanza di esse, lacuna che, in questo romanzo, sembra abbastanza equamente distribuita in tutta la scala sociale.È Nick, quindi, l'uomo dal giudizio “affidabile”, che, più che presentarci, accenna a Gatsby e lo definisce «un uomo che, pur rappresentando tutto quello che ritengo degno di sincero disprezzo», merita comunque delle attenuanti in virtù di una personalità straordinaria.Trasferitosi dal natio Middle-West nella rarefatta aria di West Egg (nella realtà, Great Neck, una località molto esclusiva sull'isola di Long Island), Nick prende in affitto una casetta confinante con la residenza di un uomo che risponde al nome di Gatsby. Quindi si mette in cerca dei suoi conterranei e amici Buchanan: la cugina Daisy e Tom Buchanan, anch'essi trasferitisi a Long Island dal Mid-West. Li trova in compagnia di un'attraente amica e siccome il mondo è piccolo, ed è specialmente piccolo quello dei miliardari, i tre sono, in una qualche maniera misteriosa, collegati, a Gatsby.Ecco che, nel giro di poche pagine, abbiamo fatto bene o male la conoscenza dei personaggi principali di una vicenda di cui non sappiamo nulla ma che già comincia a stuzzicarci. Senza scendere in ulteriori dettagli e rivelazioni, sintetizzerò qui di seguito, per quei pochi che già non la conoscono, che si tratta di una storia di amore e morte.Quindi, in questo microcosmo alle porte di New York, da una parte ci sono i benestanti, che non hanno altro da fare che essere tali e cercare di divertirsi. Dall'altra ci sono i poveri, esseri indiscreti e zotici, che guardano a ogni minima confidenza da parte dei ricchi come a un'opportunità per ottenere dei vantaggi insperati quanto insignificanti. E poi c'è Gatsby, il vicino di casa.La grandiosità di Gatsby sta nell'incrollabile fiducia in se stesso, nell'irriducibile ostinazione a voler credere che sia possibile ottenere sempre qualsiasi cosa, basta crederci. Anche cancellare cinque anni di vita per ripartire da un romantico idillio. Altri luoghi, altre circostanze, altre persone? Non importa.Nell'«olocausto» finale, come in ogni sacrificio catartico, le vittime sono tutte innocenti. «Si può individuare – scrive Harold Bloom – nel sogno americano il mito caratteristico del XX secolo e Francis Scott Fitzgerald ha, allo stesso tempo, celebrato e satireggiato meglio di chiunque altro quel sogno divenuto incubo»La citazione in apertura ci da il segno di quanto Fitzgerald si sentisse legittimato a giudicare i suoi simili. A leggere Il grande Gatsby, sembrerebbe che quello che lo scrittore rimproverava ai suoi concittadini fosse una diffusa mancanza di dignità, forse perché già allora si cominciava a sentire la mancanza di padri degni di questo nome. La dignità che, in senso romantico, non manca, nonostante le origini umili e l'educazione raccogliticcia, a Gatsby, vittima di un sogno di cui l'eroe è rimasto fatalmente imprigionato.(Renato Corpaci è nato a Milano.

1766,Kristin,"The Great Gatsby was assigned summer reading going into my sophomore year, and sure, I liked it, but I never really got it. After seeing how incredible the movie looks I picked it up again, and now I literally can't believe I let it just sit on the shelf all these years. The Great Gatsby is one of the greatest books I've ever read; it's one of those few books that have completely blown my mind and I feel like everyone needs to read it.By luck, as I was just finishing the novel, I was assigned Gatsby in my AP Literature class's Literary Death Match, aka a fight to the death. By this point I was basically in love with Gatsby, extraordinarily peeved at Daisy, and just detested Tom. I was a mess of feeling for this book and didn't do it justice.But what I wanted to make a point of in the match against Frankenstein was why Gatsby was, indeed, great. After thinking about this central question a lot, I've come to the conclusion that Gastby was great because of his ""extraordinary gift for hope,"" as Nick Carraway famously introduces him as possessing. Gatsby stares out across the bay, living on the wish of a perfect restoration of the past. All of the wealth and riches Gatsby acquires mean nothing if they do not please Daisy; he is only this rich because he wanted to meet her standards. Gatsby is a perfect representation of the American dream: to become something out of nothing, to become wealthy in the monetary sense, but also in the sense that he would be rich having a ""golden girl"". But, perhaps because of the overwhelmingly wealthy lifestyle Daisy has lived her entire life has made her so careless, so unable to appreciate Gatsby. No matter Gatsby's endless waiting, Daisy just did not care, and this carelessness translates directly to the tragedy of the novel. Gatsby was great because he is a manifestation of everyone's desire to live fully. His ambition is what we all have somewhere- Gatsby's was simply clouded by ""foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams,"" or Daisy, the unworthy fixation of his devotion. Gatsby rose from nothing to almost unimaginably rich but the novel really is revealing how this wealth leads to corruption. The Great Gatsby is a perfect account of this life of Gatsby, who cannot be seen as anything less than great."
1767,Olivia,"The Great Gatsby is my favorite book. Ever. Since I knew that I was going to read this book in high school, I never watched the movie or read the book. When I began reading I had no idea what was going to happen; which made reading Gatsby a thrilling experience. I have never cried while reading a novel until  Gatsby.  If you can, try not find out any spoilers before reading!"
1768,David Kerschner,"As a warning, I'm writing this on my phone and don't know how to mark spoilers. Some books you have to have a certain amount of life experience before you can appreciate. This is one of them. Had I been forced to write about this book for a high school English class, no doubt I would have hated it.The characters are pretty universally revolting people. Their wild drunken parties and constant adultery is everything that is wrong with the super rich and their hangers on, as well as a good deal of the rest of society. Tom is a disgusting racist pig. Daisy is vapid and completely self absorbed. Gatsby is just a mask. Nick is the only remotely likeable character.Despite this, Fitzgerald had written a fabulous book. It not just that there is something universal about these characters, it's that there is something of them in all of us. Gatsby creates himself to be the perfect gentlemen, whom everyone likes but we see, no one considers a friend. he's in love with an idealized version of Daisy that never existed and certainly doesn't when he meets her again. Blinded by this vision he's incapable of seeing the truth. Daisy is just the same. Trapped with an unfaithful husband, Gatsby holds for her nostalgia and if not escape then at least revenge. Anyone who views this as a great love story, missed the point and it's just as deluded at the titular character.Even Tom holds up a mirror to ourselves, for who hasn't behaved badly and thought themselves justified, though few go as far as murder by proxy.Nick and his counterpoint, Jordan, portray the honest hopeful and the deceitful cynic. What more can be said about these two. We all have them in some measure.Fitzgerald's prose is wonderful. I couldn't put it down. I was expecting to hate this book. After having read the plot summary on wikipedia, I decided not to read it. I am glad that it was selected for Crash Course: English Lit. Even knowing the climax, it was still jarring and disturbing. I rarely think as highly of a book as I do this one. It really is a Great American Novel."
1769,Maryanne,F. Scott Fitzgerald has an eloquent way of elaborating each scene in this book; making imagery flourish in your mind. I loved this book. I'll read it again the future. 
1770,Laura Valensi,"Definitely, one of my new favourite books of all times."
1771,Keely,"13...? 15...? I can't even count the number of times I've read this novel. I first read it when I was in the eighth grade, and, of course, much of what is beautiful and haunting about Fitzgerald's prose was completely lost on me. I revisited it in college, but it wasn't until I began teaching it to eleventh graders that I began to gain absolute appreciation and adoration for Fitzgerald and Gatsby. Now I get utterly wrapped up and overly-involved every time I read it--and it's the one book that I re-read, cover-to-cover, every year when I teach it to my eleventh grade students. I can't honestly say that about any other literature I teach, except for one other novel--To Kill a Mockingbird--but the way I love TKAM is totally different from the way I love Gatsby. That said, I'm never compelled to read The Great Gatsby all in one sitting as I am with other novels. Maybe it's because I know how it's going to end and I'm not in a hurry to get there, but I love to linger over it now. The language and the imagery and the nuances are clearer to me with every read. The novel seems to change every year for me. For example, I can appreciate the development of Fitzgerald's characters, however, I no longer believe Daisy and Gatsby to be romantic and I no longer wish them a happy ending. When I was younger, I yearned for Gatsy's love to be requited, but as an adult I can appreciate that some relationships are better left in the past.The Great Gatsby gives the reader a solid sense of the rush of energy, money, and glamour the United States experienced in the Roaring Twenties. I'm always aware of the rollercoaster affect the plot has on its characters--especially the narrator, Nick Carraway--and on me when I'm reading. The golden time of the 1920s wedged in between the Great War and the Great Depression seems to be mimicked in Fitzgerald's plot. With a bit of research though, it's easy to find out that these ups and downs were mirroring his life as much as they were the times. I'm not really one who can take literature like this and discount its place in history and the authors life. There's always something there and it's definitely worth noting."
1772,Sierra Chescheir-vemeyer,"F. Scott Fitzgerald has created a masterpiece with this novel. It is truly a classic piece of literature that continues to be cherished and studied generation after generation. This novel fits in with the Modernist movement. The novel is rooted in reality in the 1920s. Fitzgerald speaks through Nick Carraway- the story's narrator. He is a cousin of Daisy and a neighbor to Gatsby himself. In my opinion, because of his close relationship with the main players in the story and because of his voice throughout, I see him as an unreliable narrator. I believe the Fitzgerald uses this novel to highlight his own views on the ideal of the ""American dream"" and the consequences of chasing after only a materialistic life. The dream is to gain fame and fortune and status, as is evident in the character of Gatsby. Yet, his dreams are rooted in a past he is trying to gain through the means of gaining fame and fortune. His dreams are misguided and materialistic and are therefore empty. Because of this his demise is inevitable. Fitzgerald's novel is beautifully crafted and, as I've said before, a masterpiece."
1773,Peyton,"The Great Gatsby is a fun story about miserable people. It is a story of excess, frivolity, stupid decisions, ego, and unmitigated woe... and I love every word. How does Fitzgerald make us care about such shallow, lost people? If I knew the answer to that question, I probably wouldn't enjoy the book so much; the mysterious quality of good writing is better left unexamined. All I know is that I like Daisy even as she is flighty and dishonest, I laugh at Gatsby even as he struggles with obsession and ignorance, I sympathize with Tom even in his cruel monstrosity. These are not people I want to know in my real life, but I wish them well as I encounter them on the page."
1774,Andvari Leitón,"Puede que los que definan The Great Gatsby como ""la gran novela americana"" no se equivoquen en absoluto. Fitzgerald captó el momento, la sociedad, los sentimientos, los sueños y los miedos de la época en un país en el que los jóvenes tenían el mundo a sus pies. Fiestas, nostalgia y el un gran misterio... ¿Quién es Gatsby? La elección de palabras de Fitzgerald es uno de los aspectos más especiales de la novela, y es que en ocasiones no es el qué, sino el cómo. Recomiendo llegar a esta maravillosa novela sabiendo lo menos posible de ella, así que no diré más. Pero leedla. Por obras así amo la literatura."
1775,Yeraldin Esalas,"A mysterious man with no trace of his fame has a long love that will never forget. Jay gatsby fell in love with daisy at a young age and their story has been refounded by Nick Carraway Daisy far cousin that lives right by gatsby mansion. Just as daisy Seemes to forget about her past love nick reunites them. In this book you get to see a couple of theme which are love, hate , relationship and much more.  The theme where showed by different actions like two deaths and even in a date.Reading this book The Great Gatsby  really showed and American dream and in a rich story shows that wealth doesn't really buy everything. What I liked about this book is the moral behind it which I thought was that there is only one person this life that will love you like no other. I say that because gatsby didn't necessarily gave up his life but he loved daisy like no other and maybe his life too. What I also loved about this book is that  many dramatic moments especially the way that  F.scott Fitzgerald way of writing was phenomenal .Something that I disliked about the book is that at time it was hard to read because of the language that was used , but it was understandable because the author was writing the way the character would speak in the 1920's.This book I recommend when a person is looking for a fun book to read at a day at the beach or when they got nothing to do. I would also say that a person should read more than once because they will find something new to the book. This book is also to keep in a shelf it's cost is only 12.99. This book age range should be read from high school and on just because of the language and also for a person to enjoy it . Enjoy :) "
1776,Michael Borshuk,"Genius. One of the three or four greatest novels ever written about American life. It's one of my favorite summer rituals to pull this off the shelf and read it in its entirety (with a mint julep) to commemorate the longest day of the year (so I don't, like Daisy Buchanan, in the book, miss that day when it arrives). Tragic and romantic, with so many lush, quotable sentences it makes me shiver. One of the finest readerly experiences I can imagine--every single time.2015 addendum: what a lovely way to spend a Sunday afternoon. I can think of few works of literature with which I am more familiar, and yet, this one never fails to thrill me."
1777,Jacob J.,"Still one of the finest, smoothest morsels of literary chocolate. And it was made right here in America. "
1778,Jenna Houston,"If I could go back and re-live any decade in the 20th Century, the 1920's would be my first choice, and that is because of The Great Gatsby. The backdrop of the jazz age, flapper dresses, jazz music, a time of extreme prosperity and hedonism all contribute to Fitzgerald's whirlwind narrative. Underneath the facade of popularity and affluence, a plot filled with corruption, jealousy and deceit unravels through the eyes of our not so so reliable narrator, Nick Carraway. He tells of Tom and Daisy Buchanan's shady antics and of Jay Gatsby, a man of self-made riches and wild parties at his huge mansion who hides a not so glamorous past. This book is incredible, and captures my attention on every page. Absolutely worth a read."
1779,"Arianne ""Tex"" Thompson","To me, one of the most depressing things about grad school was reading through great works of literature, finding one that I really loved, digging up criticism and scholarship about it so I could write my double-spaced ode to The Sound and the Fury or War and Peace or whatever... and discovering that the book was all used up. There was nothing I could possibly say about it that would be new. Every possible thought and conclusion had long since been had by dozens of other, more qualified people. Every minor character and allusion was already the subject of half a dozen moldering dissertations. Sure, I went ahead and wrote my little paper, but it didn't add anything to Timeless Academia's conversation on the subject.The Great Gatsby is one of those books. I can't say anything about it that hasn't been said hundreds of times before, and neither can you.But lately, I've been having the most fun with these old books when I can arrange to read them with relatively new people. It's kind of wonderful to read alongside someone who's not had ""Great American novel"" tattooed under their eyelids, who isn't swallowing bile at the thought of churning out a five-paragraph essay at the end of it all - who still has room for virginal surprise and wonder and disgust as they turn the pages.I'm finding this mix of old book, new reader especially satisfying with Gatsby. You get that sense from the city itself: in the summer of 1922, everything is so new and extravagant and full of spectacle that a person could forget just how old and worn-down the world really is. So there it is, my one halfway original thought: if it's been awhile since 11th-grade English and you'd like to try this book again, see if you can get a fresh companion to take you to one of Gatsby's parties. They are really quite something."
1780,Logan Evans,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is truly a classic literary masterpiece and for all the right reasons. This novel has an intriguing plot and an assortment of lively characters that keep you entertained. Fitzgerald created a wonderful book that should be recognized as such for many years to come. This novel is from the main character, Nick Carraway’s, point of view and takes place in the early 1920s. Nick is a nice, loyal, and humorous individual who is a bit impatient when it comes to someone acting ignorant. Nick has recently moved to West Egg in New York and lives in a little shack next to a humongous mansion belonging to the mysterious and prestigious Jay Gatsby. Much like everyone else who has ever heard of Gatsby, Nick is overcome with curiosity regarding Gatsby and his past. After he moves to West Egg, Nick goes over to his cousin Daisy Buchanan’s house to have dinner with her, her husband Tom Buchanan, and Daisy’s friend, Jordan Baker. At dinner, Nick hears from Jordan that Tom is in a relationship with another woman who Nick meets later on in the novel. Later on, Nick is invited to one of the parties Gatsby holds every Saturday and learns that no one is ever invited to his parties, they just go. At the party, Nick asks around about Gatsby so that he could thank his host but he stumbles upon Jordan instead who agrees to help him find Gatsby. After finally meeting Gatsby accidentally, he requests to speak to Jordan alone leaving Nick wondering what they could possibly be talking about. 	A few days after the party, Gatsby invites Nick to lunch and tells him how he has a favor to ask of him that Nick will hear about through Jordan. Nick finds out from Jordan that Gatsby used to know Daisy a long time ago and how they were together before he went to war. Jordan reveals that Gatsby is still in love with her and he wonders if Nick would invite Daisy to tea over at Nick’s house and invite Gatsby as well so he could talk to Daisy. Nick accepts and Gatsby is finally reunited with Daisy. Daisy, knowing about her husband’s affair, decides to replenish their relationship. After Gatsby and Daisy have been together for awhile, the book’s plot takes a turn for the worst including a great deal of anger, drama, fighting, and the loss of a few lives. 	I recommend this book for someone who likes a novel filled drama and that keeps you guessing. The Great Gatsby also has quite a bit of confusing words and phrases so I would suggest making sure you are used to books with this kind of language. Overall, The Great Gatsby is a marvelous book and I am extremely glad I read it!"
1781,Alan Wightman,"Wealthy Gatbsy throws extravagant parties at his Long Island mansion and neighbour Carraway wonders why. Meanwhile, Carraway learns that his cousin Daisy's husband Tom has another lover. And Carraway begins to fall in love with Daisy's friend Jordan. A fine microcosm of the opulent 20s fueled by money from shady sources, with reminders that not everyone is having it so good. You could say it is gritty realism for the very rich.Having just completed The Good Soldier, and having missed the unreliability of the narrator, I was on the lookout for it here, for just like The Good Soldier, the narrator (Carraway) is in the centre of the action whilst hardly contributing to it. He is portrayed as a witness, not a protagonist, or even barely a participant. His curiosity about Gatsby is understandable, but should he have informed Daisy about what Tom has been doing? Does he assume that she already knows but doesn't want to acknowledge it? Should he have allowed Gatsby to surprise Daisy with the afternoon tea at Carraway's house? Despite Carraway not explicitly committing any sins, Jordan says near story's end ""It was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride"". In response, Carraway says ""I'm thirty. I'm five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor"". The beginning and ending passages are famous and outstanding. The prose is thoughtful, clever, and sometimes funny, never flowery. What is the message? Is pursuit of your dreams too dangerous? Maybe only if your dreams are too grand? Try not to be confused by the attractions of the past. And don't always stand back and watch."
1782,Yue,"Apparently, my ninth grade self found Gatsby too much to handle. Or something like that. Because this time I read through it, I was completely sucked in. My opinion remains the same: one of the greatest novels ever written. Tragic, yet beautiful, yet amazing. A symphonic composition.Am still looking forward to analyzing this.Am also super nervous/excited for this movie.UPDATE: THE MOVIE WAS GOOD._______________________________________It started off boring like any other classical books. And don't get me wrong; I love classical books. For me, classical books are like eating a potato and getting the after taste of strawberry heaven. They're hard to get into, but it leaves you breathless in the end.But oh my gosh. Gatsby. This was so damn beautiful. I understand why John Green respects him so much and why Gil from Midnight in Paris adored him so. This book is so tragic and indescribable and F. Scott Fitzgerald has a new rabid fangirl. I can't wait until junior year when I analyze it. Which sounds really really dorky and everything, but for once, this book seems like it would actually be fun.The language and the artistry behind The Great Gatsby makes me shiver. I probably don't understand its deeper meaning unlike the people who have analyzed to death, but the language and diction are so beautiful. I just added fifty words or so to my favorite word list. I love this man.This book is astonishing and heartbreaking and phenomenal.<3"
1783,karenbee,"Oh my god, I actually enjoyed a book written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Someone hold my hand through this confusing time please.Just like the other Fitzgeralds I've read, ""The Great Gatsby"" is full of unlikeable, annoying characters, but the prose in this novel(la) makes up for that. Maybe the fact that it's short helps, too, as one doesn't have what seems like FOREVER to stew about their idiocies."
1784,Sylvia Fournier,"Love the t-shirt: http://www.thuglifeshirts.com/product... ...""Ain't no party like a Gatsby party because a Gatsby party don't stop until at least two people are dead and everyone's pretty much disillusioned with the Jazz Age as a whole."""
1785,alaska,"4,5Oh, Gatsby."
1786,Jennifer,"(this review was originally written for bookslut)When I started reading The Great Gatsby I believed two things: First, that Gatsby was on our 100 best books list, and second, that I had read it before in high school. I now know the first to be untrue and suspect the second. Although there are a great number of books I read in high school that I now only vaguely remember (Wuthering Heights being the other book that I can recall almost nothing of now), I really think I could not have read Gatsby before, as unfamiliar as it is to me now.But really, more importantly, how in the world did The Great Gatsby not end up on our list of books? Jessa just happened to call me shortly after reading it, as I had a list of the 100 books in my hands and had just realized that not only was Gatsby not on *my* list of books to read, but it wasn't on the list at all! Jessa was also shamed by our oversight, but neither of us are at all interested in changing the list now. As much work as it took to make it, I don't want to have to decide which book comes off to make room for it!So how about I just tell you what I thought of the book, as if I were reviewing it for the list anyway? By now, everyone should know the basic plot: Gatsby, a tremendously rich man, is terribly and secretly in love with Daisy, who is married and lives across the harbour on Long Island. The story is told from the point of view of Nick, Gatsby's neighbor and Daisy's distant cousin, who of course gets deeply enmeshed in the whole affair.Now this is a book to read slowly, which is difficult to do as it is so short and the temptation to race through it is overwhelming. (Especially if you do most of your reading, as I do, sitting in a chair facing a wall of unread and accusatory books.) However if you don't read it slowly, you'll regret it, as it will all race by far too quickly, you'll be left wanting more, and the only thing to do for it will be to read it again. Which I would do, if I were not already knee-deep in The Plague, which actually is on the list even though it is not nearly as enjoyable as Gatsby.The Great Gatsby is ultimately a tragedy, a beautifully wrought tragedy. It paints a not too flattering picture of the American Dream through a story as layered as it is simple, as off-putting as it is charming. It is one of those rare books that stays with you after you have put it down. I find that I am warming to it even now, becoming more fond of the characters, appreciating the storyline more.... Yes, I do think I will read this book again before the summer is over.The Great Gatsby is an American classic. If no one made you read it in high school (or if they did, and you can't remember it anyway), you should go read it now. If you do, look for the authorized text, which corrects some annoying mistakes in previous versions. And please, above all, read it slowly."
1787,Elisha,"Update - 29/11/14:I've been thinking about my original rating of The Great Gatsby for months. I reread this around May this year for my A Levels and had the pleasure of delving further into it than I ever did before. I didn't edit my rating back then for some odd reason, but the more I looked into it, the more I loved it. Looking back on my original review, I have absolutely no idea why I even gave this book 4 stars in the first place. I have always loved it, I just learned to love it more as I studied it. If I could award this book 6 stars or 7 stars or 8 stars then I would. This is one of my absolute favourite books of all time and I have no idea what I was thinking when I wrote my original review. So, even though I reread this months ago, I'm amending my rating now because it's bothered me for too long. The Great Gatsby finally has the 5 stars that it fully deserves from me. Now I need to find an excuse to reread it again.-------------------------------------------------------------Original Review - August 2013 (4 stars):One of the things that I try to never do in my life is watch a film based on a novel without reading the said novel first. Unfortunately, I broke that rule with The Great Gatsby when I went to see the new film version with my mum in June. I thought the film was beautiful and I loved the story that was being presented, so when I found out that I'd be studying this book at A Level, I decided that reading this novel was a must. And I wasn't disappointed. The Great Gatsby is a beautifully written and engaging story of love, friendship, hope and how people are not always as they seem. I'm extremely glad that I took the time to read it and I'm looking forward to reading it again in September ahead of my exams.Many of the reviews of Gatsby that I've read have been mixed, particularly when it comes to opinions on the characters, but I personally thought the characters were a highlight of the book. I thought the way that Nick Carraway was narrating a story mainly based on two different characters (Gatsby and Daisy) was a very interesting technique. It was great to see Gatsby grow and develop through Nick's eyes, and I also liked the way that making Nick the narrator gave the story added mystery and also allowed there to be romance without making the romance soppy, as it would probably have been through Gatsby's eyes. Gatsby himself is just the kind of character that I love, and Daisy is another type of character that I love. I like to see characters presented one way that turn out to be completely different, and I love to see innocence turn cruel. Throughout this book, Daisy is presented as a perfect, innocent girl by both Nick and Gatsby and then she turns out to be weak-willed and superficial. I thought that transformation was fascinating, hence why I loved Daisy's character so much. Finally, I also found the character of Jordan very good both in terms of the way she was presented and in the way she appeared to balance out Daisy's character. I loved all of it.Personally, I find it easy to see why The Great Gatsby is regarded as a classic piece of American literature. I loved the themes, the mystery, the foreshadowing, the characters, the narrating and, of course, the world building. The only criticisms I can find is that I'd have preferred the book longer with a bit more detail and that I found it confusing sometimes when it changed point of view, such as when it switches to Jordan's point of view when she tells Nick about when she first saw Gatsby. Other than that, I thought this book was magnificent."
1788,Gary Gilbert,"I almost enjoyed just the words F Scott Fitzgerald used more than the story he wrote. The descriptions are unique, clever, and bring the story to life. "
1789,Mukeary,"I listened to this book, read by Jake Gyllenhall. Listening to it made me especially aware of Fitzgerald's sometimes lyrical use of lanaguage as well as the tragedy of the story."
1790,stephanie,"the end of this novel is maybe one of the best endings ever. pay attention to the use of color throughout - really brilliant. daisy, nick, gatsby, a cast of characters you'll never forget, and the american dream as we know it. "
1791,Blake,"I was subtly impressed by this book and the volumes of thought and care put into so short a piece. I found myself delighting not just greatly in the effect of Fitzgerald's prose, but in the fine details of it. His art here is done as much in what he absents from the narrative as what he provides. The book that says something sad of excess is pleasingly and remarkably deft in excision.Being aware beforehand of many ideas and situations in this book, my experience was of a kind of nausea in the earliest chapters. Steadily, the dreaminess builds from a past encounter, blurred in the excess of idealised memory until a moment of clarity overcomes the Platonic creation of the narrator's Gatsby. The rest contains all the heat, vividness and sobering qualities the earlier chapters give promise of.I well understand why this is a favourite amongst readers and critics. Fitzgerald says something interesting in this work, not just about America, but of hope and its excess, of the results demolishing it and the new life rising from it. His America embodies exceptionally all this work has to say."
1792,Jordyn Oakland,"The Great Gatsby is a classic tale set in the 1920’s narrated by the stories main character, Nick Carraway. Nick has moved to West Egg for the summer and lives next to his second cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom. However, Nick’s main interest stems around a very wealthy and very mysterious man: Jay Gatsby. A friendship is soon formed after Nick meets Gatsby at one of his enormous parties. Not long after Nick begins to learn the underlying secrets between his new friends resulting in a shocking conclusion. This book is definitely aimed towards a more matured audience, such as high school students; I feel that it can be used to help students strengthen and practice their understanding of similes and metaphors. The teacher can pull various similes and metaphors from the book and have the students interpret what Fitzgerald is implying and how it strengthens his writing. Fitzgerald, F., & Bruccoli, M. (1996). The great Gatsby. New York, NY: Scribner."
1793,Doctor,"This novel was a fantastic look at the 1920s culture, Mr. Fitzgerald, and at issues that still exist in modern culture. From Mr. Gatsby himself to Nick and Jordan, this novel is filled with only the best of characters in an unbeatable literary ensemble. Kudos"
1794,Carter Beaulieu,"This novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a true classic, filled with themes and symbols that are still relevant in today's society. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel, as it was packed full of intriguing plot and setting, while only consisting of under 200 pages. My three takeaways from The Great Gatsby are these: Even the wealthiest on the outside have insecurities on the inside, people will do anything to achieve their own American Dream, and the eyes of Dr. TJ Eckleburg are always watching. Overall, I recommend that everyone reads this book at some point in their life, as it is a timeless work that provides insight of the nature in humanity during the 1920's, one of the most exciting times in American history."
1795,Nick,"Inspired by the recent ""reading"" play (""Gatz""), which I did not get to see in NYC, I picked up this wonderful audio version by Alexander Scourby, one of the great voices. The beauty of Fitzgerald's prose, those perfect sentences and the blank-verse meter are even more apparent than my memory of reading it (which was, after all, decades ago). The plot, it's true, is almost classically ""tragic,"" in the sense that embedded in the soul of the main characters lives a character flaw that, at least in part, leads to the bad outcome, one which of course, works symbolically as well as the definitive deconstruction of the American dream, a house built on sand, a whole people buying the lie in order to succeed. In today's context, of course, it seems quaint. Swindlers on a scale unimaginable back then get away with anything they try, indeed, are rewarded for it, not murdered and certainly not seen as shameful. Ironically, it's the same character defect,is it not? This audiobook was pure enjoyment. "
1796,Rayan,"It all starts with Nick he’s a poor man but not that poor who lives in a small house next to Gatsby. Gatsby is a mysterious billionaire who owns a party central next to Nick’s house.Then to make understand the story nick and jordan are in couple together. Jordan tells Gatsby that he could really meet his pre-war girlfriend daisy. So daisy is nick's cousin and Gatsby is in love with daisy. She refused to love gatsby back instead she loved Tom Buchanan. Nick then Arranges a meet-and-greet between gatsby himself and daisy and it went well. Tom sensed something weird and came to Nick's house where he got into a big fight with gatsby. Daisy then discovered that tom had a secret girlfriend so she decides to run over her and kill her and so she did. The secret girlfriend of tom has a husband too called Myrtle. Gatsby denounced to the police that it was him that killed Myrtles cheating wife or toms cheat. Tom was the one who said to Dead Myrtle's Husband that gatsby killed her. Dead Myrtle's Husband husband shows off in Gatsby Central party Mansion and kills Gatsby. Nick then decides he had enough of the east coast so he returns to the midwest but not before stopping to remember Gatsby and Gatsby was a unforgettable and courageous man to Nick. My first question was list five facts you learned from this book. So I've learned that Gatsby loved Daisy, Nick’s cousin, I’ve also learned that Tom Buchanan; Daisy’s husband was cheating on his wife with another woman cheating on her husband. Third I’ve learned that daisy killed her cheating husband's adventure wife. Fourth I also learned that Gatsby denounced himself as the murderer who killed tom buchanan’s adventure wife. Last but not least I’ve also learned that Gatsby was killed by Myrtle's Husband thinking that Gatsby really killed his wife. My Second questions was; Which part was interesting to you?Explain. First I liked the part where gatsby himself goes to daisy a poor but not that of a poor women and falls in love with her. But, no matter how Gatsby is rich she won’t love someone because of his money she will marry someone for love. My last question was; Do you think your friends will be interested in reading this book?Why or why not? First I would think the majority of the class will dislike it because it hard to imagine and understand the rhythm and sense of this story. Second I would recommend it to people that have patience.I would recommend this book to adult’s, high schoolers and some middle schoolers. I would recommend this book to middle schoolers who have a basic and higher lexile. I would recommend this book to people who want to challenge themselves as I did reading this book. I would recommend this book also to middle schoolers who have patience and can imagine this story well because it’s hard to get the rhythm and sense of the book. I would recommend this to adults who have been in love experiences. "
1797,Nico," There was just something about this book that was so beautiful to me. When I finished it, it seemed like I had just finished one of the best books ever. Maybe after repeat readings that feeling will fade a little. I am certainly aware that the characters are a little annoying and unrealistic, but in spite of that, the prose and style of writing just seemed right to me. I don't know what it is exactly, but on this first reading it just clicked for me."
1798,John Dreese,"When I read this book in high school, I didn't care for it. However, it's a very different book having just read it again through the eyes of a grown-up. It's like being a fly on the wall, watching how the upper crust interact with people. Some of the language has become dated, one word in particular has drastically changed meaning. However, much of the dialogue could be from a modern novel. It's funny to see them refer to the National Biscuit Company (now called Nabisco). It's not a very long book, but it packs a lot of story into it and it reads quick. "
1799,Fred,"A beautifully written, tightly constructed book. (What makes it great, by the way, has very little to do with ""the American Dream."")"
1800,Rita,"The Great Gatsby perfectly reflects the era that was the 1920s. It's a time that I love, with the bright lights and the big cities filled with men and women running wild and free. For me, it feels like a bit of a revolutionary age: a time where women wore short dresses, make-up, heels, short hair and had fun. It's a step away from the reserved society that had once prevailed. It's exciting and exhilarating, a new world that once existed brought back to life.But what really impressed me was the rich description that made everything vivid. The whole feel of this time was captured in the pages; A wild, carefree, reckless universe filled with parties and bright young things. It betrayed the brightest era as also the darkest of them all, where secrets lurk in every corner hiding behind the dazzling jewels and jazz music. It's a haze of smoke and love stories. Passionate and timeless. For me, it became a burning candle, at its brightest before it burns out. The characters were mirror images of this world at the same time. You had charismatic Gatsby; charming and lovely who you just needed to know. But also a man unable to let go of the past. There was Daisy Buchanan; pretty, breezy and passionate. Nevertheless, a girl who can't bear to leave her own world. With them came Nick Carringway, Tom Buchanan, Jordan Baker and the rest. All intoxicating characters who seem so unbreakable at first and are left with ending that doesn't seem to fit with their firstly flashy lives.The truth is, you don't realise how brilliant The Great Gatsby is until you finish it. It's the kind of novel that truly gets you thinking and feeling because there is not a right or wrong way to feel about the characters. In the end, they all have quite sad endings, and it feels impossible to root specifically for one character. But it shows the complexities of us all as humans. We aren't all good or bad, because we all have our downfalls. We let ourselves do stupid things for stupid reasons and it's often messy, complicated and bitter.But then this story seems to showcase that even more than usual. The characters seemed so wrapped up in their fierce display of their dreams and loves, that when they retreat back to their comfort zone, to the temptation of careless living it is a sorry sight. It's that vision crumbling amongst the greed of money and riches to become that faint image in the past of could-of-beens, when that burning candle is smothered out. An end to the spectacular world of feathers and dazzling lights, just like the end of the 1920s came to a crash. The Great Gatsby could be a metaphor for it's time, and is perfect for those looking to get into classics like me. I would recommend it to everyone.- See more Reviews at: Weaving Pages."
1801,Annie ,"Oh! What a character! What shadows haunt at his feet, what yarns does his heart spin?Jay Gatsby, or the great Gatsby, is the forlorn figure at the centre of the story who is introduced in one of the most epic scenes in American literature. Nick Carraway, the narrator, first sees Gatsby as this solitary figure standing at the edge of the pier with his hands outstretched as though yearning for something across the waters. The subject of this passion turns out layer to be Daisy Buchanan, who as much as The Great Gatsby is considered to be the Great American Novel, in the same breath inspires hatred and revulsion. Daisy is the beauty at the core of the storm who strongly gives one the opinion of being a fanciful child. There are so many things wrong with the character, that one can seldom discuss this novel without entering into a heated discussion on the vice that is the character Daisy. She gives me the distinct impression of a leaf being blown willy nilly by the sombre wind. Although, in the end she of course settles for the more comfortable of the two choices and that is the crux of the hatred inspired in the readers of this story. This melancholic character given to bursts of cynicism, informs that her acceptance of her husband’s double life had started weighing on her. There are heart stopping moments when apparently with a clear vision of her love for Gatsby, she wants to run away from it all; but the ultimate fallacy wins over and any hope for the character is buried. The deeply flawed character of Daisy is in fact wherein the genius of this novel rests. Beyond the grandiosity, behind the lavish parties and the silk and the free flowing champagnes, are the chinks in the armours. Take Nick Carraway. He belongs to the class of people like Buchanan. Thanks, to an ancestor who sends a proxy to fight the Civil War and stays back to make money. This origin is hardly a shade darker than Gatsby’s himself, but when considered in queue of the characters: Daisy and her husband, Gatsby, Carraway, the mechanic and his unfortunate wife; this story is a brief and superfluous look into the Original Sin, or the Human Nature. 
Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace. For awhile these reverses provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy's wing.
Everyone in the novel seems to give over to concocting schemes of delusions while deluding themselves. Jay believes that he will get the girl of his dreams when he is rich enough, yet when Daisy ventures to mention that dream and running away and leaving it all behind, Gatsby is the one who finds it hard to part from his loot. Tom Buchanan makes an accomplice of Nick, never realising that Nick is playing matchmaker to his wife and the rich elusive. Nick himself is deluded to the character of Jay, or perhaps his delusions are deep rooted delusions of the Great American Dream. Jay Gatsby is introduced as the man with his arms outstretched towards a green light, was this meant solely for Daisy, or was it to signify money in the mix too? Considering that this was written in the years before the Great Depression that were rife with prohibition, cutting a bylane to drugs and money; this might just be true. Indeed the story is ripe with criticism for what comes to be known as the Roaring Twenties with its flapper girls and its Jazz Age.
Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther....
The promise, the hope in the story is elated instinct. Until all comes crashing down. It is seldom, that a book that is hyped to an inch of its soul lives upto the promise. The Great Gatsby is an exception, in so much as: It delivers.
So we beat, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.
"
1802,Mary Morris,"I love this book for its clarity and ostensible simplicity. Talk about letting the story tell itself. A masterpiece, as always."
1803,Lena,"Everyone thinks I'm silly for loving this book as much as I do. The Great Gatsby is my favorite school read ever and I get that others don't like it because it's ""sad"" or ""too depressing"" but I think it teaches a valuable lesson about America. Gatsby becomes so obsessed with Daisy that he doesn't even realize that it ISN'T her that he longs for. He sees her as the final piece in his success, HIS TROPHY. I think it really says something about the 20s and their obsession with materialism. One of my favorite lines from this entire story is:""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy - they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made . . .""Those on top will always succeed no matter what. The American dream of ""rags to riches"" is simply that - a DREAM. We continue to long for more and more and more and we never stop because that is our nature. Enough is never enough. We always want MORE.There is so much more symbolism in this book and I'm not going to delve into it because I don't want to turn this into an essay.This book is absolutely magnificent. Sometimes, I wonder what it would be like to live during the Roaring 20s . . ."
1804,Mrs. Odie,"I somehow got through high school and college (with a comp lit degree) having never read this novel. Not because I'm a slacker; it was never assigned to me. The first time I read it was around 2001 or 2002. I was teaching 11th grade English and it was part of the curriculum, so I had to finally read it. I disliked it. In my view, it was a book about terrible or uninteresting people doing terrible or uninteresting things. I was about 30-years-old, but a young thirty in terms of wisdom. I taught it for the first time in 11 years this past semester, and it's a devastatingly beautiful book. I fell in love with the narrative voice of Nick Carraway. This isn't just a novel about terrible people doing terrible things. It's a novel about white privilege, the empty promise of the ""American Dream,"" and how we cannot change where we come from no matter how much we want to. It's about how humans are tribal animals and make nice and intermix for the sake of romance, entertainment, recreation, and shallow friendship, when it's time to close ranks, they stick with ""their kind."" I look forward to teaching it next year and for years to come."
1805,Amir HP,"گتسبی بزرگ: ناگهان یک مه صیح گاهی«شگفت انگیز» بی‌شک تنها واژه‌ای است که در ابتدا، میانه و انتهای کتاب گتسبی بزرگ دائماً در ذهنتان پرسه می‌زد. داستانی حیرت آور با توصیفاتی جادویی که بارها گیج می‌مانی که این کلمات چطور به ذهن اسکات فیتس جرالد رسیده است. کتابی که هر لحظه حس می‌کنی فوق‌العاده است اما وقتی به انتهایش می‌رسی متوجه می‌شوی که فوق‌العادگی‌های قبلی در برابر این پایان ناگهانی کم می‌آورد. پایانی که خیلی آرام بدون اینکه اصلاً متوجه شوی تو را می‌بلعد.توجه: این نوشته ممکن است حاوی اسپول باشد، ممکن است هم نباشد.شاید یکی از بزرگترین اشکالاتی که می‌شود یه اکثر داستان‌های ایرانی گرفت این باشد که روح نویسنده در آن جریان ندارد همه صرفاً قصه‌هایی هستند که تعریف می‌شوند اما گتسبی بزرگ رمانی است که نویسنده تنها یک راوی صرف نیست. رمان گتسبی بزرگ سراسر رازآلود است. شما حتی پس از اتمام کتاب هم متوجه نمی‌شود گتسبی که بود و چطور آن همه پول درآورد زیرا هر آنچه که از او گفته شده از زبان دیگران بوده و از نظر راوی هم او گتسبی «بزرگ» است. وقتی «تام» (به نوعی دشمن گتسبی) می‌گوید که فهمیده گتسبی چه کاره است شما بدون اینکه حرف او را باور کنید از روی گفتارش عبور می‌کنید. شما هر چقدر هم تلاش کنید نمی‌توانید گتسبی را در دسته‌بندی‌های خوب و بد قرار دهید. من ساعت‌ها سعی کردم اما موفق نشدم. هرچند در نهایت ذهنیتم به سمت راوی داستان متمایل شد و ناخودآگاه او را دوست دارم.تصویری که اسکات فیتس جرالد از گتسبی ترسیم می‌کند تصویری است به وجود آمده از اشاره‌ها و ضد اشاره‌ها، از شایعات و کنایه‌ها، از حقایق باورنکردنی و دروغ‌های شنیدنی، از پچ پچ مهمانان در گوش هم.احتمالاً پس از اینکه کتاب را تمام می‌کنید اولین فکری که به ذهنتان می‌رسد این است که باید دوباره بخوانیدش. من تصمیم گرفتم که پیش از آنکه فصل آخر کتاب را بخوانم فیلم گتسبی بزرگ محصول ۲۰۱۳ را ببینم و اکنون خوشحالم که این کار را کردم چون تأثیر شگفتی در درک من از ماجرا داشت. در حقیقت دیدن فیلم بعد از مطالعه کتاب به من دو کمک بزرگ کرد. اول اینکه کمک کرد قسمت‌هایی را که به خوبی درک نکرده بودم بهتر بفهمم و دوم اینکه اشکالات فیلم بر ذهنیتم از داستان لطمه نزند. داستان گتسبی بزرگ خیلی بیشتر از کتاب‌هایی که تاکنون خوانده‌ام در لفافه‌ای از توصیفات ادبی پیچیده شده است و بسیاری مواقع این موضوع باعث به حاشیه راندن شخصیت‌ها و قصه می‌شود. شما در هنگام تماشای فیلم این فرصت را دارید که بدون آن حواشی تنها مشغول داستان شوید و روایاتی که مطالعه کرده بودید را بهتر درک کنید. توصیفات و فضای جادویی که به آن اشاره کردم از ملموس‌ترین نکاتی است که به وضوح در فیلم دیده می‌شود. فضا به شدت شلوغ و رنگارنگ است و طراحی‌های صحنه و لباس یک ویژگی مهم فیلم به شمار می‌رود. صحنه‌هایی که به خاطر رازآلودی در کتاب بسیار کم و سر بسته به آن‌ها پرداخته شده در فیلم از ماندگارترین سکانس‌ها هستند. مثلاً صحنه تیر خوردن در انتهای فیلم یا دیگری توصیف خاکسترزاری که در بین راه لانگ آیلند و نیویورک قرار داشت و نیک دائماً از آن عبور می‌کرد.گتسبی نماینده آمریکای دهه ۲۰ است، نماینده ملتی که در اوج سرافرازی و اعتماد به نفس آلوده به فساد اما در راه دست یابی به ستارگان بودند. گتسبی جلوه گاه همه چیزهایی است که به نحوی خاص و منحصر به فرد و پر شکوه امریکایی است. او مظهری است از شکوفایی ملی زاییده استعدادهای نهفته کشور. به طور خلاصه او قهرمان امریکایی نمونه و ایده‌آل است.با این حال فیلم در قبال داستان ضعف‌های زیادی هم داشت. در حین مطالعه داستان شخصیت جی گتسبی را فردی آرام، خجالتی، درون‌گرا یافتم از همان ابتدا نزدیک‌ترین فردی که به ذهنم خطور کرد هامفری بوگارت بازیگر اول کازابلانکا بود. اما دیکاپریو شخصیتی کاملاً در تضاد با این خصوصیات است. او که در فیلم‌های اینسپشن، شاتر آیلند، جانگوی آزاد شده، گرگ‌های وال ستریت شخصیتی کاریزماتیک و سرکش دارد به سختی در این نقش باور می‌شود.
حقیقت این است که جی گتسبی ساکن وست‌اگ در لانگ آیلند زاده تصور افلاطونی خودش بود. مانند چالز فاسترکین مظهر خیالی و داستان دیگری از دوران ورنق اقتصادی آمریکا است. گتسبی با وجودی که در قلب راه و رسم فاسد و فاسدکننده‌ای زندگی می‌کرد معصومیت خود را حفظ می‌کند و تا پایان کار به صورت موجود رمانتیک سرسخت و غیر نادمی باقی می‌ماند که نیروی پیش راننده و نگاه دارنده وجود او عشق به دی‌زی است، چیزی که فیتس جرالد آن را «جوشش حیاتی توهم غول‌آسایش» می‌داند. گتسبی سرانجام بدون کمترین پشیمانی غرامت گزافی را به خاطر اینکه «مدتی بیش از حد دراز با رویای واحدی زندگی» کرده است می‌پرازد.
تا پیش از خواندن فصل آخر، گتسبی بزرگ یک آدم معمولی است که روزگاری عاشق بوده و حالا بعد از پنج سال دوباره عشقش را پیدا کرده. با خواندن فصل آخر است که گتسبی بزرگ تازه شکل می‌گیرد، تازه همه چیز را از ابتدا با خود مرور می‌کنید و می‌فهمید که او هیچ چیز نبود جز یک رویا. از ناکجا پیدایش شد، عشقش را به دست آورد اما چون هیچ چیز نداشت به او نرسید، دوباره پنج سال هر کار کرد تا روزی آن نور سبز رنگ آن سوی دریا را در مشت بگیرد و آخر… همان‌طور که آمده بود همان‌طور هم رفت. حتی لحظه مرگش هم در داستان گم است. انگار اصلاً برای نماندن آمده بود. همان‌طور تنها آمد و تنها رفت و در میان رویاهایش محو شد. گتسبی بزرگ بیش از آنکه یک انسان باشد یک رؤیا و شاید هم تنها یک مه صبحگاهی بود.
گتسبی به چراغ سبز ایمان داشت، به آینده لذت‌ناکی که سال به سال از جلو ما عقب‌تر می‌رود. اگر این‌بار از چنگ ما گریخت چه باک، فردا تندتر خواهیم دوید و دست‌هایمان را درازتر خواهیم و سر انجام یک بامداد خوش… و بدین سان در قایق نشسته، پارو بر خلاف جریان بر آب می‌کوبیم و بی امان به طرف گذشته رانده می‌شویم.

1806,Dray,"i fucking love this book.THE SYMBOLS! Good god, the symbols in this book are an English teacher's dream! The green light at the end of the dock... Dr. TJ Eckleburg...I could discuss it for days!I love that I can debate the meanings of aspects of The Great Gatsby with my English teacher colleagues and that everyone can have a different interpretation. (Although my interpretations are totally the right ones. I mean, at the end of chapter 2 the ‘Beauty and the beast… Loneliness… Old Grocery Horse… Brook’n Bridge’ part is clearly Mr. McKee showing his photographs. I refuse to believe it's just Nick being drunk, as one of the teachers argued with me.) And it's not just the symbols that have me all hot and bothered, it's the language! I'm just quoting from memory and don't have the page numbers...sue me...but check this out:""His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one."" MMMMHMMM Mr. Fitzgerald keep that sexy diction coming!""No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart."" YES! YES!""I think that voice held him most, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn’t be over-dreamed — that voice was a deathless song."" YOU ARE MAKING SWEET, SWEET LOVE TO THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE!And that, folks, is what is known in my household as a Great Gatsby-Gasm.PS. I can at least tell you that all of those quotes were from chapter 5.PPS. Yes, some beer was involved in this review. But it was mostly fueled by unadulterated passion for this book. "
1807,Katherina,"There is next to nothing I can say about this timeless classic that hasn’t already been said. I guess the best I can muster up is that I absolutely love it! The story can only be described as purely human. The characters are driven by a logic that doesn’t quite make sense, a passion that appears emotionless, and a kindness that (more often than not) is absent of sympathy. In short, The Great Gatsby exemplifies all the fallacies found in the human condition. It says a lot when a novel is still clearly pertinent and applicable nearly a hundred years after its publication, as is true with this piece. This is a true classic and deserves to be; my highest recommendations to anyone interested in reading it. "
1808,S.x.x.,"If you feel you've missed out on the wild parties of the 1930's upper crust, you won't after reading Fitzgerald's early metafiction with his flair for fine prose."
1809,Katherine,"I thought I ruined my first experience reading The Great Gatsby, since I knew exactly how it ended before even finishing the first chapter, but reading it has only made me realize that my experience was just as fulfilling as that of someone who had no prior knowledge of anything about this book.The thing is, I was behind in reading this along with the pace of my class, which assigned this over a span of two weeks. Ample time to read this book, that is, if you don't have the workload of a junior in a rigorous high school.So I appealed my worries to my teacher after giving her a late journal on the book, and resolved to read it during Spring Break. Little did I realize that all of Spring Break would pass, and I'd be forced to finish it in two days.I thought I would dislike the experience, and therefore the book, but it was just the opposite: I loved Gatsby, and I could realistically see myself rereading this novel. And I'm not the kind of person that rereads books, let alone classics. I expected it to live up to its hype, and it did, but in a more subtle way than I first realized. The delicately-crafted prose starts to hit you when you take a second to think about what it means, and you can't help but be amazed by Fitzgerald's talent. Some say it's hard to relate to the characters in this nouveau et vieux riche drama, but I found their stupidity quite easy to empathize with. It's hard to explain, but Fitzgerald frames his characters in a way that you can't help but do so. (view spoiler)[Your heart will be broken by Daisy, and you'll slap yourself for being stupid enough to get caught in her trap of carelessness. I know I was. Nick will probably tease ""I told you so,"" even though he fell for the same trap with Jordan.  (hide spoiler)]If I had read it during the hustle and bustle of school time, I wouldn't have had the gleeful joy of writing in the margins and making connections between characters. But at the same time, I tried reading this during a ""perfect"" time so that I'd assure my love for this book, but as growing reader, I'm realizing that there is no ""perfect"" time to do so. Just have your pen and highlighter in hand, open the goddamned book, and read it. If the book is of any worth, it is sure to win you over. Now, I'll look forward to revisiting my notes in Gatsby again, and, of course, watching new movie.(Side note: I bought a new copy of this book just to write in it. For $16. Yes, I'm aware that this is in the public domain, and that I could have owned it for pennies. Judge all you want, but you can't touch this.)"
1810,Molly Ann,"I really enjoyed this classic. While many of the characters were shallow, this was the point and added to the setting. I enjoyed all the symbolism and the ending surprised me. This was probably the best book we had to read for summer reading this year, old sport."
1811,Srishti,Absolutely love the way it's written and described and the choice of words. Can't explain exactly but it's my new favorite. :D
1812,Lena Valerio,"La luz verde, el gris del valle de las cenizas, el amarillo luminoso de los años veinte. Una paleta cromática del sueño americano, los vestidos, los coches, y el catering donde todo el mundo está invitado a contemplar lo que parece encantador, un estilo de vida emocionante que cae con caída de la clase social y todos los sueños en un real donde la justicia no existe.Todos somos un asistente más a la fiesta de Gatsby, bebiendo champán, bailando, viviendo una historia de amor sobre entrega y apariencias. En definitiva un libro difícil de abarcar y sobretodo de olvidar.Sellaría este apartado con un montón de citas del libro pero prefiero que las leáis vosotros."
1813,Ahmet Ahiskali,"Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known. (p. 48 l. 33-35)As I went over to say good-by, I saw that the expression of the bewilderment had come back into Gatsby's face, as tough a faint doubt had occured to him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams- not through her own fault, but because of the colossial vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. ''No amount of fire or freshness can challange what a man can store up his ghostly heart.''"
1814,Chuck,"As always, this book provides something new everytime I read it. This time through, I noticed the humor and irony throughout; Nick Carraway is really a very funny guy!Saying anything at all about a novel like this is always a risk--something that many people have read and most have an opinion about. But this is, you'll note, my only 'five star' book on my shelf. Believable characters, a story you want to read fast because it's compelling, language so beautiful you want to slow down and enjoy it, so there's a constant push-pull between the desire to find out what happents next and the impulse to slow down and savor, a serious theme, and it made me laugh out loud at least once--most of the crieteria I have for 'a book'--my highest compliement. Good stuff. Highly recommended if perchance you haven't; worth going back to if you have."
1815,Claire,"Read it several times. Reading again for book club. A fav of mine.Just finished it today. Then watched the movie (1974) with Redford and Mia Farrow. Loved them both. I know more about Fitzgerald then I did at last time, and that's helpful insight to the time period. "
1816,Writetome51,"Can't do it justice by summarizing it. Can't really explain why I love it so much, other than saying it's the best narrative writing I've ever read. It's about improving yourself, obtaining your dreams, and how some people lose it all due to lack of ethics, and how others lose it because life's just not fair."
1817,Je,"Fitzegarld mi ha turbata, nella semplicità di una storia che poteva essere un storia qualunque riesce ad arrivare a toccare nervi scoperti, paure reali. Una trama costruita sul ""non detto"", l'ambiguità, i fraintendimenti: Fitzegarald mi ha portata quasi alle lacrime.Di Gatsby mi sono innamorata, poche volte sono giunta a una tale empatia con un personaggio e Daisy quanto mi ha delusa. Scrivere un commento è difficile, questo libro parla della vita e riesce a farlo in poco meno di 200 pagine con una profondità che sconvolge. Resta l'amara sensazione che quel mondo non sia poi così lontano da quello di oggi."
1818,승재 김," To call this book is really touching story. The man who has all the power is wasting his all reputation and just try to love who he liked. After reading book i searched more about ""The Great Gatsby"". And I noticed that they had made movie so i thought when they bring back the like all the parties and jewelries and decoration in visual-able it will be so good. So i Watch the movie Because English is my second language understanding book by owning imagination is pretty hard. When i saw the movie. I could totally match up what is going on and what happened. And it was really good movie. If you read the book I strongly recommend you to watch the movie too. "
1819,Haylo,"I was made to read this for A Level a few years back, and was (and still am) so glad that I was. I fell in love with the character of Gatsby instantly. Fitzgerald avoided making Gatsby a shady and unlikable by giving him a soul among the backdrop of 20s decadence. I loved the way that appearances were always deceptive in the novel (and Fitzgeralds descriptions were wonderful in highlighting this). Normally when faced with a childish and selfish character such as Daisy, I switch off, yet Gatsby's love for her was enough for me to sympathise slightly with her. For me, this is a rare feat - Wuthering Heights fell short of this in my opinion. Nicks broken story telling, and the lack of indulgence into his own relationships did, however, leave me wondering. Nevertheless, the Gatsby-Daisy story was rounded sufficiently.On the whole, The Great Gatsby is a thoroughly enjoyable book. "
1820,Andrew Duggan,"In the 1920s, many Americans had a dream. One man in particular had a dream that he desperately tried to achieve, and his name was Jay Gatsby. The story is told through the eyes of Nick Caraway, a Yale graduate looking to learn the bond business. In F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, Jay Gatsby attempts to woo Daisy Buchanan, his old lover, by showing off his secular materials. Gatsby has Nick arrange meetings for Daisy and him to meet, hoping that their love can once again be revitalized. After a while, Nick realizes Gatsby's dream of wanting to win Daisy's love once and for all. After hosting many wild parties, Gatsby comes to know that she is married to Tom Buchanan, who is having an affair with Myrtle Wilson. Daisy's loyalty for her husband is too great for Gatsby to win over. After many tragic events involving the passing of the mysterious Jay Gatsby, Nick's life is affected in ways unimaginable by any average man. F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is truly a classic based on its page turning events that keep the reader wanting more and more. The atmosphere and environment of the 1920s is truly brought to life based on realistic occurrences. Gatsby's effort to achieve his dream is a great life lesson that can be used in the everyday lives of people: never give up on something that you desperately want. This classic novella has impacted American literature in many drastic ways, which makes it a lightning-paced story with surprises at every turn."
1821,W. Perry Hall,"Timeless American Art: An Alchemy of Truth and Beauty (and Booze)I believe the alchemy of time, place and the right talent and drive can create in an author the story and words to compose a portrait of truth and beauty that transcends time; a work of supreme art so rare and splendid that it is revered because our soul longs to be transported to the splendor of a moment in time and desires to be granted the providence to create something so divine that through it we may survive on this Earth forever.As rare and astounding as the art of Rembrandt, Renoir and Rodin, F. Scott Fitzgerald's short novel casts a spell on me in his painting Love, Truth, Mythology and Tragedy in words so poignant, eloquent and gorgeous that I, a mere mortal, cannot do them justice, so I must quote (though I typically prefer not to):“The loneliest moment in someone’s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.” ***“In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars.”***“His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips’ touch she blossomed like a flower and the incarnation was complete.” ***“And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning——So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.” ***This is my favorite American novel."
1822,Alison ☆彡,"Rating: a million stars “If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him” My heart feels so heavy... What a sad read. This book is like, always on my mind. Always. I loved it so much! Definitely beating my ex-favorite classic 1984, which I never knew was possible."
1823,Marjorie,"Why The Great Gatsby is so GreatThe book, The Great Gatsby, was a fantastic read. It had a substantial explanation of the all of the characters, which in a book like this can get confusing. There was a young man named Nick , who was a young man who lived next to a wealthy man named Jay Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby constantly threw huge parties at his overwhelmingly beautiful mansion, but no one knew where exactly his wealth came from. Mr. Gatsby also had a major crush for a beautiful young woman, Daisy Buchanan, who was in fact married to Tom Buchanan, who was a big man no one should mess with. !SPOILER ALERT! Nick helped Mr. Gatsby reunite with his former love, Daisy. Him and Daisy fell in love for a short period of time, but karma got the best of them. !SPOILER ALERT OVER! The ending is up for you to read of what happened to Mr. Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, and Nick. Mr. Gatsby did change throughout the story. In the beginning of the story he was not spoken of much, but throughout the story he became more prominent, along with his ideas and his background. The story later reveals how and why he acquired all the money that he did. A theme that was profound in the story was how the social classes actually really mattered. Nick was not as wealthy as Mr. Gatsby and Tom, but his life seemed to be in a better place in their life. For example in the story it states, “In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. ‘Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,’ he told me, ‘just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.’"" Therefore, wealthy people seem to think too highly of themselves, and they are too caught up in themselves. The wealthy do not seem as happy as Nick; they seem to have bigger more complicated problems, especially with love. Although Nick has less money, he seems to have less complications, and seems to enjoy life comfortably. Francis Scott Fitzgerald wrote the book, The Great Gatsby, in 1953. The novel was originally written by Charles Scribner back in 1925. The book is a classic that has been rewritten in different forms by different people to get different views on the book’s topic. Although the chapters are longer with only nine of them, the version written by Fitzgerald has broken up the text by using many space breaks to have the book flow more fluently. There is plenty of dialogue in the book with all of the characters, it is important to know everyone’s point of view, not just from one person’s opinion, like a narrator would be like. Fitzgerald did not have insanely creative word choice, which is helpful because there were so many different characters in the story. The overall mood is kind of in a darker sense, but it still has very captivating thoughts, that is why everyone has to get their hands on this book as soon as possible!"
1824,Aaron A,"This rating was updated after a second read (a read, I should add, that was much more insightful than the first).I'm an English teacher, and I say this not because it gives my review any extra legitimacy (it shouldn't) but because I reread this in order to teach it to my 12th grade class.And I loved it. I absolutely loved it. The characters. The settings. The colors. The... Everything.The Characters — If Jay Gatsby is not the most complex, hopeful, sad character I've ever read, then he is up near the top. Nick is mostly there to deliver the story, and the rest of the characters, while written well, seem to mostly serve to juxtapose Gatsby himself. I love him. I pity him. I want to be him. And I also really, really don't.The Settings — Oh, man. The Valley of Ashes, described for the first time in the second chapter, is so beautifully delivered to the reader that it feels as though it's a character itself, an idea that is given extra credence by the Eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg. Gatsby's parties also seem to have a life of their own.I could go on, and on (and I kind of have to, because I need to write a model literary analysis essay for my students), but frankly, you should read it and decide for yourself."
1825,Daisy Luo,"Sophisticated and brilliant. The novel is a thought- provoking observation of moral decay in society during the jazz age and casts a dark shadow on their perception of the ""American dream"". Coupled with witty poetic language, the Great Gatsby is undoubtedly amongst the greatest of American literature."
1826,Nicole,"I could lie and say that I loved this book right from the start but like I said, that would be lying. I went into Gatsby with very low expectations. On one hand, there's my friend who adores Gatsby and then on the other, there are all my friends and classmates who skipped the book and went directly to SparkNotes because they tried to read it and failed. If it weren't for the fact that I needed to read this for class, I doubt I would have picked it up.The first time I picked up this book I made it through 4 pages before falling asleep; the second time, I made it all the way to page 12. It seemed to be curing my insomnia and that was the only good thing I could say about the beginning. I found it difficult to wade through the never-ending descriptions of Gatsby, Daisy, Tom and Nick. Around chapters 4-6 my interest peaked and I couldn't put the book down. I couldn't help but hate Tom and feel sorry for Gatsby and George by the end of the book. Two men, one with a bright future and the other with a dark one, with their lights extinguished much too early. In a way they were strikingly similar so their endings were fittingly connected.Dark as it was, it struck a chord with me in a way that few of the assigned books have. It has similarities with Williams' ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" (in that desire is their ultimate undoing) and Miller's ""Death of a Salesman"" (the funerals are virtually unattended). A comparison can even be made to Brontë's ""Wuthering Heights"" if one so wishes. The death of the American Dream and the presence- or rather, the lack of it- of God are prominent players in this book.The Great Gatsby is now one of my favourite books. I can't decide what this says about me, but it sucked me in. Maybe it was the boat quote. I'm a sucker for boats."
1827,Sailor  Mercury ,"I can't express my love for this book enough. It isn't the best book ever, I can easily say- but for me, this book is simply amazing. It is not without flaw, but it touched something deep within me. The characters, the writing, the setting and plot...everything in this book just struck a cord with me. I have read it a multitude of times and do not tire of its contents. The cover, as well, is absolutely stunning. There is so much to this book that I couldn't possibly talk about all of its strengths or shortcomings within the character limit provided. All I can say is that if you read this, you won't regret it, and for a long, long time you will find yourself looking at the things in your life with changed eyes. #goshicriedsohardmultipletimes"
1828,Joshua Dykas,"The Great Gatsby is much better than The Good Gatsby, but not nearly as good as The Fantastic Gatsby."
1829,Kathleen,"As I believe is fairly common, this work was a part of the junior year English Lit curriculum at my high school, and, though not under extreme duress, I recall working my way through it as a fairly plodding, unexcited pace. Mostly, I can only conjure memories of haphazardly underlining things, half-listening to my teacher's lecture, and finding little relevance or interest in the novel hailed as Fitzgerald's magnum opus.Thus, I was a little hesitant about actually reading this one, and even considered giving my local library's classic book group a miss this month, and skipping over it. I suppose it's a good thing I didn't do that. Practically a decade later, with a few more successes, failures, and, perhaps more importantly, a better feeling for the utter contrast between the two and exactly how quickly life may transition between one or the other, reading this novel was an all-together different, fairly heart-rending and definitely affecting experience. I'm still not certain whether Fitzgerald seems to be suggesting we all leave our dreams in their sparkling, imaginary state by moving back to our safe, Midwestern hometowns or, rather, that so few will chase their ambitions to ground so ferociously that those who come as close to succeeding as Gatsby deserve our respect. I'm also not sure whether I found the sweeping, awful tragedy of Gatsby and Daisy's failed romance or the petty, commonplace cruelties suffered by everyone throughout more heart-wrenching. Still, I can assert that the raw, utterly-human quality of his characters, the poetic (dare I say jazzy?) flourishes in his language, and the strange harmony of the non-linear plot-bits all falling into place together are still casting the interesting, relevant reverberations through my mind and that in the end, I was thoroughly delighted to have reread this novel."
1830,Al Astronomo,"(I had one minor problem with this book, old sport and you will see what it is.)
And so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past, old sport.
The Great Gatsby is just... astounding, old sport. I couldn't think of a way to do this book justice in this review old sport because 1) it's already been scrutinized by the most respected authorities in literature old sport and 2) my thoughts are still all over the place, old sport.This book, contrary to what I believed at first, doesn't show much of the glitz and glamour of the Roaring 20's old sport but rather what's underneath it all: the lies, the deception, the adultery, and basically the corruption and loss of morals of Americans during this time period, old sport and the inevitable consequences their actions bring.The things that made this book amazing, old sport were the hidden messages here and there throughout the duration of the story and also the latter parts of the book, starting from the scene where Jay Gatsby and Tom Buchanan confronted each other to the ending, old sport.You might wonder (for those of you who haven't read this book yet) if there are characters you might learn to like or love. The answer isNO, old sport. The only characters who are likable enough are Gatsby and Nick Carraway, old sport, who manage to redeem themselves (to a certain degree) from their major faults in the end, old sport.However, I do believe, old sport that the characters aren't as admirable as you'd prefer because people in the Jazz Age old sport must have been like the people portrayed in the novel, which gives me another reason to love it, old sport.I did not give 5 stars to The Great Gatsby just for being a classic, old sport. I gave it 5 because it deserves it, because it's one of those rare books that possess a deeper meaning, and also because it exquisitely describes the life in a time period to the point that you actually feel like it has happened in reality, old sport.*****Over and out, old sport. x"
1831,Leo Walsh,"When first I read “The Great Gatsby” in high school I was underwhelmed. My final take at 16? Nick was a privileged prig of modest talents. He brags about how tolerant & non-judgmental he is – while telling you that that subjected him to “not a few veteran bores,” a judgement if I've ever heard one And his [not][ “whithheld” judgments go on from there. Nick judges his girlfriend Jordan as incurably dishonest, his cousin Daisy and her husband, Tom Buchanan. As careless people smash things and people up and then retreat back into their carelessness. And endless judgments about the people who drank Gatsby's booze at his stellar bashes, yet would not attend his funeral.Wow. Nick thinks he “withholds judgments?” Talk about self-deulsion. And speaking of delusions, Nick also tells you he is one of the few honest me he knows, and then leaves a trail of deceit. He hides Tom's infidelity to his wife with Myrtle. He sets up a tryst between Gatsby and Daisy. And he buys a questionable tale Gatsby tells of his life, knowing it was probably incorrect and yet “playing along.”I despised Nick as a pretentious, deceitful, self-deluding rich boy.And now, I'm over forty. And things look a lot different. I have moved from Cleveland to Los Angeles for work, leaving friends and family behind. I experienced my own isolation, especially on week ends, where everyone except me had long-term friends and family to hang with. Of course that only lasted so long. I had my church, and reached out to the “Toastmasters” and writer's groups, etc. But I do remember those first six months.Because of that experience, I see Nick in a new light. He was a lonely man, uprooted from the Midwest and planted in New York. He reached out to his only connections in New York, and they turn out an odd lot. Tom is a brutal, belligerent white supremacist who, it turns out, beats women. Daisy is a hit-house flower, pretty but not sturdy. And the girl Daisy introduces him to, Jordan, a bit too clean, crisp and jaunty to stir any deep passion.Enter Gatsby, a man who seems larger than life. He throws outrageous parties attended by impresarios, master musicians, cranks and assorted rakes. There are booze-tinged fights and booze-tinged merriment. And, because of his loneliness, Nick follows as Gatsby drags him into his wake. He listens to Gatsby as he spills his questionable tale of coming from a well-to-do family, intuiting full well that Gatsby is likely lying since Nick's first reaction on seeing Gatsby was noticing both the facade followed by a flash of the thug underneath. And then Gatsby introduces Nick to the gangster Meyer Wolfshiem, and the thug draws clearer.And yet lonely Nick still refuses to acknowledge the thug. To do so would plunge him back to reality.You see, as I grew older, Nick became a character and not only the unreliable narrator I detected in high school. Like Gatsby, Nick had his own delusions. He thought the star-like Gatsby had it all, but it turned out to be illusion. The paltry handful of people at his funeral says it all. Gatsby was a nobody buying friends. And as the “truer” story of Gatsby is revealed – son of a hapless Midwestern father whose good looks and polite comportment leads older, more powerful people to bestow favors on him – we see that he was lonely beneath the facade. A sober man detached from the frenzied mob he fed. More to the point, Nick is on the verge of discovering the truth about himself. He is lonely, has not been particularly successful, and faces the threat of a bachelor's existence. No wife, no children, a dwindling batch of friends. He had seen Gatsby's facade crumple. At the end, when he tried to hide from Tom in New York, he is so close to seeing his own cowardice and chicanery that he can touch it. Wow. What a difference experience makes. Gatsby has moved from a 3-star book (based on an immature reading) to a 5-star in my estimation. Because now I can see why critics think so highly of it. It is that good. Amazing. "
1832,Avinash,"The Great Gatsby! The Great Gatsby! It is a quest indeed. It's journey through the lives of Jay Gatsby, Daisy, Tom and the narrator. It feels awfully real and each and every instance is comparable to the happenings of real life. The way people treat each other and how love is treated, all emotions have been bundled together and we are hit against it as the emotions explode. A brilliant must read novel with beautifully crafted grammar and the metaphors are impeccable. Forewarning: It'll leave you feeling empty and longing for more and you might be roaming around like a zombie if you loved the book after the end."
1833,Sky Destrian,"8/2/15Originally I rated this 4 stars, but I just upped it to 5 stars because this is seriously my favorite book."
1834,Jason Pettus,"(The full review I wrote of this book is much longer than GoodReads' word-count limitations. Find the entire essay at the Chicago Center for Literature and Photography [cclapcenter.com].)The CCLaP 100: In which I read a hundred so-called ""classic"" books for the first time, then write reports on whether I think they deserve the labelBook #3: ""The Great Gatsby,"" by F Scott FitzgeraldThe story in a nutshell:Considered by many to be the best American novel ever written, The Great Gatsby is set in the years immediately following World War I (known as the Great War to his generation, in that World War II hadn't happened yet); it was an era known as the ""Jazz Age,"" from a term that Fitzgerald himself coined in an earlier novel, a time of great moral confusion and upheaval around the world. And in fact, that's an important thing to know going into this novel, that it is as much an examination of a period in history as it is the unique story of certain fictional characters; the main reason to read the book, in fact, is to not only follow along with the potboilerish plot on display, but to indeed understand an entire generation of Americans and how they got to the point that they did. Because the fact is that the Great War left an entire generation in numb shock after it was over; turns out that no one quite realized the kind of carnage that could be caused by adding Industrial-Age machines to organized warfare, not to mention the millions upon millions of fresh victims who could be easily shipped to the front now via modernized rail, leaving a nihilistic shell of a generation behind in its blood-soaked wake. The youth that emerged from that war were very quick to discard the Victorian/Edwardian morality and mannerisms of previous generations, simply from seeing what it got them all; instead, this generation was the first to embrace free jazz, experimental poetry, pornography and more, done through a haze of illegal booze and drugs and with none of them really expecting to live past the age of 40.It's among such a backdrop, then, that we meet a series of individuals from the Jazz Age, all of them connected in one way or another to a ritzy section of New York borough Long Island: there is Jordan, for example, the haughty pro golfer who's also a pathological liar; Daisy, a preternaturally jaded young wife and alcoholic; Tom, her blustery and frat-boyish husband; Myrtle, the swarthy mechanic's wife who Tom is having an affair with; Nick, the middle-class midwesterner everyman narrator of our tale; and a lot more, emphasizing Fitzgerald's point that such people tend to become interchangeable when met under the blurry lights of an endless series of cocktail parties. All of these people, however, hinge around the mystery man in the center, the charming and attractive Jay Gatsby (Nick's next-door neighbor, through a strange series of circumstances), who has so many rumors swirling about him that they are like an industry unto themselves: that he is a bootlegger, that he is a war profiteer, that he is a relative of the deposed Kaiser, that he was a secret agent, that he actually lives on a giant yacht that never pulls ashore.What's the real story? And why does Gatsby go to so much trouble to cloud the issue? Well, to understand that is to understand..."
1835,Ran Alzahrani,Fascinated with it ...
1836,Molly,"This book is definitely a new favorite! I read it for my AP independent reading but I've always wanted to read it. There is a movie coming out soon but shame on you if you see it before reading this American classic! This book is based off of the 20's in New York and its so amazing. Jay Gatsby is a symbolic character in which the American Dream and concept of goals are revealed. I think everyone should read this book at least once in their lifetime. By journeying through Gatsby's luxurious lifestyle through Nick Carraway's, the narrator, eyes, we see how detrimental intense wealth and success could be. This lifestyle blinds Gatsby as if his perceptions and judgments are clouded and he strives for a false salvation with his past lover, Daisy. I've learned a lot by reading this book because it opened my eyes to realize how our goals are very personal yet they shouldn't be so personal to the point where they are unrealistic. The symbols in this book, the green light, time, Doctor T.J. Eckleburg advertisement, etc all are cleverly crafted into the novel to reveal how warpes Gatsby's perspective has become. I love this era in American history so it made my experience 10x better. Its such an interesting piece that can never be underestimated for its complexity and beauty. It's definitely a lovely nocel that I would read again with no doubt."
1837,W. G. Saraband,"""The Great Gatsby"" stand as one of the greatest books of the 20th century, and the one that best epitomizes what the Jazz Age was for all who had a chance to experience it in first person. Like a Greek Tragedy, the story unfolds upward until a climax, and then the downfall of the hero just plays itself hastly before our eyes, through the perspective of a very skeptic narrator.Fitzgerald was a master in the art of prose, and the way he depicts his characters is absolutely formidable. He paints a vivid picture, where you can taste, smell and hear all that his happening, and where the gesture of each of the characters is as important as the dialogue itself.The green light, that metaphor for the extreme pursuit of the American Dream, the will to live each day as if it was the last, but which will leave you so dry that your living days may be too few.Jay Gatsby, who is either loved or hated, is just a naive fool who held to dreams that were nothing more than that. He lives in all of us, Gatsby, that side of us who just wants the best of both worlds, even though that is impossible.A perfect literary relic, ""The Great Gatsby"" is one of the best books ever written."
1838,Lottie Panebianco,"The book starts off a little slow and I wasn't quite sure what direction it was taking, but by the end I'm left with such a melancholy feeling I wanted to devour it again the minute I closed it. Yes, it has it's place as an American classic. I could feel the desperation of the American Dream in this short novel. Poor Gatsby, who dedicated his life to being good enough for a shallow girl with a magical voice when old money would never accept cheap money. His parties were so needy it was depressing. I could visualize all those moochers who feed off his wealth for a good time when they were never there to accept him and even gossiped about him in his own home. Although Fitzgerald couldn't have known at the time how the opulence of the twenties would crash into the Depression of the thirties, I could feel a warning in his display of the overindulgence, the inability to see past oneself, the complete lack of moral and social consequence. If only we could learn from the past. Not a single character in this book is likable, except for maybe Nick--who was too inactive to be too likable but I still liked his counterbalance to the overindulgence and his reality check on the American Dream--and Jordan who isn't so much likable as much as interesting. But all the characters are strong and quirky and classic. I particularly hated Tom. I was so angered with him at his last meeting with Nick that I wanted to strangle him. I wanted to see some fear or regret in him, but he couldn't see past his own nose. He couldn't see that the pain he felt was the same pain he caused. So shallow and self-involved it was almost sad. He and Daisy deserved each other. Daisy was never worth the pedestal Gatsby put her on. Since I read this in high school, I've always pictured Daisy Buchanan when I think about unrequitted love, especially love that has warped over time to be something bigger than it originally was, something unattainable and unrealistic. I hated the way Daisy used up Gatsby and then spit him out when he wasn't worth anything to her anymore. And I hated that Gatsby let her, that he put her on that pedestal and spend five years trying to be something for her instead of for himself or his family or something other than greed and childish love. Gatsby is such a great tragic character, not only because of what happens to him, but because he is so naive about the wealth and people around him. It's what makes Fitzgerald's irony and satire of the American Dream so desperate. I loved the New York Fitzgerald paints and his scarce analogy, leaving us the reader to define the novel. I loved this book in high school so much I read an anthology of F. Scott Fitzgerald's short stories (my favorite of which is Bernice Bobs Her Hair and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button). Along with Catcher in the Rye, I consider The Great Gatsby to be the Quintessential American novel and F. Scott Fitzgerald one of my favorite authors."
1839,Joaquin Garza,"	¿Por qué es tan grande el Gran Gatsby? 	En el establishment cultural de Estados Unidos, un lugar pequeño y recóndito si se le compara con el titánico mainstream del país, siempre se ha visto con muy buenos ojos cualquier obra o manifestación que critique la visión excepcionalista y triunfalista del sueño americano. Sin embargo, Fitzgerald es suave y tranquilo y su crítica es entregada con un arrobo verdaderamente literario. Si bien alguna lectura puede poner esta obra en la misma línea argumental que muchas obras de ficción o no ficción (como ‘Las uvas de la ira’ o la historia popular de Zinn), aquí cualquier viso de crítica social resulta enmascarado con maestría en una historia tan eterna como simple. Tan bien contada. Y sobretodo, una que echa mano de algunos de los que considero los trucos literarios de libro de texto para hacer una novela magistral: a)	El personaje fallido (obvio Jay Gatsby)b)	Las coincidencias extrañas que provocan una tragedia (¿Por qué le tuvo que prestar el coche?)c)	Las pasiones desesperadas, netamente humanas (Una obsesión de media vida)d)	La sociedad y el lugar comportándose casi como un personaje en sí (‘Los rugientes veinte’)e)	Un elemento icónico y una imaginería propia (El cartel del Dr. TJ Eckleburg y la luz verde)El elemento que más define a esta novela es el etílico retrato de la sociedad de los ‘Rugientes años veinte’. Para aquellos que nos ha tocado crecer en un ambiente relativamente parecido (sí, me refiero a una sociedad donde el alcohol es altamente valorado como lubricante continuo de la vida social), no puede sino resultarnos algo familiar y divertido. Como Fitzgerald era un alcohólico consumado, la novela parece destilar también un aire de estar escrita ‘bajo la influencia’. Las oraciones desgarradas y continuas en ciertos puntos parecen imitar el habla de un borracho. La riqueza que algunos considerarían obscena, los secretos familiares, los amores malhadados son eternos. Esa sociedad insulsa, superflua, cerrada y racista y ese sentido de que uno es impune para destruir una vida porque está acolchado por el poder suenan muy frescas (aunque también puedo pensar en un par de manifestaciones literarias de sociedades de exceso a una del colapso, como Les Liaisons Dangereuses). Lo verdaderamente nuevo son las flappers y el jazz. Y qué retrato resulta. La gran novela americana."
1840,Adrian Stephens,"What: The Great Gatsby is novel that tells the story of Jay Gatsby in the roaring 20s after World War I. The books explains the story of the American Dream and all the cost that it takes to reach the top. All things have a cost and sometimes it equals death. The story is placed Long Island and is narrated by Nick Caraway on of Gatsby's neighbors. So What:I read this text when I was in high school and it completely sucked me in from the first chapter because I visualized exactly what F. Scott Fitzgerald was writing. I believe that students would enjoy the book because it allows them to see a perspective of the 1920s and the themes throughout the story are so strong. The love affairs are what really keep me entertained because within them there was an underlying theme, and it makes you question the sanity of all characters. Now What:I would use this text in a high school classroom because I do not believe that students any younger would actually be able to comprehend the text in such a way needed to really connect with the text. I would connect this text with history and build up the text with World War 1 and then make my way into discussing the American Dream of the citizens of the United States. I think that this text allows teachers to be able to ask the students how they feel about the text and how the story ended and ask them to reflect on what would happen after the story ended. "
1841,Omar Avellan,"The Great Gatsby takes place during the 1920s and tell the story of Jay Gatsby who fell in love with a woman, Daisy, and he is willing to do anything to be with together. He is a very mysterious man who people made stories about. He was a war hero and a killer according to the rumors. No body really knew the truth behind his past. In a turn of events, Daisy runs over a woman whom Daisy's husband had an affair with, and people blame the fault on Gatsby since she was driving his luxurious car. From that point on, Gatsby's dream of being with Daisy gets destroyed."
1842,Peter Teagle,"I first read The Great Gatsby, like so many other Americans, in a high school English class. I approached the task begrudgingly, as I had no interest in the ""Roaring 20's"" and was arrogantly convinced I would learn nothing from Mr. Fitzgerald's magnum opus. This book is one that must be read multiple times to fully grasp the complexity of the writing. While so many people now know this work through Mr. DiCaprio's stellar performance, the book itself offers infinitely more. I will not summarize because anyone reading this review is apt to familiarity with the text, however I will say I believe it to be the single greatest American work of fiction. While the rise from the grime of poverty to the glittering of wealth is not uniquely American, the corruption of the dream is something we do, not singularly, but remarkably well. Through the glistening opulence of unchecked success we see that money, not war as Stonewall Jackson tells us, is the root of all evil. While money and success allow for the pursuing of a dream, life and our own mortality shall triumph over humanity's efforts in every instance. The true beauty of this tragedy (and it is a tragedy,not a romance) lies in the naivete of the title character. That pursuit of the dream, the loss of the dream, and the crushing burden of success assist this novel in sounding across the ages as America's greatest novel. "
1843,Nathan,"Jazz. Decadence. Alcohol. Drama. The Great Gatsby is easily Fitzgerald's finest work. I was too young to appreciate it when I read it the first time, and read it again a few years later. I'll probably read it once more before I die. Beautifully crafted, romantic in all the right ways, and somehow still relevant, even today, as a metaphor for America. Jay Gatsby is alive and well.NC"
1844,Emily Flury,"The Great Gatsby is simply a an excellent work of American fiction. I don't many people who will argue otherwise so I will not review the book itself. While I had read the book back in high school, I chose to listen to the book recently in order to get ready for the new movie. As I was listening to the book, I had the thought that the style of narration reminded me a bit of another more modern book that I had just read called The Perks of Being A Wallflower. Most everyone would agree that a major reason that The Great Gatsby is such a good novel is because of the imagery that is created and the detail that is injected into it. The words are chosen very carefully and that is what, I believe, keeps it timeless. Whereas before I perhaps couldn't specifically identify why I liked The Perks of Being A Wallflower so much, now that I see the comparison I understand now why it resonated so well with me. Perks also was filled with excellent imagery and appropriate detail, and in both novels the narrator is there to make observations as well as participate with the world around him. It will be interesting to see if Perks withstands the test of time nearly as well as The Great Gatsby has. Now for my review of the movie: the words ""a feast for the eyes"" kept going through my mind as I watched the movie. I saw the movie in 3D, which I recommend. I feel that Baz Lurhmann was a good pick as director for this film, which is based on a novel regaled for its excellent imagery, as he is known for being able to create very dramatic and over the top scenes. For example, when listening to the book, you can feel the excitement experienced by the party goers and you can practically feel the heat coming from the hotel room at the Plaza and this movie equally accomplishes those feats for the moviegoer. The actors were excellently chosen as well. The movie did not stray too much from the source material, which I can't imagine being too difficult seeing as it only took 4 hours to listen to the book. There was one scene revolving around the accident with Myrtle that was altered that bothered me. The director decided to reinterpret what put George Wilson on his path for revenge and I found it entirely unnecessary and irritating. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the movie and I will likely purchase it for my home collection."
1845,Alexis,amazing when read in high school...may need to reread
1846,Ingrid,"The glitz and the glam of this era is effortlessly described in Fitzgerald's classic novel. Being somewhat of a ""hopeless romantic"" I find myself falling in love with settings like these. Good books make you smile and sigh... great books, like Gatsby, throw you into the pages and soon you find yourself having a drink with Nick or dancing the night away at one of Gatsby's elaborate parties. Now, many of the reviews I have seen say the book has no plot or a terrible character development. I see it otherwise... For some reason I bonded with the main characters. There was something so real about Nick... He felt like an old friend by the end of the story. I of course fell in love with the tragic Gatsby and even the maniacal Tom! Jordyn even got me at times. The only character that ever bothered me was Daisy... she seems like such a ""perfect flower"" flitting around in her flowing skirts and batting her pretty doe eyes. I almost saw her as the real villain of the story! She lets Gatsby take the fall for her and runs off again with Tom.In the end I felt the story was a true representation of America. It showed a man go from rags to riches and then loose it all again. It showed the poorest of the poor, the richest of the rich and even the middle class. The Great Gatsby will and forever be a classic that I will cherish for years to come."
1847,Malinalli,"""The Great Gatzby"" by Fitzgerald was an excellent book in my opinion. It was a book that had a lot of meaning put into each and every word. At the beginning of the book we learned more about Nick, rather then Gatzby. The way the book developed was very unpredictable, and those are my favorite books. I do have to say that the ending was very abrupt. Something else I noticed was how Nick begins the book saying how much he admired Gatzby, but apart from the part in which he had just met Mr. Gatzby, he seemed to not really like him, or even really enjoy his company.Merged review:""The Great Gatsby"" by Fitzgerald was an excellent book in my opinion.

1848,Bernard Rodriguez,"Nearly everything about F. Scott Fitzgerald’s title character fills me with a melancholy sadness. His longing for the past, his life-long motivation and goal to give his love to the girl of his dreams — Jay Gatsby is a wonderful creation by an author who’s fascination with wealth and the effects it has on those who struggle to attain it were at times a mirror of his own life.Gatsy is the perfect novel. Every sentence in The Great Gatsy is a miracle. The kind of elegant, masterful prose you return to again and again.The Great Gatsby is a book I avoided for too long; I thought it was the story of a rich man living in a rich time and dying tragically amongst his rich friends. A mistake was made and an apology is in order. The story of Gatsby is increasingly the story of us all. Ambitious, longing for acceptance, dreaming big and craving a love in our life, Gatsby is the embodiment of so many American dreams. And while other novelists have explored this theme it’s Fitzgerald’s discovery of what occurs when these dreams are realized that makes Gatsby such a treat. It’s better than anyone will ever tell you."
1849,Jake Lieberman,"Fitzgerald does a wonderful job of using symbols and motifs to show what was going during the 1920s. Fitzgerald uses color, disillusionment, lights, glasses, and almost anything to symbol the American Dream and the decline of morals and social values. What I thought was extremely interesting about this book was the fact that it seems like Fitzgerald is drawing from stories and things that happened in life. This is shown because of what Jay Gatsby does to attempt to get Daisy. Fitzgerald had a problem with marrying girl in his youth because they were far too rich to marry a poor man. This theme shows up in The Great Gatsby, and Fitzgerald uses all types of literally elements to show the reading the times he was living in. "

1851,Nightsflashingby,"The Great Gatsby. The Great Fricking Gatsby. I can’t say how much I loved this book. It was so amazing, so striking and awesome, yet sad and deep but also a mystery. The characters were not necessarily likeable, but their personalities and actions were so real that they forced me to love them in some strange, twisted way. F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing in this book is so clear and easy to read, yet it draws you deep into the message of this book. The sentences are written with clear words, yet their meaning can be drawn in all sorts of different lights! The actions of the rich and their emotions and feelings, and how they seem so simple and yet are such frauds, and how a person can hold on to a pure hope! Loved, love, and will love it!"
1852,Phillip Grant,"Wow...Firstly, Fitzgerald's prose is breathtaking. It is graceful and fluent; its...naked. If that makes sense. Its not like some earlier writers (1800s), where each sentence is caked with superlatives and useless adjectives, like a beautiful girl who spoils her looks by wearing too much make-up, that it looses its power. No. His language is just perfect. His descriptions are enchanting in their perfect balance between being plain and too 'decorated'. Take this:""His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something--an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man's, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever.""The Great Gatsby might just be the best prose I've ever read.Beautiful language aside, The Great Gatsby has intriguing characters and an compelling plot. Compelling enough to read in a sitting. Fitzgerald places words in his characters mouths which uncover small, important things about each one - supporting his themes. The Gatsby provides some very rewarding close reading.When all is said and done, the aspect of this book which I most enjoyed was, as you could probably guess, the language. Definitely deserving of a 5/5."
1853,Ona,The great gatsby was a great book ! It was explores the authenticity of the American Dream while showing how social class impacts our lives. Nick Carraway who sometimes plays the narrator is a young man from Minnesota that moves to New York to educate himself about business during the Roaring 20's . Nick is neighbors to his inspiration Mr. Jay Gatsby. Nick has family nearby where he lives. He soon realizes Gatsby has close relations with them. Gatsby discovers Nick and uses him to execute his life long goal. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book. If you're going to watch the movie please read the book first! 
1854,Tanveer,Re-reading this now in my my 30s.
1855,Kukkik W,"A literary masterpiece. So much happens, so much is explained, so much is understood in a book so compactly written! Scott Fitzgerald amazes me! His talent is just... no word could ever do his talent justice! He crafts words so sophisticatedly on page, it's like magic. Actually, his writing is magic. He is magic. One of the most gifted writers in all eternity!I must confess that I only read the book because I watched the film. I loved the film so much, I HAD to read it. I am glad I did because, like in most circumstances, meaning is lost when words are turned into pictures. What really struck me was Daisy, at first I found her foolish and couldn't understand why she wouldn't be with Gatsby (I mean if I were her and a man loved me that much and built me a mansion and did all that just for me - I would be stupid to not love him, obviously! I thought it was one of the most romantic things ever) but after having read the novel, I understood why Daisy did what she did. She is far from foolish, however selfish.Everyone should read this book. It deserves all the admiration it gets. Apart from the breathtaking writing, it is an insight of the roaring 20s, and how life - even in our time - is a cocktail of chance, confusion and misunderstanding."
1856,David Hutchins,"Short classic novel that takes place in the 1920's. A young bond trader named Nick moves into a house on Long Island where he meets nouveau riche neighbor Jay Gatsby, who frequently throws lavish parties. Nick hangs out with Gatsby and finds he's in love with Daisy, a woman who lives nearby and is married to an abusive rich man named Tom. Nick finds that Gatsby isn't what he pretends to be and knew Daisy before her marriage. The whole thing comes crashing down with Nick our Greek Chorus. Very entertaining tragedy taking place among the upper crust of New York society, very well written."
1857,Faller Clementine,"Hmm. Maybe a 4.5-ish.~Okay. What to say, what to say. The challenge is almost overwhelming when describing this measly, 100-something page book.Ah, but how fitting this cover is. I'm not sure how, but it suits the aura of this novel to a G. (Not T, but G, for--(guess who?). I'm going to stop now.)At first, I was sure that I would be rating this novel a four or something like that. Gatsby=sympathetic protagonist, Gatsby-->clearly will get the girl. What more is there to it? I thought Fitzgerald was going to take the easier route (silly me. How many clues did I miss? A bazillion, most likely). He didn't, though--something that both saddens and overjoys me. I love the transition of the characters though! Very few are static (except for the women, maybe), and the development is wonderful. These are real people--ones you may have seen walking down the street. This is a breathtaking piece of work that transcends time and place (that is not something I saw myself saying even mid-way through the story, which I find interesting). There's Gatsby, of course, who goes from affluent, mysterious stranger, to flawed, visionary idealist. There's Tom, too, who goes from being an entirely unlikable character (he hits women; he's a white supremacist; he is a chronic cheater) to being one that you can, perhaps, slightly empathize with (his reaction towards Myrtle's husband, towards Myrtle death, for one thing--one much more sympathetic and caring than that of the more amiable protagonists, did slightly change my view of him). Then there's the fact that all characters in this book are so completely flawed--from the leading men to the more titular characters. Daisy Buchanan, a beautiful woman, makes several questionable decisions throughout the course of the tale, for example.Agh. I don't think I'll be able to write a review accurately depicting this story and my feelings toward it. Maybe I'll wait a while."
1858,Amy Shipley,One of my all-time favorites!
1859,Madbutmagic,"Mad But Magic YA BlogReview of Ernest Hemingway’s The Sun Also Rises and F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby: ""Jay, NA, & Hemingway""In which Sam rants about the new NA genre, raves about The Sun Also Rises and The Great Gatsby, and accuses summer of inducing the mass delusion that we are all young again.In 2009, in an effort to reach a growing cohort of YA readers over 18, St. Martin’s Press held a contest seeking fiction for a “new adult” category. Though it’s been four years since the term hit the blogosphere, I still hadn’t heard of “NA” fiction until Meg and Kate mentioned it to me a few weeks ago. After some Google sleuthing, I discovered the fabulous NA Books Blog NA Books Blog, which aptly describes the category here. I’ll give you Heather’s summary of NA in brief:NA books are the bridge between Young Adult (YA) fiction and Adult fiction. Main characters are 18 to 30 years old. Themes include leaving home, gaining independence from parents, developing sexuality, and romance, as well as making education and career choices.Heather also points out the controversy among publishers that NA isn’t “real” somehow – that there is no such category, and it’s just a marketing tool. She musters the strong evidence of NA existence from the success of contemporary NA fiction like Beautiful Disaster. I agree, but I also think that NA has been around much longer than four years, or fourteen years. I think it’s been around for at least eighty-eight.To me, New Adult fiction isn’t so much about an age – twenty-two, nineteen, twenty-seven – as about those themes of pathbreaking, discovery, and decisionmaking. But the transitions and tragedies that prompt such actions aren’t reserved for twentysomethings, and summers especially throw the subtle, slow-moving channels of change into sharp relief, and there are no two adult summers more apt than Jake and Jay’s summers in the early twentieth century.Jake Barnes, the protagonist of The Sun Also Rises, is living in Paris as an expatriate after World War I. He is helplessly, hopelessly still in love with Lady Brett Ashley (the original Manic Pixie Dream Girl?) but a wound from WWI has left him impotent. The novel follows him in sensory, intimate detail as he travels Europe and absorbs the explosive emotional affairs of his closest companions:“Never fall in love?”“Always,” said the count. “I am always in love.”Jay Gatsby, the central character in The Great Gatsby, lives on Long Island in the Roaring Twenties, a splendid shell of wealth and charm, and a churning mess of yearning beneath. He too is helplessly in love with Daisy, the old-money One That Got Away. The reader watches Jay unravel through Nick Carraway’s eyes, wonders at the whole world unraveling around him – a premonition of what was to come in 1929:“And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.”Both summers force the men to face impotency – Jake, a physical impotency, and Jay, an impotency borne of class and wealth. Neither can truly be with the women they love. But both summers (all summers?) offer the illusion of youth; the illusion of freedom; the illusion of choice.“Can’t repeat the past? … Why of course you can.”The brilliance of these two novels can’t be reduced to the changes in each man experiences, his subsequent choices, or how the summer captures the catalyst for both. Yet there is a New Adult feel to the worlds Fitzgerald and Hemingway create. Who is Jay Gatsby, really? And Lady Brett Ashley – who is she to Jake? Nick Carraway and Jake Barnes search for these answers as avidly as the readers do. Discovery defines the New Adult experience, and so I offer you these two novels as proof that perhaps we’ve always read NA novels. And – I hope – always will.“So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”Do you read New Adult fiction? What NA books have you enjoyed? Are there any novels you’ve read that you would classify now as NA? Why or why not?"

1861,فرزاد,کتابی جسورانه که با فرم یک داستان پریان شروع می شه و در نهایت با کنایه ای تلخ به همون داستان پریان به پایان می رسه.شاید بعد از خوندن این کتاب بهتر بفهمیم که چرا همینگوی اون نامه های عریض و طویل رو در ستایش فیتز جرالد نوشته.فیتز جرالد با فاصله ای نجومی بهتر از همینگویه. و تنها با یه مقایسه ی ساده می فهمیم که همینگوی تا چه حد نویسنده ای محافظه کاره. و البته برای کسانی که ادبیات آمریکایی رو دنبال می کنن این حقیقتی بدیهیه که همینگوی یکی از سنتی ترین نویسندگان اون نسل بوده. گتسبی بزرگ رو شاید بتونیم بگیم که بیانیه ای تند و تیز و مهر پایانی بررمانتیسیسم آمریکاییه. شاید اغراق آمیز نیست که بگیم هنوز بعد از یک قرن تاثیرش رو روی ملودرامای آمریکایی می بینیم. از نمایشنامه های آرتور میلر مثل مرگ دستفروش و یا نمایشنامه های تنسی ویلیامز مثل اتوبوسی به نام هوس تا رمان های فیلیپ راث.گتسبی بزرگ هنوز یکی از برجسته ترین نماینده های اون ملودرام های رئالیستی چپ گرای بعد جنگ اوله که پایه شون رو بر پایه ی فروپاشی رمانتیسیسم حاکی بر ذهنیت آمریکایی( ابا دارم از گفتن کلمه ی رویای آمریکایی دی:) بنا کردند. در پایان بد نیست یه اشاره ای هم بشه که ملودرام های اصغر فرهادی که این روزا گل کرده دقیقاً از جنس همین ملودرام ها هست.در نهایت این که اقتباسای سینمایی از روی رمان هم تا به حال همگی از دم احمقانه بودن. خلاصه این که رمانی مهم توی ادبیات آمریکا هست. حتی اگر خوشتون هم ازش نمیاد خوندنش از واجباته.
1862,Krysten,"Revisiting this: I decided to change my rating to five stars. I mean I gushed to everyone about Fitzgerald's incredible handling of language. How can I just sit here and not give it five stars? Ludicrous.***So much better as an adult than as a mystified teenager. Why do they make high schoolers read this? Redolent with heartbreaking prose. I wish I could do what Fitzgerald did so concisely. He loses me in the last chapter or two, which is why I can't claim this as one of my favorite books of all time, but if the closing parts of the book had been tighter, I'd probably go back to page one and reread this book until I die. The last few paragraphs, yes, incredible, but that's after twenty or thirty pages of meh. Oh, fuck this book, I'm glad it's around."
1863,Sarah Sassone,"This is, undoubtedly, my favorite book of all time. I get a lot of smack about this since I am an English graduate student, but there is no other favorite book. Every line is crisp. Every detail is telling. The words are beautiful and I hope to be as good as F. Scott Fitzgerald one day. "
1864,Mark Hiser,"If I was going to play the ""What is THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL game,"" I would place Gatsby at the top of my list.There are many ways to approach literature (schools of criticism). When I think about The Great Gatsby, I find a broadly drawn Marxist (or economic) reading of it to make the most sense.If I read it as a love story, I admit it is enjoyable but that there are many better-written love stories. Then, when I confront the popularity of the novel, I am called to wonder why it continues to hold fascination for Americans and why the latest film version is being presented at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival? Clearly, there must be more to this novel than a love story.I would suggest that The Great Gatsby may be one of the most important novels about the United States. Reading it, we get the sense that F. Scott Fitzgerald understood what America had become and what it was becoming. Just a few things to consider:1.	 We say we are a classless society, yet we see in this novel that the Old World class system is still with us. The book is very much about the Old Money rich and poor. Furthermore, we do not see much representation of the middle class. 2.	We say we are a socially mobile society, yet only Jay Gatz moves out of his social class. Even then, the upper class does not accept him. Tom even manipulates George into killing Gatsby, the threat.3.	We say that the American Dream is available to all people. If we but want it enough and work hard,we can have it. When we first see Gatsby, he is stretching out his arms toward the green light across the bay. He wants what it represents. In the end, he thinks he reaches that dream, but it is all an illusion. In fact, the elusive dream leads to his death.4.	Our mythology keeps us trying to achieve the Dream and keeps us believing in the Dream, yet we come to see we are rowing against the current. The Dream keeps us hopeful, but…5.	In Gatsby we see the hopes and dreams of what this country could be, but then see how that vision has been cheapened: the American Dream is about the pursuit of money. Success is about money. The promise of the land is reduced to money. We exploit the poor, rape the land, and turn it all into a dusty wasteland in our pursuit for money. 6.

1865,Angel Wu,"Definitely one of my favorite books.Taken place in the Roaring 20s (the Jazz Age), Fitzgerlad writes of Jay Gatsby, a man who defies pragmatistic ways. He tries to recapture the past and ultiamately fails to do so. Obviously, I'm not here to tell you about what book's plot is so here's a list of things that I loved bout the book.:1) The imagery. Fitzgerald was so intelligent with his diction. ESPECIALLY the expository scene. Readers immediately get a sense of the tone and theme of the book. 2) The symbolic ""eyes"" and the desert. What was Fitzgerald thinking? The enigmatic meaning of these symbols not only provokes curiosity from but elaborates into an intricate interest from me for the book. 3) Morality: the question that was raised throughout the book. HOW FAR IS TOO FAR when it comes to pursuing what YOU think is right? 4) The hollowness to the sustainable profit that the American Dream promises... the way it was presented to readers, genius!Anyways, I loved this book. I hope this review is a good enough review for you to read this book. "
1866,Nicole Cordero,"A literary element that I came across while reading F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby” is symbolism. In this book, the symbol that stood out to me the most was the green light that shined from the end of the dock “ He stretched out his arms towards the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light” (Fitzgerald 20-21). At first, I thought that by reaching for the green light meant that Gatsby was trying to reach towards something he couldn’t grasp. At the end of the book, I came to realize that it wasn’t about not reaching something “I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it” (Page 180). All this time, Jay Gatsby reaching towards the green light meant all of his dreams and hopes for his future. He knew that Daisy lived there and by trying to reach out towards the light, showed how he was trying to reach Daisy. This green light by the dock represented his hope. Daisy was his hope all along. "
1867,no one,"This book is possibly one of the most oddly entertaining, wistful books I have ever read in my life. 10/10, even if it is an odd book, I promise you read it, and you will NEVER forget about itFirst of all Overall Review This is beautiful. The thing about this dream is, it's so metaphoric you don't even realize it. It's all about the American dream and the want for money and fame and class in every way. And here these people are who have everything that all Americans want, but they aren't happy.Gatsby is the perfect example of this. He was everything a person could want, money, fame, kindness, class and an aura of scandal that leaves people thinking about him. Yet instead of this wonderful lovely man that you know he once was because of that ever so charming smile, you have the ghost a man throwing parties for utter strangers, quite completely  miserable  chasing the one thing that continued to escape him :love When Gatsby was younger, him and Daisy were so in love. But then Gatsby left for war, and Daisy, who was big money, married Tom Buchanan, who was even bigger money. Now Gatsby's back, living right down the bay from Daisy's (not-so-happy happy) little family. TOm's having an affair, Daisy simply doesn't care. So the chase commencesGatsby is rich now, possibly as rich as Daisy, but he doesn't have an actual name or please in society, but he still hopes Daisy loves him. He finally gets Daisy to say she still loves him, but he cannot get her to admit that she never loved Tom. So even if he got his wish, the love of his life, he can't ever truly get her because of her ""love"" for Tom, who is an unbearble ass, and Tom's refusal for a divorce. Gatsby wanted a love like they had in the past, but that's not possible.And then *spoiler* Daisy kills Mrs. Wilson i think and you just start to think that people never really get what they deserve. And then Gatsby dies because Mrs. Wilson's husband found out that Gatsby's car killed his wife, even though Daisy was driving. No one knows that Daisy was driving and Gatsby gets murdered cold as if though he was the one at fault. Here, you KNOW, you completely break down and understand that it's a cruel, cruel world that doesn't belief in real karma and that the universe doesn't see equality as a government does. Even Nick, the narrator, despite his honesty came from a dishonest lineage of people paying off people. Because the only sincere person in the book, Jay Gatsby, was the person who ended up dead. And another thought comes into play, did Gatsby really love Daisy? Or was he simply obsessed with the fame and money and elegance and Daisy was simply this in human form? That's something you have to decide.So the American dream as most of us believe, isn't satisfied with class or ""with enough money to have a nice car and enough whiskey to crash it."" which is most definetly a misquoted john green opinion on this book. But, the American dream can only be satisfied with one thing: happiness. "
1868,Sean Menon,"One word: Spectacular. 'The Great Gatsby' was one of the few required school recommended books I actually enjoyed. The author, Fitzgerald, is very good with characterizing all his characters and describes them quite uniquely. Not only are the author's descriptions great but, Fitzgerald also described the setting on Long Island very well. Not a single detail-including the Rolls Royce- was left out. After reading 'The Great Gatsby', it has honestly changed my life and I have decided to not only study but live in the East Hamptons (basically where the book took place). Not only was 'The Great Gatsby' a great book, but the movie has just come out. More importantly, Brooks Brothers has come out with an entire clothing collection devoted to 'The Great Gatsby'. Can't get any better than that! Oh and before I wrap up my disertation, remember that if you plan on going to watch the movie, read the book first and dress up to the theatre-full on tux and rent a Rolls if you like. The more effects the better. -$M"
1869,Cecilia,I love this book! Absolutely love it!
1870,Dennis Littrell,"Fitzgerald, F. Scott. The Great Gatsby (1925) *****The social life of the rich in the Jazz AgeGatsby was a bootlegger and a penny stock hustler. He was ""great"" only in a delusive sense. Thus the title of Fitzgerald's celebrated novel is ironic, and that is something to keep in mind when reading it.But Gatsby is seen as a step above the tony East Egg society that lived in their plush estates across the Long Island sound from his nouveau riche mansion--at least that is the revelation that narrator Nick Carraway eventually comes to as we learn from his famous line, ""They're a rotten crowd. You're worth the whole dam bunch put together.""It is ironic and proper that Daisy Buchanan, the wispy, languid and privileged beauty escapes blame for the tragedy near the end of the novel. It is her class that had always escaped blame, that had always lived on in its narrow-minded, greedy luxury. We can see their class--the Buchanans and their crowd--as Eloi-like children of the robber barons. Although Gatsby was dishonest and a criminal at least he had some gumption. And in the end we see he had some sense of integrity and courage as well.He is ""great"" then as compared to the listless, privileged people who had inherited much of the vast wealth that this young nation had accumulated during the westward expansion following the Civil War. Gatsby's failing and the failure in general of the rich was that they knew not what to do with their leisure and privilege. Gatsby threw lavish parties and affected an air of mystery while the Buchanans indulged in racist and class war philosophies while they pursued adulterous affairs and the mind-numbing qualities of drunkenness.When I first read this as a young man I thought it was a rather mediocre novel. The infidelities that so drove the story were commonplace to me at a time past mid-century, and I really missed the deep irony that Fitzgerald intended. The Great Gatsby was not ""great,"" that much was obvious; but that he was great relative to the Buchanan crowd was what I missed. He serves not only as the ""up from poverty"" character so often seen in Jazz Age and depression novels, but he is a more deeply realized character. Not a brutal man like most bootleg operatives, instead he is almost a dilettante bootlegger, yet a hugely successful one, so much so that hardly any of the details of his business now occupy him; indeed one of the reasons that I mistook his character upon a first reading is that the actual reality of the lifestyle of those who fed the speakeasies is not in the novel. Fitzgerald was more interested in the social life of the degenerates and how they looked upon social climbers like Jay Gatsby.Nick the modest narrator is in-between. An educated man of the upper middle class, a graduate of Yale, he represents the objectifying device in the novel. We see everything through his eyes and through his sensibilities. Initially in ambivalent admiration of both his cousin Daisy and Gatsby, Nick eventually becomes disillusioned with their differing but shallow lifestyles and their shallow values while he comes to realize that while Gatsby is a cut above, he is still a man with a tragically limited vision.In short, The Great Gatsby is an indictment of the Jazz Age and its easy money mentality with attendant moral corruption. Perhaps this is why it did not sell well when it was published in 1925--the jazz agers were not interested in self-portraits--but now has become a stable of American literature, and certainly Fitzgerald's most read and most celebrated novel.Fitzgerald the man may have borne witness to the excesses of the Roaring Twenties but he did not learn its lessons. He died young in Hollywood in 1940 of a heart attack, an alcoholic trying to write pot boilers for magazines and scripts for B movies. The tragedy of Jay Gatsby in some strange way may have foreshadowed the tragedy of F. Scott Fitzgerald. --a review by Dennis Littrell"
1871,Maya,"This book was very into depth. I loved how the narrator really paints the picture of what is going around ""during that time"". I really felt like I was there and it really interested me. I feel like it's somewhat similar to the movie but the book feels more fresh and it still feels like this is my first time hearing the story. My favorite part was when he describes His surroundings and really makes you feel as if you were there next to him. The dialogue is amazing. Everything flowed and I'm glad I read it! "
1872,Mindy Ledford," ""The Great Gatsby"" is a love story that is more tangled than one might imagine. The text will take the reader back to another time in history and even further back through flashbacks. There are four main characters in the text whose lives are all weaved with the ups and downs of one another. Readers can find many similarities between themselves and the characters in the text. One of the main characters is both part of the crowd and the outcast. Another main character is the envy of the town and has a hidden past. The final two main characters are married, cheaters and greedy. This text includes mobsters, affairs, intimacy love triangles, a hit and run and much more.  The thing I loved most about the book was the ending; however, not for the reasons one might think. Most texts are predictable. most readers might predict a happy or bittersweet ending - like one may find in the pages of a Nicholas Sparks book. The ending of ""The Great Gatsby"" is neither bittersweet or happy. Though this is the case, I enjoyed having my assumptions thrown out of the window. I love being surprised in a text and this one constantly did that. I enjoyed the beautiful imagery Fitzgerald gives in this text. One example is ""And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees; just as things grow fast in movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer"" (4).  I felt as if many readers from every generation can relate to this text. Gatsby spends a lot of his life just waiting for his dream to work out. Haven't we all felt like we are always waiting for our dreams to come true? In the text there are three places the characters live in and visit - West Egg, East Egg and the Valley of Ashes. The people in the text are separated by social and economic status. Half of the rich people think they are better than the other half because of how they earned or came about their money.  For teachers, this is a great book to read in class because it offers up many great places for students to hone in on their critical thinking abilities. The text is full of symbolism and is great for vocabulary practice. There are three questions listed below which would work great for critical thinking. 1. How can the eyes in the Valley of Ashes be connected to religion?2. One of the very first lines in the text is ""Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone; he told me; ' just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."" Is this kindness or pity? Can this quote be connected - reflected - any where else in the text? Are there places where a character says something to someone that can be said in kindness or pity? What's the difference?3. Is the following quote the readers first sign of the ego to follow in the text? ""I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a path finder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood."" "
1873,Naomi V,"i thought i read The Great Gastsby in high school, but obviously i didn't. otherwise, i would have read it over and over again since then. i now understand why this is a perennial favorite; the story is incredibly compelling and really well told. the language is quite amazing in some places (i've underlines whole paragraphs in places.) "
1874,Leena,What a spectacular book! 
1875,Perry Whitford,"The most revered of all American novels in many ways, I read it first when I was at college, not as part of the course but because it was hard to ignore to someone showing the early signs of a life long interest in literature. I was enraptured by it too, as many have been; the casual beauty of the prose, and the equally casual cruelty of the characters born into money.It's a novel that is about The American Dream, as all Great American Novels must be, but it's about class really, which is more of a British thing, so if this truly reflected the America of the 1930s I don't think it does now, when money is the only value, and cuts across any considerations of class from what I can tell as an outsider looking in.One scene that struck me at the time is the nonchalance with which one of the characters (the narrator I think?) forgets that it's their birthday. It seemed to sum up the carelessness of the characters so well, and it seemed like such a one-off piece of writing to me, but when I later read all of Fitzgerald's other novels he pulled the same trick again! It was in Tender is the Night I think? What's that all about?"
1876,Daniel Lammin,"An exquisitely sad and beautiful book, moving in a very unexpected way. Keeps its heart close to its chest until the last paragraph, executed perfectly."
1877,Brooke,"This novel is nothing short if it's nickname - that being The Great American Novel. The characters, though at times one-sided and seemingly flat, are in fact multifaceted in that their superficiality and gaudiness gives way to other characteristics such as sentimentality or hopeless depression. I especially hate Tom's character, though I do respect Fitzgerald's caricature of the young, rich, white male of the time. Gatsby has a special place in my heart, but otherwise...I despise all other characters. Honestly, the reader wasn't supposed to truly live Daisy, Jordan, or Tom. Even Nick was to be questioned due to his contradictory opinions of himself and others. Gatsby, seemingly a shallow new-money type, was found to be simple man whose tragic trait was his love for Daisy, who was his green light - his impossible dream. He became rich and showed off his wealth solely to find Daisy again. All Gatsby really wanted was to be borne back into that dreamlike past of his to love and be loved for the man he truly is."
1878,John Baek,"This was my second time reading this novel, and it was even better than the first time.Of course, that's probably because I first read it as a younger me, with a smaller vocabulary and less reading maturity. I had the same experience with The Lord of the Rings - I appreciated Tolkien's skill the most after the third read. Now, with a bigger vocabulary, the more I could understand The Great Gatsby and thus appreciate its literary power.For Fitzgerald is an amazing writer. Perhaps I may rank him with Dumas and Hugo as my favorite writers of all time (in my 12-year reading experience).He has quite a bit to say about human nature. I especially liked the way he ended the novel. I don't want to spoil too much for fellow bibliophiles, but the way Fitzgerald described the tension between the Buchanans and Gatsby was so evocative, I could just see it happening. (I keep seeing Toby Maguire instead of the nebulous Nick Carraway, DiCaprio instead of Gatsby, etc.)The illustrations of the extravagant parties are perfect. The illustration of the great Gatsby's particular character -- i.e. the way he smiled, with his pink suit -- is perfect. The entire structure of Fitzgerald's syntax and semantics just glistens with an inner beauty and... It's ineffable. The dialogue between the characters is so rife with desire, anger, sadness. A sense of wonder at the purely wild nature of America permeates the novel, in particular, the party scenes. I can see now why some critics lauded this novel as the ""great American classic,"" or something of the sort.I would recommend this novel for anyone who appreciates wonderful style. Fitzgerald's diction is expansive, also, including some words that even I didn't know.The Great Gatsby is a prototype of the American dream and its consequences."
1879,Augustine  of Elsinore,"Fitzgerald's subtle lyricism as well as his need for pragmatism and his unavoidably romantic disposition produced a great classic novel; a novel about capitalism, the roaring twenties, young businessmen and women who cannot live without fancy dresses and champagne glasses tchin-tchinning. He gave us a clear and definite picture of another era; an older era not so much different from ours, after all. Scott Fitzgerald created Gatsby and Daisy to talk about the tragic aspects of love and passion in the consuming 20th century, while always discussing and criticizing the lifestyle of upper classes. Gracefully written and magically plotted, a novel that everyone has to read at least once. "
1880,Ashley,timeless.
1881,Rhys Thomas,"A fine book. I read lots of this book on the lawns of the Cardiff War Memorial Gardens. There is much awesomeness in the book, and two moments of extreme violence, one of which is particularly grim. "
1882,Cirtnecce,"I finally finished reading The Great Gatsby and my first reaction is – why the hell did I wait so long to read this magnificent work??? Why the hell did I believe that this very stereotypical tale would be written in same trite manner set in an era and country that in itself continues to make people curious and on this lay the principle reasons for popularity of the book alone? I was so wrong!!I think one of the main reasons which made me hesitant to pick up this book was the fact that at a very young and a very impressionable age, I had read Tender is the Night and really dislike it. Somewhere in my sub-conscience, I knew that as a connoisseur of literature, I should give this book a try and in fact had borrowed it from the library at least twice and bought a copy more than year ago…but until today, I just did not summon the courage to read it. But now that I have, I must own, I am blown away. I am humbled and in complete awe of the immense talent of Scott Fitzgerald that he could take an oft repeated tale and turn it into something beautiful, tragic and a cathartic experience. I am sure almost everyone is familiar with the story of The Great Gatsby. The story is told from the point of view of Nick Carraway, an educated, wealthy and a sincere Mid-Western, and begins with his moving to East, New York to work for Bonds. He is soon re-acquaints himself with Buchanans, Daisy being his second cousin and Tom being his senior at college. The Buchanans are typical products of the Jazz Era, with loads of money and restlessness. They had travelled in Europe, lived in Chicago, before moving to New York. At the very onset of the novel, it is made evident that Tom Buchanan is a libertine and keeps a mistress, Myrtle Wilson, who is the wife of the garage owner, Gorge Wilson, with who services, Tom Buchanan’s car. Nick also becomes friendly with the mysterious Jay Gatsby, his extremely wealthy neighbor, who throws lavish parties, through which events he behaves extremely gentlemanly. Nick soon discovers a past between Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan and soon this past comes to become the present of the lives of the two, with tragic results that Nick sees through, after which he moves back to the West.What makes this book wonderful is the word portrayals and characterization. For instance when Nick first describes Gatsby “If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the ""creative temperament""--it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.” Through the book, while Gatsby and Daisy are the principle figures, the author also subtly delineates the character of Nick Carraway, who is presented as a contrast to all the denizens of East, with his sincerity and true sophistication that comes through. It is Nick Carraway’s own admission that comes as a proof of his honesty of character “I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life”. Fitzgerald is at his best as he masterfully creates verbal imageries and brings home to the reader the irony of the tale, with a gentle disapproval of his generation and their conduct. His description of George Wilson and Tom Buchanan making similar discoveries about their wives is presented with an illuminating insight “I realized that so far his suspicions hadn't alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world and the shock had made him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before--and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well. In fact the book is filled with such piercing observation - Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead”. I know I have quoted practically the complete book, but the very beauty of the book lies in the words – used so subtly, yet so powerfully as to make one speechless and instead quote forth the book. In the end, all I can say is, this is a must read and I am only sorry that I made my acquaintance with this masterpiece, so many years later! The preface, (which I always read after reading the novel, since they create bake ideas that intrude into the tale) describes how on its first publication, the book was deemed a failure and only after it was distributed to the soldiers during World War II that it began to rise in popularity! I am once again amazed how a worthy work, gains all the value, when it is deemed completely value less."
1883,Gabrielle Kur,"Just finished re-reading this and it was just as good, if not better than the first time. Fitzgerald has an enchanting way of writing. Can't wait to read it again a few years down the road. "
1884,Adam,"The Great Gatsby may be one of the best novels ever written and certainly the best one i've read. It follows the life of Nick Caraway and how his life changed when he met Jay Gatsby. Gatsby is a mysterious, rich man who throws parties hopping that one day he will be reunited with the love of his life Daisy. Jay Gatsby is living the american dream, the novel illustrates the discrepancies between fact and fiction of the american dream. I think the novel is part love story part drama, but no matter how you classify it you will be intrigued by Mr.Gatsby as the novel pulls the reader in to learn more about his exciting life. I would highly recommend this book to anyone no matter what genre you prefer Gatsby is a book for everyone. "
1885,Ninagrace 411,"I first read this in high school and of course I hated it, like everybody else. But after the amazing new movie came out and I had a better idea of what it was supposed to look like I decided to give it a second chance. I'm so glad I did. I don't think I'm making any waves when I call this a work of genius. I don't think this book should be taught in high school though. Teachers choose it because it's short and full of literary devices that they are trying to teach. But the true meanings behind the book, social inequality, longing to return to the past, unmet desires, what do high schoolers really know about these?"
1886,Lovey,I have read this multiple times and will continue to read it!
1887,Robin,"So I reread The Great Gatsby. For those of you who don't know me very well, no, it's not because of the Baz Luhrmann movie adaptation that just came out. For those of you who know me a little too well, yes, it's because of the essay Murakami just wrote about finishing his Japanese translation (also, STOP READING MY DIARY!). I really liked it this time through, and I feel like I actually got something out of it. I finished it on the T this morning, then put my earbuds in and immediately had ""A Day In The Life"" come up on shuffle. Thus, everyone on their way to work via the greenline was treated to my stoic, manly, I-am-not-so-sad-right-now face. Reading The Great Gatsby for yourself when you're in your twenties and reading it when you're sixteen for a class are very different experiences. The first time through I thought Nick was present only to worship Gatsby and provide a convenient way to narrate his story. This time, I saw how his views on Gatsby evolved throughout the course of the novel, but were never entirely positive. He treats him with a sarcastic detachment until his flaws begin to surface, at which point he begins to treat him with a sort of knowing, older brotherly care. In the end, Nick is the only person in the book who really learns anything, as is evidenced by the way he chooses to end his relationship with Jordan like an adult rather than leaving lingering doubts like he did with whoever it was he had left in the West before the novel's start. This relationship is likely linked to the empathy he feels towards Gatsby, but I will always have to wonder how. Perhaps Nick was Daisy in his first relationship, and led the girl to believe he would marry her when he ultimately could not. This could be why he found it impossible to tell Jordan he loved her when they went out driving together: he felt he still needed to give her an explanation before moving on with his life. This being true, he was probably looking for some sort of redemption by helping Gatsby overcome the sorrows he knew he had given to another. Or, maybe he was in the same situation as Gatsby, and a woman he loved had been married to another without giving him a proper explanation. He holds out hope for her coming around, but decides to leave the area so be might be done with the affair altogether. He would then have been trying to help Gatsby get out of a situation he knew all too well. This would explain the novel's opening lines, and the quote from his father about not assuming things of people, for they may not have had the same opportunities he had. Nick was self aware enough to find a way out, Gatsby was not, and it killed him."
1888,Katy,"Ahh, so much better than I remembered it from high school!When rereading it now I really felt like that 1920s culture of wealth and excess is still applicable today. Makes you wonder if we've come full circle? Or would any reader find those themes familiar in their time period?I only hope Leo and Tobey can do it justice..."
1889,Arlen,Read it (many times) and now listening to it while reading Maureen Corrigan's excellent dissertation on it. (Now We read On: How the Great Gatsby Came to Be and Why it Endures.) Can't get enough of it.
1890,Yosr Mbarek,simply amazing
1891,Sam," ADVICE: DON'T READ JAKE REINVENTED BEFORE READING THIS BOOK  ps this first section is a rant feel free to skip it an go on to the actual review partLet me just start this review off with the fact I had unknowingly read a modernized version of the book: Jake Reinvented. So as I was reading the Great Gatsby, I thought to my self hmmm this book sounds awfully familiar. After having an epiphany (don't say I'm miss using the word because God actually came down and told me this) that Jake Reinvented was the same story! So first thing I thought was  that bastard Gordon Korman (after looking the name of the author on google and then posting my thoughts on facebook, I mean this is the modern age). So a few moments afterwards someone commented on my status that it was intentionally a modernized version. So then I thought those bastards of english teachers, making us read a book and not telling us that IT WOULD INCITE RUINING THE GREAT GATSBY! grrrr (haha jk my english teacher is prob my best friend :/)  Summary This book is just over all amazing, probably one of my favorites. In a nut shell: it's narrated seamlessly by Nick who is a middle class gentleman working in the bond business. He lives next door to Mr. Gatsby, who throws luxurious parties. Nick is also old acquaintances with Tom and Daisy, who have quite the unhappy marriage. It seems Daisy has a mysterious connection in her past to Mr. Gatsby. And so the plot thickens... I definitely would recommend this book to anyone who has a great appreciation for amazing literature. THE ACTUAL REVIEW PARTOkay so you made it to the review part hooray. Now for some serious substance!First off I thought that the Great Gatsby was so beautifully written! I feel I have to mention this because it was so unexpected, normally (or at least in my experiences) most books past the era of Austen/Dickens don't have the beautiful rhythmic flow of words that becomes slightly poetic. But the diction was so beautiful in this book it just pulled me right in. Furthermore, the narrative was utterly unique to anything I have ever read, the story is basically told through Nick, but its about Jay Gatsby. Good job lost generation, got some good writing skills!Secondly, the novel is very dated but at the same time it isn't dated at all. AND THAT'S WHY I LOVE IT! I have to admit I am not only a literature enthusiast but I am also a history enthusiast  some people call it being a nerd, others call it obsessed, some dare to call it narcotic but I prefer the term enthusiast  Historical elements that I loved This book is set in America in the 1920's, a world that had just gotten out of a war and an era of deep culture. The book takes on the setting in a beautiful way and manages to capture it perfectly. It shows the wealthy class in this period and the snobbery between old and new money. The book captures the youth in America and the extravagant parties. Also, it shows the common fraud at the time and the businesses (i.e. selling bonds). Probably my favorite part was the fact it took place in NEW YORK! I am probably one of the most ethnocentric people you'll ever meet because I live and love New York! I love that it gives us this great perception of New York; between the details of the scenery, the names of the cars and just daily activity throughout New York (I WAS IN LOVE). Also here is a touch of black humor for the cynical. While reading this book I kept thinking, fast forward ten years and you all will loose your money in the stock market crash. Ha there should've been a sequel called: Great Gatsby II: when the depression hits (not the best title I know, don't kill me I'm not a publisher nor an author). The Great Gatsby's Great Timeless Themes  (see what I did there? a little alliteration to soothe the mind)*Disclaimer: this is solely my own analysis of the book's themes and are certainly open to interpretation The Great Gatsby is historical but it also includes themes to it that have surpassed time's limits. This book explores the American dream. Essentially what we all strive for: to be rich, have a beautiful husband/wife and just be all around popular (for lack of better words). And let's be honest with ourselves this hasn't changed from time period to time period. It's the job of the rich to try to stay rich, the job of the middle class to become rich and the job of the poor to move up in society, if they have any hope left (paraphrasing George Orwell there). This poses the question that although it's our dreams, is it really what will make us happy? It also explores the ideas of dying alone and true friends. Of course these cheesy themes are deeply imbedded into the story, so it doesn't sound so corny when you read the book. Oh and if I sound like a teenage school girl in this review, guilty. I'm a sophomore honors student. "
1892,Tajah,"The complicated dynamic of desiring when one already has had so much, and the ephemeral jubilance it brings prior to fate revealing it's ugly head by snatching it all away, is depicted perfectly in Fitzgerald's classic novel. He conveys the wealthy in a superficial, almost comical manner; their ignorance is shadowed only by their incredible abilities to allure the most common of outsiders. Tom's mistress from the dingiest part of town and the obnoxious hues to vibrant colors in Gatsby's party reiterate how the wealthy are capable of being dragged to a common folks level. The ignorance of Daisy and her superficial demeanor dispel any notions of a kind, loving mother; her child is rarely mentioned and her willingness to ignore Tom's affair show the mentality of rich, white women which continues to the current year. "
1893,Gary,"The Great Gatsby.....what makes it great?? You ask?Spoilers involved here.....Fair warning.....I believe it's great because the story is told from a different character's perspective of Gatsby,and Daisy,and all the other characters...Nick is the narrator....and what a great narrator he is....I think the book wouldn't have been nearly as effective, if Jay himself, told the story, or Daisy, or Tom, or even Jordan....Nick had a completely unbias opinion,and perspective that the other characters wouldn't have had if they had told the story....I also believe it's great because of the ""raw"" human emotions depicted in this story....yes, it's set in the 1920's , a time of indulging in oneself.....a time of blatant celebrating, but the story is so much more.....it is a story of true feelings,and trying to be true to yourself, which is what Jay and Daisy were trying to do, but then again, were they???? Maybe Fitzgerald is questioning that is this novel, and then things spin out of control..... Daisy has a horrible accident, with the mistress of her husband,and then the situation seemed to make Daisy and Tom closer, and maybe Daisy realized how much she truly loved Tom,and how they can be happy together only if they try.It is real people going through real feelings of alienation, sadness, in a loveless marriage , due to it being convenient, being unfulfilled in their lives....and the intertwining of those lives,and how they truly affected each other in ways none of them felt could ever be possible.....Maybe the whole situation is Fitzgerald trying to make head and tails out of his own situation with his wife,and that he stuck with her because he truly loved her,and it was not easy because of her mental health issues...... but worth it because he truly cared for his wife.....It makes me think about how you truly are responsible for your actions,and how it does affect others, with what you do. I think F. Scott Fitzgerald was trying desperately to find the happiness he so desired in the novel, because he was in a situation in his personal life, that certainly was not easy for him. The drinking became his crutch....but maybe the writing of his novel was his therapy in dealing with his every day life.I also think it's a story , that tells us, that life goes on,and being the star of the show with incessant partying,and such, is not the be all end all to happiness that it appears to be.....At least you can say that Jay and Daisy both are at peace in the solution of the novel,and that Daisy may be truly happy for the first time in her life....Tom too. Even Jordan is engaged to be married, and yet, the narrator, Nick, what happens to him in the end??? We are left hanging on that issue....maybe if written today, Fitzgerald would have written a sequel, telling us the further adventures of Nick....The time of publication.....if this is what Fitzgerald intended, which I believe he did, he had to use ""code"" and innuendo to get his point across,and ""tread lightly"" in how he told the story of the characters, Nick, in particular.Plus I believe this masterpiece, wholly depends on Fitzgerald's crafty way of packing a ""huge punch"" into such a small, pages wise, novel. The more I read it the more fascinated I become. How can a truly literate person, not love the prose,and the ""slick"" way ole F.Scott tells this rich story.....?????? I am writing this at 1:30 am. I can't sleep thinking about this story.... I am reading this novel for the 2nd time in the past week, in anticipation of the movie being released on May 10th,and I have read it many times before. I still am amazed how much more I get from the readings I have done,and I have to admit, I don't read many books more then once, but this one keeps drawing me in, again,and again. I am looking forward to see how the new movie treats the novel......if you have not experienced this book....you need to....and also Fitzgerald's short stories....."
1894,Kate,"The Great Gatsby seeks to uncover the story of the mysterious Mr. Gatsby, a wealthy man living next to the protagonist on West Egg, just outside of New York City. The main character, Nick Carraway, seeks to create a new life for himself and with his parents help, moves to West Egg and goes into the bond business. One day, he is invited to a party at Mr. Gatsby's house, his rich neighbor who likes to throw parties. While there, Nick meets many prominent people in New York's society, but stumbles upon his host towards the end of the party. After a conversation with Mr. Gatsby, Nick becomes curious about Mr. Gatsby's past and sets out to learn about it. Nick discovers that there is something going on with his cousin, Daisy, and Mr. Gatsby. The mess of connections and trouble only escalates from there. I enjoyed reading this book about the tangled social life of high society. F. Scott Fitzgerald did an excellent job of writing the character of Mr. Gatsby, making him intriguing, but at times forgettable and normal. On every page there was a new connection that shed light on one relationship and made another infinitely more complicated. Nick Carraway was an impartial narrator, only serving to tell the story and direct it, not often putting in his opinion. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good summer read. "
1895,Nat Storing,"I think it was a wonderful book, I loved the style of Fitzgerald's writing, I liked the humor of it at times and who he got right into the story almost immediately rather than leading up to the good parts. Gatsby, there's a lot of interesting things about this man. He was arrogant, a bit of an asshole at times, he was flamboyant at times, he was charming, wonderful but also not who he says he was exactly. I loved his character and kind of disliked his character all at the same time. There were times when I thought he was a complete idiot and other times when I felt bad for him.Daisy. Daisy was someone who I barely liked, she seemed flightly, carefree, not all there in the head and simple-minded I suppose. She loved Gatsby at one time, she loved him and wanted to be with him from what I got from reading the book but she came from a somewhat wealthy and well to do family, she wanted to start her life and so after Gatsby had left for his duty in the army she waited for a while but then started to see other men before marrying Tom. I feel like a lot of Gatsby's pain was caused by her, by the fact she was unwilling to wait for a man that she claimed to love simply because he had to take his orders in the army. I fell like she was groomed to be a wife, which at the time this was written in may be true and maybe that is why I feel annoyance with her character. I was also appalled and angry that when Gatsby had been killed that she didn't even bother to show up at his funeral and that she hadn't even sent one word. if she had ever cared for that man one bit she would have tried to send word to Nick at the least you would think. Tom, ugh. Just, I hate Tom. I hate his personality, his character, how he seemed so full of himself, how he treated his wife, how he cheated on his wife constantly and everything about him. I hate him so much, he is the cause of Gatsby's death and so, I hate him. Nick, I liked him. He saw Gatsby for what he was I think. He saw that he was a real person, that he wasn't just this arrogant and flamboyant man with money who threw numerous grand parties all through the week. I feel as if he was one of the few people who had seen the human side to Gatsby rather than just the side that Gatsby let people see. He knew that Gatsby wasn't the best of people, that he wasn't a truly good person but he also wasn't a completely bad person either. I think, in my opinion, that Nick saw things as they were. He saw people. I loved the book all the way up until the ending, I could not believe that Gatsby had died in such a way, that he had been shot for killing Wilson's wife, something which had technically not even been his fault. Daisy was the one who was driving but never told anyone. He died because of Tom telling Wilson whose car it was that had killed his wife, it was Tom who had killed Gatsby in my opinion. Even though he was barely in the book and barely mentioned I felt horrible for Gatsby's father who seemed so proud of him, who seemed to love him so much and thought the world of the man.And the funeral. God, all those people who had come and been invited to Gatsby's parties and not one single one other than Nick came to Gatsby's funeral. Well, they are complete dimwits and I just feel as if they at least owed it to Gatsby to come to the funeral. I think that was another thing that i hated about the book, one of the few things I hated about it. But otherwise, I loved the book, it's amazing and lovely and I am planning on reading it again already and will probably move on to reading his other works as well. My favorite line in the book : Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning-- So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."
1896,Bernhard Lermann,"The Great Gatsby war der letzte Roman von F. Scott Fitzgerald, bevor der Beginn der Weltwirtschaftskrise im Jahre 1929 den Roaring Twenties ein Ende setzte. So gesehen spielt die Geschichte schon fast im Mittelalter. Der gerade gefochtene Krieg, aus dem Gatsby mit vielerleih Orden behängt, zurückkehrt, um sich auf die Suche nach einer Frau zu machen, von der er im Schützengraben liegend dachte, dass er sie liebe, wurde noch mit Bajonetten auf den Gewehren geführt. Die Dekandenz der Zeit, mit der Fitzgerald beruflich wie privat in Berührung kam, fasst er hier in schimmernden Bildern zusammen, für die wohl wenige Autoren neben ihm eine so reiche Sprache gefunden haben. Genau wie der Soziopath James Bond, so wird auch die Figur Jay Gatsby heute in der öffentlichen Wahrnehmung auf die rauschenden Feste, den Champagner, die maßgeschneiderten Hemden und Anzüge, über die eine Frau wie seine Geliebte Daisy Tränen der Begeisterung vergießen kann, und auf die Posen reduziert. Der einsame Bachelor steht spät abends auf dem gepflegten Grün vor seinem riesigen Anwesen und schaut auf ein Licht auf der anderen Seite der Bucht, wo die Frau seiner Träume von ihrem Ehemann hinter hohen Mauern gefangen gehalten wird. Und Gatsby lockt beide an, indem er alle Lichter in seinem noch größeren Haus entzündet, was ihm neben unzähligen Motten und Flapper auch irgendwann seine Daisy über die Schwelle trägt. Fitzgerald nimmt sich seine Generation hier richtig vor. Am Morgen der Party bleiben sie alle gleich müde auf den Stufen vor dem Palast liegen, tränen- oder blutverschmiert. “They were careless people, ... they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.”"
1897,Stefano Ottolenghi,È possibile dare 6 stelle?
1898,Therese Thompson,"Thanks to friend Michelle for putting a copy of one of American literature's best novels in my hands for another look. I have been trying to read classics I may have missed and revisit some favorites and The Great Gatsby was time well-spent. Truly some of the most poetic writing in the English language and some of the most indelible characters to live in book form and the imagination. If you have not read this since high school or college, revisit it with a mature eye and it is so much more heart-breaking. "
1899,Natalie,"I read part of The Great Gatsby in high school... but the implications and the subtlety was lost on a 15-year-old girl more interested in basketball tryouts and which color of Aeropostale sweatshirt she should buy. I almost reread it in college, as a literature minor, but French medieval lit and modern Norwegian lit were too interesting and Gatsby again gathered dust on the shelf after 3 or 4 chapters. And then finally, the movie was coming out. I had to finish it.And so, armed with my iphone's sparknotes app and highlighter, I set in. I gave the short book the long time it deserved, referencing back to the ""themes, symbols & motifs"" section in the sparknotes app, researching new york at the time, and even reading a couple wikipedia pages on Fitzgerald himself. And that's where this book truly shines.The beauty of this book is not in its story, but in its depth. The prose of Hemingway is beautiful, and the imagery and symbolism is so extensive that books 5 times gatsby's size have been written on it. Also hindsight is 20/20 - and somehow the fact that we now know what awaited the stars of Gatsby less than 10 years in the future (The Great Depression) makes the morality tale of the emptiness of all the excess and extravagance that much more potent. It's an incredible book."
1900,Wendy,"I read for the first time freshman year of collage. Love this story. While it is heart breaking and tragic, it is still one of my favorites. "
1901,Mitchel Broussard,"Told from the point of view of an outsider of the finer things in life (despite his wealthy upbringing), The Great Gatsby was a surprisingly easy and... dare I say it about a required school reading novel... enjoyable.Given the fact that my preconceptions about the book were just that it was ""that book about jazz-era socialites"" (which I'm pretty sure is how everyone views it who hasn't read it), my enjoyment of it definitely surprised me. It's basically a who's-sleeping-with-who-these-days scandal story, but all the characters seemed so blase about everyone's tumbles-in-the-hay, it felt almost refreshing. Despite it being over half a century old.The narrator, Nick, moves into a little bungalow in the shadow of a mountainous mansion, owned by a man named Gatsby, on Long Island, New York. The entire novel follows the proceeding events of one summer, from Nick and Gatsby's first meet, their budding friendship, and everyone elses dirty secrets coming to light.Gatsby hosts these extravagant parties, but only does it so Daisy (Nick's second cousin once removed) will come over, because he fell in love with her ten years ago, but he had to go to war and now she's married. Her husband, Tom, is having an affair with some mechanic's wife back in the city. At the same time, Nick falls into a superficial relationship with Daisy's pro-golfer friend Jordan. After a while, Daisy rekindles her love with Gatsby and properly begins her own affair.Like I previously mentioned, my favorite part about the book was the jadedness most of the characters have towards adultery. Very early on Jordan mentions Tom's mistress to Nick as if she's discussing in boring detail her last loss on the golf course. And even after Tom and Daisy discover the other's secrets (I have a feeling they do very earlier on than is actually brought to light in the story) they act as if it was going to happen anyway. Well Tom freaks out a little, but Gatsby sort of goads him on.Overall, definitely one of my favorite had-to-reads I've come across."
1902,Christy Clements,Amazing...just as I remembered it. One of my all-time favorites!
1903,☯Emily ,"I can't believe I never read this in High School or any other time. I was blown away by the pathos of Gatsby and the unfeeling behavior of Daisy and her husband. While the book was easy to read, it wasn't cursory description of the times Fitzgerald lived and partied in. He accurately portrayed the high society of which he was a part. The behaviors and attitudes in his time are much the same as today's. "
1904,AverageTessa,The Bae across the bay.
1905,matt," I reread this once while sitting on the porch in my family's summer home in the hot afternoon by the pages and storyline piling up...I finished it and an started writing little snippets of poetic phrases in the back pages as the giant waves came crashing and roaring up over the heads and bodies of my family as they waddled around on the beach or standing querulously knee-deep in the water. I remember being inexplicably moved by that. It felt right, somehow. Fitting and sad. ....Rereading it now, critically, for an academic essay I'm working on I'm struck less by Gatsby's love or the milieu as I am Fitzgerald's precision and concision as a writer. Not usually attributes associated with him, but I think extremely warranted.  I'm much less taken with the glamour of the bunch, and Gatsby seems less dynamic and more a one-note piano. Daisy is much more vapid than I had initially noticed, which probably says more about me than it does about FSF. Tom Buchanan is more of a roaring brute than I remembered, and Nick is a little more urbane and ironic than I'd noticed, as well. I guess what I'm saying is that Fitzgerald's technique is what interests me more than anything, especially the writing which is NOT as ornately poetic as all that.  I have heard it said that Fitzgerald's best writing was in revision, and he was tireless at it. This is a very encouraging and cool thing to hear about the kind of figure we all pretty much know him to be. I think it shines through in several places, notably the extremely tense and awkward hotel scene where Gatsby and Tom fight through barbaric, muted, overly genteel terms over the right to Daisy's heart and, um, 'bud'. It's much more awkward, socially stagnant, than I remembered, too. There are scenes with much more tension than I'd ever noticed before. The orgies are in abatement. Though, of course, they are what are to be talked about, especially since polite company would dare not speak of such things."
1906,Helynne,"The Great Gatsby is beautifully written. Its style is eloquent, and incredibly perceptive and wise, especially considering how relatively young Fitzgerald was (29) when he wrote it and the fact that the author was very much a part of the over-the-top Jazz Age milieu, the very society he was critiquing, at the time the book was published (1925). The themes of The Great Gatsby resonate with an immortal wisdom even as they vividly pinpoint a specific class of very rich—and often morally bankrupt—people in 1922 New York. Despite all of these selling points, I sometimes wonder why The Great Gatsby has been for decades a staple in high school English classes. Look what the plot contains: two different couples committing adultery, domestic violence (at one point, Tom hits Myrtle and breaks her nose), constant, excessive (and illegal) consumption of alcohol, Gatsby’s meteoric rise to fabulous wealth though criminal means (first bootlegging, then the sale of bad bonds) within about four years, and all the shallow values and hedonistic behavior that are rampant at Gatsby’s many lavish parties. I know Fitzgerald’s prose and themes mostly outweigh these concerns. Through first-person narrator Nick Carraway, the author speculates that the determination to manipulate our lives and circumstances too drastically or in too unnatural a fashion is doomed to fail. Gatsby was a North Dakota kid from the humblest beginnings who was determined to make something of himself. He changed his name and left home as a teenager to work for and be mentored by a wealthy yachtsman. Gatsby and Daisy fell in love in her native Louisville where he was stationed in the Army just before he shipped off to Europe for service in World War I. He lost Daisy to Tom Buchanan while he was away (although there are hints that Daisy never stopped loving Gatsby). Nick muses at the melancholic end of the novel, “I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city . . . ” Much is made of the symbolism of the green light at the end of the East Egg dock that borders the Buchanan mansion, because, after all, Gatsby’s ill-gotten gains all have been to win Daisy back. Much is made also of the painted eye glasses on an old billboard near the garage where Myrtle’s husband works. The faded oculist ad rises over the ash heaps in this poor section of Long Island between the elite East and West Egg areas and the city as a kind of all-seeing deity reminding readers that destiny is never in the hands of anyone who thinks he is control of his life. (Directors of all the film versions of the book give the eye glasses a lot of camera time, which, in my opinion, is heavy-handed and kind of creepy). It is to Nick’s great credit that he remains Gatsby’s best and only friend up to, during, and after the end, and that he recognizes Daisy and Tom for who they really are. “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy, --they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made. ... “ Although Nick came from a rich family in Minnesota and was educated at Yale, he realizes at the story’s end that he is no match for New York society, and he heads home, having discerned that, somewhat like Gatsby, he has tried to fit into a niche to that is not desirable and to which he is not suited. Referring to Gatsby’s “extraordinary gift of hope” and “romantic readiness as such I have never found in any other person,” Nick speculates, “ Gastby turned out all right at the end. It was what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporary closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and the short-winded elations of men.” The eloquence of Fitzgerald’s prose as he indicts the shoddiness of his own generation is courageous and timeless. "
1907,Alastair,"Presumably there's another book here - an entirely different book, perhaps even a better book - for those who want to read further into the broader metaphors and class issues. Personally, I found it perfectly satisfying at face value.Fitzgerald had an amazing knack for writing with both beauty and economy. The tiniest sentence and character gesture can carry so much implied information. It was often quite thrilling to pick up on those extra details, accessible only to those who pay attention, as if deciphering a code hidden in plain sight.While I was far more in love with the storytelling, the story itself is modest and ultimately pays off very well, particularly when Nick Carraway, a blank slate of a narrator, finally develops a personality of his own.I started this review with a level-headed four stars, but the amazing final page and the (uncomfortably relatable) ""I'm thirty"" line have caught me in a moment of weakness. It's 2am. This book has left me wide awake, thinking of the future. A reaction that powerful can't be sold short."
1908,Eric Aiello,"Let's suppose for a minute that I hated this story (I didn't)... what would my rating be then? Still five stars. This book contained some of the most fantastic prose I've ever read before. And for that reason, this book deserves, in my opinion, those five stars.But, alas, I didn't hate this story. I loved it. The collapsed American dream, a commentary on wealth, a violent love triangle, and a single voice of reason - the narrator - who ends this book with profound observations."
1909,Barry Walsh,"I read The Great Gatsby most summers. It's a holiday event that never disappoints. While Gatsby may not be the best novel ever written, I think it's the best short one. And, proportionally, it contains more beautiful sentences and passages than any of the longer ‘greats’.One day I’ll read it in New York. Who wouldn’t want to after: “I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone’s away. There’s something very sensuous about it — overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.”Fitzgerald's famous final paragraphs are chromed genius. However, equally affecting are the times when the surface of the reservoir of mainly implied emotion (Tom Buchanan's rational narration keeps the lid on most of the time) is broken by small, heartbreaking bubbles.Like when Gatsby is told that he can’t repeat the past with Daisy and he replies, “Can’t repeat the past?… Why of course you can.” It makes you want to cheer.And when, for last time, Tom sees his driven, flawed, and marvellous neighbour in whom ""No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart"" and says, “They’re a rotten crowd... You’re worth the whole damn bunch together.” It makes you want to cry.Guess I’m a fan."
1910,Tanya Marie,"I absolutely loved this book and can say with confidence that it is my favourite book of all time. Fitzgerald captures a sparkling, magnificent and alluring world of glamour and money that as a reader, I immediately fell in love with. The materialism of the era is employed by Fitzgerald to form the basis for a romance that some will argue is superficial, but one that I will argue is timeless. Gatsby's love for Daisy is so intense that it touches your heart with every page and it's not even painted for us by the man himself. I can only imagine how much more heart wrenching the novel would've been had Fitzgerald used Gatsby's voice the whole way through. But the glimmers of his voice that we are given, are so sincere and drenched with infatuation that I couldn't help but sympathise with Gatsby the whole way through.Fitzgerald has the special quality of not only writing with eloquence (possibly as a product of his time and personal background) but also writing in a way that forces you to align yourself with the novel's characters. I can feel Nick's adoration of Gatsby and I can feel that Gatsby is besotted with a girl who doesn't love him and now and probably never did. It made me hate Daisy incredible amounts and I still do - to the point where I'm referring to her as if she is a real person. Haha. But there isn't one thing I dislike about this book. It's one of those books that I could honestly read over and over again and never get bored of. Reviewed by: Tanya Marie"
1911,Megan Walden,"As the twenties rage on, so does the drama. In F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby, he tells a story of tragically crossed lovers. These lovers are the center of attention in this beautifully written story. The main characters are as followed: Tom Buchannan and his wife Daisy Buchannan, Nick Caraway the narrator, Jordan Baker girlfriend of Nick, Myrtle Wilson mistress of Tom, and J. Gatsby the Great. The story beings with Nick telling the audience that he is the author of the book. He begins to tell of how he arrived in New York and his blood relation to Daisy. He is then taken through many twist and turns. He meets Tom’s mistress, attends Gatsby’s famous parties, learns of the mysterious and goal driven Gatsby, and falls in love with Jordan Baker. Through many tragic and unfortunate events, Nick’s life is changed forever. The Great Gatsby was beautifully written and still stands as one of America’s greatest books. Fitzgerald tells of the roaring twenties. And roaring they were! Through the intimacy and partying, however, Gatsby’s American Dream slips through his fingers. Even though it was very tragic, it still provided many life lessons and themes that anyone could learn from. This classical novella is just that: a classic."
1912,Angela Yang,Brilliant.
1913,Margie,"I initially gave this novel four stars but upon reflection I felt compelled to increase my rating. Mainly because I can't stop thinking about it.Sometimes you read a novel and think, ""That was really good."" Then you move on to thoughts of what's for dinner. And then there are those novels you finish and immediately seek out other commentaries and opinions, not only because you're interested in what others thought, but because you just aren't ready to let go of the experience. For me, Gatsby falls into the latter category.The writing is superb. Fitzgerald has a way of describing a thing that is spot on. For instance, he describes Gatsby's smile as follows:""He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to face--the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.""I love that!The Great Gatsby is a hauntingly beautiful novel. It is the story of a seemingly strong, but ultimately sad man who sacrifices himself for a woman who, even if she weren't terribly flawed, could never live up to his highly idealized expectations. I plan to read Gatsby again soon, and probably often. "
1914,Eric England,"I decided to reread The Great Gatsby due to the imminent release of the new feature film starring Leonardo Dicaprio and Carey Mulligan. This is my third time reading this book. However, I probably got more out of this reread than the previous two times I perused this poetic tome. While the book is stunningly well-written, it can seem slight or even superficial on the surface level. A tawdry soap opera plot glided with sublime imagery. However, this is only an illusion. The Great Gatsby is truly a study of the dark heart of the materialistic side of the American Dream. It is an examination of the 1% (for lack of a more catchy and concise term) and how they play, like fickle Greek gods, with the lives of the lowly 99%. Jay Gatsby and Myrtle Wilson are clay shaped and destroyed by the willful actions of the despicable and narcissistic Tom and Daisy Buchanan. Nick Carraway, the one character in the pathway between the rich and the poor, observes the destruction in a voyeuristic but ultimately heroic fashion. In the end he rejects the corruption of his deity-like class and leaves in exile. Nick is determined to live a life away from the casual sociopaths living amidst the rich and beautiful. The Great Gatsby is a dark, beautiful, and brilliant novel. "
1915,Kaitlyn Saliba,"Had to read this in high school, and I thought it was just another dreadfully boring book that was made into a school assignment - WRONG!Turned out to be my favorite book of all time."
1916,John Blasko,"This is the third time that I've read The Great Gatsby, and it is the first time I have really appreciated it. I seem to read it in different ways at different times in my life. I also tend to read things quickly. I consciously slowed myself down while reading this book and noticed a few things:There are some amazingly beautiful passages in this book. I loved the way that Fitzgerald shaped phrases. There are incredibly rich moments. It is almost like prose poetry. I never would have noticed it had I not slowed myself down.It struck me as odd how my relationships with the characters changed throughout the book. When I think about it, they are all very one-dimensional, but I go back and forth between loving and hating them; Gatsby in particular. I find myself sometimes rooting for him and sometimes reviling him. The next time I read it, I may feel differently.I know there are other things that I made note of, but I cannot think of them now. However, I know that I am going to continually reflect on the writing and story. This was the first reading of The Great Gatsby that truly affected me. I plan on reading it again."
1917,molly,"Gatsby is one of those characters that has dogged most Americans through most of their reading lives. At this point, can I even write a review? Like writing a review of the American Dream itself, that overaffectionate lumbering beast, or of my eighth grade English teacher whose breath smelled like onions and who choked up during the ""boats borne ceaselessly back into the past"" line, to the endless bemusement of her preteen students. Which version of ""The Great Gatsby,"" exactly, am I rating? I found myself remembering where I was and what I was doing the first time I read a line, or the last time, and simply have too much of myself in this book to possibly be objective."
1918,Shauna,"Goodness. This is way better now than it was 20 years ago, in high school! So gorgeously sad. "
1919,Miguel,"I think I've mentioned this in other reviews, but I always feel odd ""reviewing"" literary classics. It's like, come on, does this book really need my seal of approval? Does anyone really give a ""care"" about what I think of a canonized and immortalized work of art? So maybe that's why when I review a ""classic"" it reads more like a journal entry than an actual review.In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald touches on a number of tropes that are frequently explored in high school classrooms such as the legitimacy of the American dream, economic stratification, and societal norms of the 1920s. But really what The Great Gatsby leaves its readers with is a profound melancholy, especially if they're over thirty, that their best is behind them. The ethereal visions and dreams of our forgone past loves and accomplishments float farther away as we try to frantically swim closer to them. American society itself is presented a degrading middle aged country without imagination that worships at the alter of capitalism and semi-monarchal familial reputations trapped in a cycle of womb envy.Fitzgerald paints a stark contrast between the painfully normal Nick Carraway, an aimless and listless product of the status quo, and Jay Gatsby's Byronic archetype who tries to fit into a world he can never fully understand. And why should he even try to understand such a broken and disingenuous system? Jay Gatsby unintentionally parodies the society's predilections with his lavish lifestyle and wild parties both meant to ultimately impress his lost love. Between Gatsby and Daisy Jay or Buchanan, the reader can only assume that two people so beautiful, genuine, and innocent being united would be far too much for the degenerating Long Island Hedonists to bear.So is The Great Gatsby worth reading? Don't ask me. "
1920,Ryan,"I have managed to avoid The Great Gatsby since I was sixteen, even though it has been on the reading list at every high school I have ever taught at. It was also the only book that I only read once during my high school years, which brings the next statement as little surprise: I hated it sooooo much, as much as anything could be hated from the core of a 16-year-old's being.I think that I was a typical idealizing teen, anxious to label things and place them according to easily understood dichotomies. Having things agree to be right/wrong, white/black, night/day, bad/good, fascist/totalitarian brings comfort to most people, especially teens that have not had a chance to see or participate in all of the greys the world has to offer.The one area that I could not or would not divide into two distinct camps applied to books and literature. I hesitated greatly to stomp on other people's opinions and sentiments when applied to writing, whether it was their own or in what they read. Writing, I guess, has always been something that has not come easily to me and I appreciated anyone who could get published and read, even from my teen years. [The irony is that now, older and more willing to accept the greys (hair and otherwise) I am also more willing to call some books junk.] The best I could do was say that I did not understand something, or deferred judgment on what made literature good to someone else, more studied, more well-read, perhaps more refined..Read the rest at: http://www.subproximus.ca/blogs/perso..."
1921,Pei Ni,"The novel, The Great Gatsby was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. His purpose in writing this story is to show the readers that materialistic things cannot provide the happiness that true love can. For Gatsby, he believed that throwing extravagant parties, and being wealthy could make him happy, but he was wrong. Gatsby was not satisfied because he did not have the same love returned to him. Gatsby loved Daisy unconditionally and provided her with everything she could ever ask for, but she broke his heart by marrying Tom. Gatsby never gave up on Daisy because he loved her. The theme of The Great Gatsby is love. Gatsby longs for Daisy because he loves her, right? Or is it a deception of love? The only woman he has ever given his heart to has left him for someone else and he is heartbroken. He attempts to win her over, but their affairs do not last long. Gatsby has not taken chances to love someone new. He thinks of Daisy as this precious gem that he does not want to let go of. Any person in their right mind can sense that a girl like Daisy won’t give up her put together life for him. He is deceived and in love with the dream of Daisy, a fantasy he refuses to let go.  The authors style is a narration. He is also very descriptive. He writes in third person narrative and uses lots of imagery. Fitzgerald tells the story through a chronological order. He sets up the story by explaining Gatsby’s life before wealth and how he became the famous man he is. Then he goes on and explains how the story unfolds and presents the problem and solution of his journey of love and destruction. This style is effective because the reader can understand Fitzgerald’s intention. I think this is a fantastic book that anyone should read. There are plot twists that leave you at the edge of your seat. This novel is vivid and lively. I absolutely enjoyed reading this. "
1922,Anita,"I recently reread this book, having not read it since junior year of high school. I seemed to have forgotten a lot about it, and did not truly appreciate what a great storyteller Fitzgerald was. The glamour of the Jazz Age and the wealthy extravagant lifestyle of Jay Gatsby is contrasted by his mysterious past and a barely tangible sadness within him. This is a beautifully written book, and it is quite obvious why it is a classic. The narrator, Nick Carraway, tells the story of Gatsby and paints him as both a hero and a tragic figure. Of course the root of the tragedy is his love for an unavailable, and in my opinion undeserving woman, Nick's cousin Daisy Buchanan. In this story, as is typical in many similar scenarios, this love proves to be his undoing. The real element that sets this apart from an average star crossed love story though, is the excellent narration and the way that Fitzgerald creates both compassion and mild contempt for the attitudes of the central characters which is of course a common side effect of fabulous wealth and privelege. He also creates an out for them- please forgive them, they are rich and they don't know any better. "
1923,Monty J Heying,"[possible spoilers]Half love story and half social critique, The Great Gatsby is a snapshot view of America's ""Jazz Age"" depicting urban corruption in the Roaring Twenties through the first-person narration of a young upper/middle-class mid-westerner and almost-veteran of WWI, Nick Carraway. Nick has come East to ""learn the bond business"" and gets swept into the drama and intrigue of his uber-wealthy next-door neighbor Jay Gatsby. Gatsby is a former lover of Carraway's cousin Daisy, wife of the even more wealthy polo-playing Tom Buchanan, Nick's former Yale classmate.Other major characters include a gas station manager, George Wilson, and his wife Myrtle, who's having an affair with Daisy's unfaithful Tom. The plot thickens.Gatsby is a self-described war hero who has amassed a fast (three years in the making) and secretive bootlegger fortune through his relationship with Wolfsheim, a major crime figure responsible for the fixing the 1919 World Series.The Buchanans own a posh estate that includes stables with a string of polo ponies. The beautiful dim-witted Daisy tolerates with great discomfort Tom's not-so-secret infidelity with Myrtle, and Tom takes Nick into his confidence, flaunting the affair in an intimate private party.The intrigue deepens when Gatsby befriends Nick and reveals his former connection with and continued desire for Daisy, enlisting Nick to facilitate a reunion rendezvous. The intrigue grows to explosive proportions with tragic consequences.The characters tend to be two-dimensional because of the limitation of first-person narration. Nick has limited access to the thoughts and inner motivations of the other characters. However, liberties are taken with the limitations of that point-of-view when Nick confides imaginative intimate background details of Gatsby and Daisy, supplying hints of their character and motivations. What distinguishes a fable from a literary masterpiece is length and character depth. This is almost a fable. In a novel we become emotionally engaged through intimate knowledge of essential character-shaping details. In Gatsby, the only one we know in significant depth is Carraway, through his inner musings. It is Nick's story.Nick's transformation and our intimate knowledge of him makes Nick the main character, with Gatsby as the hero who takes the risks, causes the central conflict and makes things happen.Daisy and Tom are shown as uncaring snobs, but we don't know what made them this way. We have to make assumptions that they were raised spoiled and overprotected and with limited exposure beyond their social stratum. It's an assumption Fitzgerald forces us to make by not supplying much background.Nick is transformed from naive and accepting to skeptical, disillusioned and untrusting of the wealthy Buchanans, including Daisy's golfer friend Jordan Baker. Nick is the imaginative lens through which all that happens is viewed. What he sees, feels and judges controls the readers' perception, therefore Nick's transformation is shared by the reader. Nick's awakening from naivete seems to be the point of the novel--to awaken readers to their naivete about corruption in society, including at the highest levels.In the end Carraway concludes that Gatsby is ""worth the whole bunch of them"" (meaning, we assume, the Buchanans, Baker, the Wilsons and Wolfshiem) because of his heroic pursuit of a dream to overcome his modest origins and become wealthy, with Daisy's love as the symbolic trophy acknowledging his achievement. Fitzgerald had five major thematic balls to juggle: romance, corrupt ambition, class distinction, Jazz Age and Eastern sophistication vs Western naivete. The link between romance, corrupt ambition and class distinction is timeless and without border. The Jazz Age and East v West are unique to America. To fully understand the characters one must understand America. Fitzgerald took it for granted the reader understood certain terms like ""Midwest"" and references to the Dutch pioneers who founded New York as New Amsterdam. He was writing primarily for an American readership. The ""Jazz Age,"" or the Roaring Twenties, was a significant period in our history, representative of the excesses of unbridled capitalism and greed. It is the period leading up the stock market crash of 1929, a cycle that has repeated itself in the '80s S&L Crisis, the '90s Energy Crisis, the '02 Dot-com boom and bust and most recently in the Sub-prime Mortgage Collapse of 2008.In a broader context, The Great Gatsby stands out as a prime candidate for The Great American Novel. There is a Faustian irony to Jay Gatsby in that he ""sold his soul"" (corrupted himself) in order to gain Daisy's love or win her as a trophy signifying acceptance by the social elite. His corruption made her--the object of his greatest desire--unattainable, and he paid for his corruption with his life.Steinbeck's novels are also in contention for the Great American Novel, but in an agrarian setting. Two films were made of East of Eden, three of Of Mice and Men. Films were made of The Grapes of Wrath, Viva Zapata, Cannery Row, Sweet Thursday and Lifeboat. A film of In Dubious Battle is in the works. How many authors have honored to this extent (ten films) by the film industry? Also the theater, especially OMM. I suspect Steinbeck has more characters imbeded in American psyche than any other American author.Nevertheless, The Great Gatsby stands out because of its throbbing echo of classic American optimism in the grip of the relentless corrupting force of capitalism gone wild, so evident today in the Citizens United decision, the hyper-concentration of wealth and the ever-tightening grip of the ""KOCHtopus"" on our lives. The Great Gatsby screams relevancy by spotlighting runaway capitalism as it was headed over a cliff in the Crash of 1929. The love triangle is a potent delivery mechanism for the subtext of social critique. Fitzgerald was every bit as critical of capitalism as Steinbeck, but the satire is so subtle that some readers won't get it.ADDENDUM 6/19/15:As narrator, Nick Carraway is like a filtered lens; what HE sees and the way he sees it shape the readers' perception. Or perhaps DE-ception. Everyone has a public persona and a private one that darker-Jay Gatsby included.Everyone has blind spots. Nick is no exception, and the things he doesn't pay much attention speak volumes about who Jay Gatsby really is. And therein lies a deeper meaning to this quintessential novel about America. It is a satire of capitalism, not a tribute to it.Everything Gatsby says should be open to question because he's lied about so much: his name, his family history, his initial shading of the truth about being ""an Oxford man,"" his ""old sport"" affectation. Dark rumors about Gatsby's background and the owl-eyed man's exposure of the library of impressive new books that haven't been read were the first clues of a facade. Gatsby's low character is revealed when he dated Daisy five years earlier, exploiting her, allowing her to believe he was from a family financially on par with hers to seduce her. Nick overlooks all of this. But shouldn't an objective reader be more circumspect?Remember the scene in Gatsby's new yellow car on the way to town where he's grooming Nick to exploit his family relationship with Daisy? He shows a photo that could have been faked; he says he's from old inherited wealth; then he avows to be a war hero and pulls a frat boy trick flashing a war medal anyone could have bought at a pawn shop and had engraved.And yet Nick bubbles over with admiration, enamored perhaps, and never attempts to corroborate what Gatsby says, when a reasonable man would have checked Gatsby out before exposing a family member to possible risk.Readers should have been tipped-off about Nick's lack of reliability in all things Gatsby by the near worshipful way he describes him from page one. And yet so many of us swallowed Nick's tainted view until the very end. There was no corroboration of Gatsby's accusation that Daisy was behind the wheel, and yet we take the word of a confirmed liar and con artist because it supports Nick's biased vision of Gatsby as a hero. For an unbiased reader, the missing corroboration infers that Gatsby is lying about Daisy being the driver.Fitzgerald could have had a witness corroborate a woman was driving the death car. He chose not to. With a mere few lines Fitzgerald could have had Daisy thank Gatsby for taking the fall for her. He chose not to. How are we to interpret this deafening silence on the author's part except as a clue that Gatsby was lying about Daisy driving to polish his hero image for Nick?That Gatsby is obsessed with Daisy as a trophy signifying his rite of passage into the cream of society was made clear in the climactic hotel scene in sweltering heat. But Nick, along with many readers, misinterprets Gatsby's passion as love. In the same scene, Daisy comes out of her trance and rejects Gatsby, earning sympathy for Gatsby in Nick's mind and taking the reader along with him. But shouldn't this be the moment for readers to come out of their trance as well?Why do so many readers accept the word of Gatsby the con man? Because we see him through the warped vision of Nick, who's been swept away, more so even than Gatsby's legion of party-goers. ""He threw dust in your eyes just like he did Daisy,"" Tom Buchanan said.If an essential part of Nick's role as narrator is that of a foil, to set readers up for being fooled so that we can wake up at the end to the destructive superficiality and false promises inherent in capitalistic greed, he has succeeded, at least for some of us.""Gatsby? What Gatsby?"" encapsulates this entire book.If Gatsby symbolizes the ""American Dream,"" the seductive allure of capitalism, Nick can represent the masses who are seduced by the inflated promise of wealth and opportunity and the clouded vision inherent in the corruption of the run-up to the Great Depression. Nick is a foil because he makes Gatsby appear heroic with adulatory descriptions while ""tarnishing"" his own image by confessing a homosexual tryst with McKee. Nick skews the reader's perception of Gatsby, suppressing and disregarding his character defects, causing the reader to overlook them. Because Gatsby is seen only through Nick, the reader gets seduced by the hero's ostentation, his rags-to-riches trappings of materialistic success--the American Dream come true.Yet America's history is littered with tainted fortunes: Ivan Boesky (insider trading), Michael Milken (junk-bond king), Charles Keating (S&L Crisis), Kenneth Lay (Enron), Bernard Madoff (securities fraud) ... . How many readers were infatuated with Gatsby, ""carried away"" by Nick Carraway?Part of Nick's role as an unreliable narrator is to present the reader an amplified polished interpretation of Gatsby so the seemingly heroic character would personify the seduction often lurking beneath the veneer of materialistic success--a pattern that keeps repeating.“So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”ADDENDUM 6/26/15:For those who refuse to accept that Gatsby lied about Daisy being behind the wheel, here's compelling evidence that he lied at the top of page 159 in my 180-page paperback edition.The grief-stricken George Wilson is speaking to Michaelis around 3AM, the morning after Myrtle was killed.(For context, the citation begins at the bottom of page 158.)Wilson: '""He murdered her.""""It was an accident, George.""Wilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior ""Hm!""""I know,"" he said definitely, ""I'm one of these trusting fellows and I don't think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know it. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he wouldn't stop."" [Not SHE wouldn't stop; HE wouldn't stop.]Michaelis had seen this too, but it hadn't occurred to him that there was any special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had been running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any particular car.'Here in omniscient third-person mode, first-person narrator Nick is delivering the testimony of two eye-witnesses that a man was driving at the time of the accident. There was no mention of a woman even being present in the car, let alone at the wheel. We have the word of a confirmed liar and con artist Gatsby, who's trying to polish his hero image with Nick, a bond-salesman whom he has twice tried to recruit into his counterfeit bond scheme, against two reputable eye-witnesses who have nothing to gain by lying.Two honest men against a confirmed liar and con artist who's been trying to con Nick into joining his scam. What does it take to convince you guys Gatsby was lying about Daisy being behind the wheel?"
1924,Stefanie,"Nick Carraway is one of my favorite narrators, and his friendly, insider view is perfect for a book where everyone else seems untrustworthy, shaded in their intentions. Fitzgerald's filmic descriptions are extraordinary; his/Carraway's writing adds depth and emotion to what, on the surface, is a simple and almost silly plot."
1925,Tenderine,"Ok, ""GG"" comes second after ""Tender..."". I'm not very fond of Nick Carraway, his character is way too passive and melancholic and what not. I'd preferred him to be more gay like Jay Gatsby, for example. I'm so in love with his love story and that is before the END (you know what I'm talking about, I couldnt possibly like what happens then). The way he cares for only Daisy through years even though she betrayed him (and she so did), the way she's the reason why he's become the mysterious Gatsby. I'm enchanted with this character. "
1926,Nancy Herkness,"I appreciated this book so much more now that I am, ahem, more mature. The insight into human nature is extraordinary. The descriptive language is so vivid. Fitzgerald's understanding of the power of having a dream made me cry. Beautiful."
1927,Ruth A secas,"Solamente puedo definir la pluma de Fitzgerald como exquisita, ha sabido presentarnos la época perfectamente, como eran los jóvenes los cuales tenían todo a sus pies, así como las fiestas, también nos narra todo lo que hacemos por amor, a todo lo que dejamos por el camino y todo lo que hacemos para poder estar con nuestro gran amor. También vemos de primera mano lo que son los celos.Sin duda alguna Jay tiene mi corazón que hombre tan asombroso.En definitiva este libro es una auténtica OBRA MAESTRA, así con mayúsculas.Y se va directamente a la lista de mis libros favoritos del 2015, por libros como esta me encanta leer."
1928,Adrian Bonilla,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a book about a young man who moved to Long Island to experience the bond business. He also visits his cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom Buchanan which is Nick's friend from Yale. While visiting Nick meets a friend of Daisy's named Jordan Baker and she tells him about Mr. Gatsby and Nick tells her he's his neighbor and Baker later tells him Tom has another woman in New York. One issue which is not the biggest but it's also one to think about is how Tom has another woman in New York. This other woman is ruining Toms relationship with Daisy because Daisy already suspects of this if not she already knows. At one point Nick met this other woman of faint curiosity, and she's also important with the story. Since the book is technically a love story I'll compare it with other similar novels. The first is The Fault In Our Stars because it's a book of a strong bond between a perfect couple in their own imperfect world with an unexpected twist ending. The second is Gatsby's Girl which is a biographical novel about F. Scott Fitzgerald's first love and how she coincidentally correlates with most of the characters in his books most notably as Daisy in The Great Gatsby. The book really affected me because it's a really transfixing but sort of cliche like story. Reading on I felt this weird feeling of Déjà vu probably because I've seen the movie or because I actually did read the same story but in other books. It really shocked me because the climax impacted very hard and in a very new and original way. By the end of the book I finally saw the puzzle and how every character fit in. All in all, while I'm not a big fan of romantic novels I liked what this one brought up. This book can also get real confusing at times with all the big vocabulary words"
1929,Eric Dirker,"There are few books that I can read over and over again, yet still have a fresh experience every time...This is one."
1930,Ranita Raha,"It is the Roaring Twenties, and people are losing themselves to the lure of money,and the only person who remains unaffected is Jay Gatsby, the enigmatic host to flamboyant parties.""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”"
1931,Breeana,"I really loved reading this book. Though the story seemed unlike the ones I normally enjoy. The characters were of a class I do not relate to ,except for Gatsby who I actually admired and was intrigued by. I completely understand dreaming and 'faking'your way to a life you want and Gatsby had a big impression to make. I didn't see what he saw in Daisy in my own words 'she's a snotty bitch' but I don't own a penis and I wasn't there. We have all fallen trap to liking someone who was all shiny and empty.The writing was beautiful , I may read this one twice. "
1932,Christopher Roberts,"About halfway through this book I thought it was going to end up in that list of ""great novels"" that I found to be extremely underwhelming. I was wrong. The seemingly simple story is very intricately woven. Every detail earlier in the novel, no matter how unimportant it may seem, feeds into the greater narrative. I thought of the characters as largely amoral and vacuous for a while and some of them are, but the revelations about Gatsby and the ending of the story is quietly devastating. This is a book that lives up to the hype. "
1933,Ozy ,"If I know something about myself, it is the fact that I'm delighted by the ambiance some books bring to my life - The Great Gatsby was not an exception! I felt the characters so shallow in a terrible way, yet the book made me go deep into thinking about this world and the people living here. I love it! I have a special kind of respect for Gatsby in a way that I can't describe. This book spoke to me; I felt every single page and even if I can see a lot o people not liking it, I'm still going to let the substance of this world touch me in every way I can. "
1934,Julia Becker,"The Great GatsbyAuthor: F Scott Fitzgerald Pages: 180Genre: Fiction Reading Level: 8.1 Exposition: Nick Caraway graduate from Yale and fought in World War 1. He decides to move to New York to learn about the bond business. Nick moves to West Egg, Long Island where he rented a house. Jays house is right next door to Nick. Tom and Daisy Buchanan live in East Egg. Daisy is Nick's cousin. They invite Nick to Dinner where he meets a woman golfer names Jordan Baker. When Tom and Daisy leave the room Jordan informs Nick that his prostitute was calling him.Conflict: The conflict is being in love with someone who is already married. Jay Gatsby falls in love with Daisy only finding out that he has to go off to war. He goes off to war and write Daisy a letter saying he isn't rich. She is shocked and moves on to another man who has money. Jay returns from the war and wants to try to win Daisy back. He is successful because he sees her a few times but never marries her. Climax: The climax of the book is when Jay and Daisy are driving back from New York City. Jay lets Daisy drive to let off a little steam when she was upset. She ends up hitting Tom's prostitute with the car, so Jay tells Daisy to keep driving. People think that Tom did it because he was driving the car on the way to the city. Resolution: Tom clears everything up and says he wasn't driving the car. Jay is accused of the accident but before he could clear his name the prostitues husband shots him. Then the husband shots him self too. They both die. At the funeral Nick is the only one who shows up and calls Daisy's house. The man who answered the phone said they went out of town and wont be back for a while. They leave their house as if nothing ever happened.Theme: I am compering The Great Gatsby and The Perks Of Being A Wallflower. They are similar because both stories are about love, regret, and getting through obstacles together. They are different because they are set in different time periods so the way they act might be different. Another way they are different is that how they fell in love and how they expressed it. The endings were different because one pair ended up together and the other split. I have learned that there is a lot of regret in life. It is hard to fix things that have already happened. I learned that no everything come easy in life."
1935,Terra Maslak,"Before I read the book, I watched the movie and fell in love with it. I love everything about the 1920s and the way that Fitzgerald portrays that decade is perfect. I love all of his vivid descriptions of the places, and parties, and music, and events. This book is one I love immensely."
1936,Vale,"Si è scritto tantissimo su questo romanzo e a ragione, perché davvero risulta difficile non esprimere un parere, come se le nostre parole potessero dilatare i tempi della storia, permettendoci così un addio più lieve. La voce narrante di Nick Carraway è uno dei migliori esperimenti letterari di sdoppiamento della realtà, il suo punto di vista rappresenta, a mio parere, l' ""epifania"" più lunga mai scritta. Egli protegge il lettore dalla sordida aridità della società, lo tiene con sè dalla sua parte, gli sussurra le sue inquietudini rispetto ad un mondo in cui si sente la nota dissonante. Nick come gli occhi del dottor T. J. Eckleburg , è colui che vede, colui capace di andare oltre gli eventi e di comprendere i limiti umani di ciascuno. La sua voce narrante a tratti ci fa uscire dalla storia, si riposa nella natura o nella semplice contemplazione delle vite che gli scorrono accanto, in questo è una epifania: si isola dal mondo per pochi momenti e in modo così completo da farci apparire le cose più comuni come insolite, svelandone così la loro essenza. Le persone sono come oggetti e in quanto tali le tratta Carraway, più che giudicare cerca di comprendere: ci sono uomini sbadati, incapaci di sentire e di vedere, per i quali una luce verde al di là di un molo sarà solo un avvertimento per i marinai."
1937,Cedric Brachet,The book starts off when Nick moving to a house in West egg islands. Every weekend he sees that Jay Gatsby throws extravagant parties. He goes and meets his cousin Daisy and her husband Tom. While visiting with them he meets a beautiful girl named Jordan. He falls in love with her and they start a relationship. Later in the summer Nick gets invited to one of Gatsby's parties. When Nick finds out that Gatsby is in love with his cousin Daisy he tries to set them up. In my opinion the book starts off very slow but grows better and better. I like this book because there is a lot of action but also a lot of romance. I would recommend this book too people higher reading levels and high schoolers. Also I would recommend it to people who love action and romance books.
1938,Francesco Scarlata,"“Se tu non mi ami, ti amerò io per tutti e due.” Questa frase non è di Scott Fitzgerald, è di Hemingway, suo grande amico, conosciuto durante il soggiorno a Parigi negli anni ’20. Fitzgerald aveva appena pubblicato “Il Grande Gatsby”, romanzo accolto molto bene dalla critica e poco dal grande pubblico.“A volte è più difficile privarsi di un dolore che di un piacere.” Quest’altra è di Fitzgerald invece, ma non appartiene al “Grande Gatsby”: proviene da “Tenera è la notte”, altro clamoroso fiasco commerciale, scritto e riscritto mentre Zelda, la moglie di Scott, era rinchiusa in una casa di cura perché malata di schizofrenia. Perché ho scelto di fare una recensione citando due frasi che non appartengono al libro in questione? Non saprei di preciso, forse ci sono più motivi. Innanzi tutto mi sembra che siano collegate fra loro, e oserei dire che sono pure interscambiabili; immaginate un dialogo fra due persone: secondo me, sia che si cominci con una sia che si cominci con l’altra, entrambe si cercano, entrambe trovano il loro completamento l’una nell’altra. Sono due frasi che mi piacciono perché appartengono a due scrittori del XX secolo il cui lavoro non può essere valutato senza tenere conto della vita che essi hanno vissuto. E la vicenda di Jay Gatsby non è che la parafrasi della vita di Scott, innamorato perso di una donna che una mente lucida non tarderebbe a definire “sbagliata”: Zelda era frivola, gelosa del lavoro del marito, capricciosa, desiderosa di vivere quella vita che Jay Gatsby costruì attorno a sé per riconquistare Daisy: una vita di inutile quanto intrigante sfarzo, di allegre orchestre, di feste chiassose, di fiumi di champagne... di un’apparenza consapevole destinata ad un finale tragico. Non fate come me. Guardate il film con Robert Redford solo dopo aver letto il libro. Guardatelo però, e osservate gli occhi di Mia Farrow: brillano sempre, dall’inizio alla fine, brillano di gioia e tristezza insieme... ma brillano, preservano la conquistata ricchezza della superficialità, e credo siano l’immagine più appropriata con cui ricordare la serena e sottile perfezione del romanzo: tutto il libro è pervaso di luce, talvolta più chiara, talvolta più scura, in ogni caso dall’intensità doverosamente bilanciata. Chissà se la luce degli occhi di Mia Farrow fu la stessa che Scott vide negli occhi di Zelda, quando la incontrò la prima volta. Chissà se gli occhi di Zelda brillavano ancora mentre tradiva Scott con un aviatore francese. Di certo Scott continuò ad amarla “per tutti e due”, così come aveva continuato ad amarla quando, all’inizio della loro storia, lei ruppe il fidanzamento perché il primo romanzo “Di qua dal paradiso” era stato rifiutato. Come avrebbe potuto Zelda sposare uno squattrinato aspirante scrittore ex soldato della prima guerra mondiale? Non lo avrebbe fatto neanche Daisy. E per questo Jay Gatsby - nato povero come il suo creatore - si diede da fare con ogni mezzo per elevare la propria condizione. E per questo Scott scriveva racconti scadenti sulle riviste patinate dell’epoca: perché i profitti gli davano da vivere e gli permettevano di stare dietro ai costosi desideri dell’amata moglie. Avrebbe fatto qualsiasi cosa per lei, proprio come Gatsby.Forse gli scrittori hanno bisogno di soffrire, non possono fare a meno di privarsi del dolore. Non lo so.“Il Grande Gatsby” è un capolavoro. È una vicenda che brilla anche se non la si lega alla vita di chi l’ha creata, ma che, riletta alla luce di quella vita, non fa e non può che illuminarsi ancora di più."
1939,Meredith,"As a literature teacher, this is one of my favorite novels to teach. Fitzgerald is a descriptive writer, who uses words powerfully and purposefully. Lots of imagery, symbolism and illusion. He character development is great. Set in the Roaring 20s, the story line is this book parallels today's society so that lots of discussion can happen. Narcissism, fatalism, and the death of the American dream are common themes. Well worth reading."
1940,D.G.,"**Re-read May 2013**The Great Gatsby is a masterpiece that chronicles the rise and fall of a man, during the excesses of the Roaring Twenties, the decade of Jazz and Prohibition. I read it for the first time 5 years ago and loved it, so I was ecstatic a the idea of reading it again. I’ve never read a book that managed such vivid descriptions with such sparse language. The Great Gatsby is a book with no heroes. All the characters are flawed and some of them are particularly horrible. For all his worldliness and money, Gatsby is a charming fool with a boyish idea of himself who got caught up in the idea of love and couldn’t let it go. Nick has ghosts of his own so he contented himself with being the observer and became Gatsby’s friend when it was already too late. Tom and Daisy were the worst of them all: They were careless people, Tom and Daisy – they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was the kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made…Even though you may not care much for any of the characters, the story pulls you in until you want to know them all. There’s a certain melancholia about the narrative that warns you this is not a a love story gone wrong but something even worse: the terrible despair of lost dreams and the reality that sometimes, the villains get away with murder.The descriptions of New York are timeless and they are still so true that as a New Yorker, I felt them deep in my heart. It’s as if Mr. Fitzgerald described something I always knew about the City but never could put into words: The city seen from the Queenboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.If you read The Great Gatsby in high school but didn’t like it, I recommend you to give it another try as a an adult. It’s the kind of book that you may enjoy with the perspective of time and it’s simply so beautifully written that it deserves a second chance.Check out this review and others at badassbookreviews.com"
1941,Belén Read,lo primero que quiero destacar en este libro es la narración. Adoro la forma en la que el autor consigue que nos encariñemos con Nick. Siempre se me quedara grabado en la memoria el consejo que su padre le da al principio. Sin duda este libro pasa a ser uno de mis libros favoritos
1942,Lostupendomondodeilibri,"L' ho trovato un bellissimo libro..pieno di sentimento e passione, ma anche di corruzione sia materiale che dell' Anima un capolavoro!!"
1943,Rapunzel," Always, always recommend! My favourite classic (with To Kill a Mockingbird coming up for a close second), and one that embodies the idea of a Great American Novel."
1944,Ani Mkrtchyan,"I chose this book because my sister told me to read it and I wanted to understand the movie. This book is about how a guy named Gatsby wants Daisy, the love of his life, to tell Tom (her husband) that she never loved him. To talk to her, he hosts these extreme parties. Overall, it is a tragic love story about a man who wants to relive his past with his loved one, who doesn't love him back. My favorite quote is when Nick, Daisy's cousin, says “The loneliest moment in someone’s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.” This was my favorite because it shows how someone's life can fall apart so easily and all they can do about it is nothing. The book was in Nick's point of view, which is weird because the story revolves around Gatsby and his hopeless love life. I would recommend this book to anyone good at understanding complicated books because it is very tragic and well written. "
1945,Jaime Medina,"	“The Great Gatsby” by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a pleasure to read since The Great Gatsby is the defining novel of the 1920’s, which describes life of the American. Fitzgerald portrays the 1920's as a time where society has changed and it was a decade of prosperity and of jazz bands, bootleggers, and flappers. The fashion styles and technologies has changes in the 1920’s. Fitzgerald emphasizes the society's moral blindness in many characters, including those who have money and those who lack it. The 1920’s were the prohibition of the bootleggers and the speakeasies. The moral issues in The Great Gatsby were the corruption of the American Dream. Like Gatsby, he was corruption and a bootleggers. Fitzgerald’s characters live in the world and struggle to find happiness, because they live in the past and aren’t going forward. The Overall theme of the novel is that it doesn’t matter how much money you have because you can’t buy happiness with money especially when you love someone so much you can’t buy their love.The main characters in the novel are Gatsby, Daisy and Nick. Gatsby is the wealthy man in West Egg. “He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God.” He knew that when he kiss this girl he felt married to her and in the moment he and Daisy fell in love. Although, Daisy Buchanan who’s already married to Tom Buchanan, and Gatsby still had not able to move on from her. To be with their first love, Daisy and Gatsby commit adultery. Daisy’s cheating on Tom and Tom’s cheating on Daisy. Not only is Daisy an adulteress but she’s also a dishonest person not just to herself but to every person around her even Gatsby. Nick Carraway is the story's narrator. He went to Yale, he likes literature and considers himself one of those ""limited"" specialists known as a ""well-rounded man."" He fought in World War I, which he found kind of exciting and now he's moved East to work in the bond business in New York City. Nick Carraway is immortal because he’s quite naive about his faults though, he’s not aware of it.Jay Gatsby is immoral because he uses people. He also lies about his past, his parents, and his life. He makes illegal money and hangs out with gangsters. This shows that Gatsby is not trustworthy. It also shows that Gatsby makes immoral choices. Gatsby come from unsuccessful farmers. Gatsby's did not inherit the money as he would like people to believe, but he got the money from organized crime. Gatsby likes to throw big parties for the rich people. In fact, he doesn’t want to know much about them, he just wants to see if Daisy can come to one of his parties. He even bought a house across the lake from Daisy house. He did all of this to win Daisy back.Daisy Buchanan is immoral because she plays with Gatsby’s heart by leading him on for her own entertainment. She is manipulative and uses her beauty to get whatever she wants. She uses Tom, Nick, Gatsby and everyone and everything she has ever been around she bends to her purposes. She’s a shallow person and does not know true love. She was in love with Gatsby but when he went off to war she changed her mind because Tom Buchanan popped into the picture. Tom was wealthy and she knew that she would live a good life, so she completely forgot her love for Gatsby and ran off with Tom."
1946,Kelly Shull,"I've read this book a few times now, and while I've always liked it, I've also developed a strong hatred for most of the characters, especially Daisy. "
1947,Susan Weinstein,"Is GATSBY the Great American Novel or just a pretender?“Whether it’s something that happened twenty years ago or only yesterday, I must start out with an emotion—one that’s close to me and that I can understand.” F.Scott Fitzgerald This quote is key to Fitzgerald, a source of strength and criticism as a weakness-- especially in his rivalry with Hemingway. I felt revisiting this novel was like reading a diary about a lost love— nostalgic, bitter-sweet, and touching. A huge success in its era, GATSBY was later reviled as trivial, politically bankrupt , a celebration of rich people and their decadent life style. Today of course, it’s assigned reading for schools, supposedly about class and money in America. But for that, Dreiser’s An American Tragedy may be the better novel. So why is this novel a classic? Let’s begin with Nick, the haunted narrator, struggling to come to terms with events he can’t quite understand. GATSBY is a novel haunted by the inexplicable and that theme repeats, like a novel designed as a symphony or an opera. Gatsby is a man who lives in inexplicable luxury and no one knows the source of his wealth, whether it’s bootlegging or mysterious “drugstores.” Though he doesn’t drink and is self-contained, he inexplicably throws huge wild parties. Daisy and Tom are inexplicably married, though Tom’s a bulky man with rough talk and coarse excesses and Daisy’s a slight girl of delicate beauty and mannered nuance. These three are the major chords, the triangle for reverberating themes of love and loss.  Opposing themes are Nick, the honest bond salesman and his relationship with Jordan, a beautiful tennis pro. Daisy’s childhood friend, Jordan is a tough athletic woman who likes controlling her game, on the court and off. She’s “nobody’s fool” to Daisy’s dreamy attitudes. The wary attraction-repulsion Nick feels for Jordan is a counterweight to Gatsby’s complete obsession with Daisy. Nicksomehow admires and fears for Gatsby’s complete abandonment. Yet, under the spell of Gatsby’s belief, he lets him use his house to meet Daisy for tea. As Gatsby cherishes his love as the highest value, Nick cherishes honesty. So, he lends his integrity to the couple, but is uneasy. Nick’s aware of Hazel, Tom’s “woman in New York..” Though it’s not ""right"" for married Daisy to renew her affair with Gatsby, Nick has seen how Tom carelessly flaunts his affair. He rationalizes there is something okay about Daisy meeting Gatsby, since but for the war they might have married. Nick, the supposed realist, ignores the truth that Daisy didn’t wait for Gatsby but married a solid man of her class— in physical bulk and money. She even has a little girl, with her neck and face shape.  Like Chekhov’s The Sea Gull or Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina, you get the fluttery movement of love in conflict with reality and fear there will be a price. GATSBY provides a crescendo of emotion, before the horrific, somehow inevitable fall. The brilliance of GATSBY isn't the plot but that like Nick, you become a believer in Gatsby’s dream. That dream is echoed in the minor theme of Hazel, who lives out her fantasy that Tome will leave his wife and they will go away together. As Gatsby and Daisy are suited in temperament, Mabel and Tom possess animal “vitality.” Their enjoyment of money and sexual pleasure is low life, repellent to Nick, when he’s trapped in their “love nest” of a flat. He much prefers Gatsby’s ethereal fantasies, to this dark underside of ""love."" In fact, Nick, who denies attachment, finds Gatsby’s yearnings, both foolish and admirable. In the beginning, he sees Gatsby on his lawn gazing at a green light on a dock. Later, he learns that's Daisy’s dock. He’s shocked, when he comes to realize that Gatsby’s aspirations; the handsome mansion, on the edge of nouveau riche, like his crafted appearance and manners, were all acquired to win Daisy’s love. Even his parties were a hope she would wander in.  Searching for Gatsby's identity, Nick finds that for five years he has dedicated himself to this passion. Meanwhile, Nick, who prides himself on his honesty, finds reason to reject Jordan for her “easy lies.” He can’t help disparaging her self-assurance. Spoiled, he thinks, easily bored, because Jordan, like him, is a loner without moorings. A kind of society nomad, she goes from tournaments to parties, to other people’s houses. Always at her leisure, she’s never quite engaged. So in the end, when she tells him she is actually engaged to be married, he's in disbelief, without acknowledging his own failure to risk love. What Nick the realist does get, more than Gatsby, is that Daisy and Jordan, are “rich girls,” meaning they think much of themselves. Jordan’s proud independence is as much a pose as Daisy’s particular delicacy. When Gatsby asks Nick to invite Daisy (his cousin) for tea, the event is the pinnacle of all Gatsby's striving to deserve her—his castle in the air. Nick surmises this, when he meets Gatsby’s “associate,” a man of dubious criminal activities. But this matters little to Nick, who wants Gatsby to win, when he grasps the depth of Gatsby’s love; the drive for him to acquire the appearance of aristocracy, money and taste. That Gatsby’s high romance ends tragically for him, as does Mable’s, isn't a surprise. But this plot is not news. In the end, Nick wonders how such an ambitious talented man could end up with no real friend but himself? How did his great unselfish love lead to his downfall? When Nick attributes it to class and money, he's only partially accurate. He calls Tom and Daisy “careless” in the way of rich people that can do damage and retreat into their wealth and that's true. But it's not Fitzgerald's point. The larger theme he plays is the pathos in the inevitable shortcomings of human existence.  In a lifetime, a man shoots for the heavens, yet must eventually come to earth. And love as transcendence, though hardly adequate, is something. Nick finally admits that at the end. When Jordan says she had cared for him, as a man who prided himself on honesty, he denies himself. Says he never did.But he comes to know his own self-delusion and what it has cost him.  Fitzgerald's written a great American novel, though I don't think it's THE definitive one about our culture. His friend John Dos Passos was a chronicler of class in his USA Trilogy. Fitzgerald wrote about the timeless flapper and endless love."
1948,Hannah Brown,"The parties at Gatsby’s Long Island mansion were legendarily glamorous affairs.Yet amid the throng of guests, starlets and champagne waiters, their host would appear oddly aloof. For there was only one person Jay Gatsby sought to impress. She was Daisy Buchanan: married, elegant, seducing men with a silken charisma and ‘a voice…full of money’.As Gatsby pursues shady deals and his doomed obsession with Daisy, F. Scott Fitzgerald distils the essence of the Jazz Age, and probes to the empty heart of the American Dream. – Blurb from Penguin Popular Classics bookIn 2013, I believe, The Great Gatsby was gifted to me by a pen-pal in Scotland at Christmas. I don’t know why I didn’t pick up the book before now – maybe the idea of reading it didn’t interest me, or I had other things to read – and the book was pushed to the back of the pile. Then, I had a question from her asking about my characters and who they would be in Gatsby. That was when I decided it had to be read.I was pleasantly surprised, and regret not picking it up earlier. Although it didn’t entice me to begin with – moreover, I had trouble deciphering exactly what the book was talking about due to language I was not used to (but has apparently furrowed its way into my mind) – it grew on me, and I spent one morning finishing it off after not turning a page for about a week. It was in this morning of the 26th June 2014 that I fell in love with the book. The characters are all unique to themselves – Daisy with her snootiness and naivetés; Nick with his straight-forward thinking and probably the most stable of the lot; and finally Gatsby, with his ‘doomed obsession’ and varying moods. The have different voices and even catchphrases, old sport. They are also painted in such a way you can see them as you read, and they become real. Obviously, this is something you want in a good piece of writing, and it is presented perfectly. As for the plot, well, it isn’t the most interesting. It is the way Fitzgerald has told it that makes it interesting. Events that occur all the way through – side plots, if you will – add to the main one, and make it so the actual plot doesn’t bore you. Sure, this is used in all books, but I particularly noted it in Gatsby. Vivid descriptions that bring the scenes to life. Fitzgerald’s way of narrating is, although it was written 88 years ago, rather relatable also. I think it was Fitzgerald’s entertaining voice that kept me reading; that, and the descriptions, which were brilliant. I think this is one of the few books I would be willing to read again, and may even do so. Overall, I seriously recommend Gatsby. Some people may not like it because they had to study it in school (that really does destroy so many good books!) but I think that if you want to have a look into the past, it’s a brilliant way to do so. Although I can’t yet completely put my finger on why I love this book so, I think it has something to do with the characters – maybe they’ll grow on you, too. I may even try watching the film."
1949,James Curry,"like much of my best thinking, this review was born as a reaction to an idea I didn't like, from a review of this book ON THIS VERY WEBSITE. it's a comment, so you can find it if you like. I'm an asshole and kind of pushy with my ideas, whatever, books are a personal thing, here's my comment/review of the book, detailing why I love this book and what I think it ~means~:the great Gatsby is about the god damn DEATH OF THE AMERICAN DREAM, and the simultaneously fruitless and eternal drive for progress and splendor that characterizes America. I think the book is brilliant because it seems to completely emotionally foreshadow the Great Depression by expressing a dread and disillusionment in the overly lavish lifestyle of the 1920s, and gets at something deep in the American spirit. I mean, it's not just big expensive parties in this book, there's also that old guy who lives in front of the billboard (it's been a while since I read the book), in a fucking DESERT that's eerie because it kinda makes me think of the fucking Dust Bowl and because it's right in between two rich-ass metropolitan zones. that's America: a land of plenty and a land of dust, landscapes rendered uneven by economic booms and busts that keep people either miserable or greedy and hollow.fuck there's SO much going on in this book, and if you don't like it, that's okay, but it's kind of dumb to hope for like an explicit ""psychological"" discussion within the book because that would kind of neutralize its message and literalize what's supposed to be a little more implicit and rather deeper. I think it's no accident that the ending kind of alludes to Plymouth Rock–Fitzgerald is tying his story to the genesis of America, and in the rest of the line ties it to its future as well. what happens in this book is a lot deeper than JUST what ""people in the 20s were like"" (though it's that too), and its simplicity and ambiguity gives a lot of room for imaginative readings, if only you let it.but I mean, that's just my opinion. you probably ain't reading these anymore, but fuck it, I LOVE this book the more I look back on it, I can easily see why someone would call it a Great American Novel."
1950,Caleb,"Update: January 31, 2016--I just got through rereading this book almost two years after my first read. I was a little nervous the text wouldn't hold the same magic for me in the second read-through, but I couldn't have been more wrong. This book is still wonderfulThrough the torture of all those ""classics"" the average teenager is subjected to throughout their experiences in High School, occasionally he or she happens upon a book that is actually fully deserving of the praise it has received over the ages. For me, The Great Gatsby was one of those books. While books are often chosen for educational purposes because of heavy symbolism and deeper meaning, Gatsby manages to pull this off while still being interesting. Gatsby is a complex character, and the plot that ravels and eventually unravels around him leaves the reader with no real endearing feelings for any of the characters at all--and yet, there is a lasting impact. By the end of this novel, I was not Gatsby's biggest fan, and I didn't care much for Nick. I was disappointed in Daisy and mad at Tom, but the route all the characters took in the end made sense. There is something incredibly real about this book. I won't say much else about this book, because I cannot stand the long-held tradition that it is okay to give away spoilers on books that are classics. I've never understood why the reader ought to know the ending of the book in advance just because it is old and famous, and so I will not force anyone else to hear the ending of Gatsby before reading it themselves. The only other thing I have to say is that the character of Jordan Baker is one I find to be absolutely hysterical and largely overlooked. "
1951,Peter,"The Great Gatsby is one of those books that everyone should read at some point in their life. The book is getting close to being a century old and is still present in pop culture. Like many ‘classics’ it is tough to put your finger on what exactly is so great about The Great Gatsby. All I can say is that there is just something about it. An aura that very few works of art can achieve and continue to radiate many years later. It is a story where all that glitters is not gold. Where a person’s social status may not correlate with their character. It also has the original legendary playboy Jay Gatsby whose parties are so well described by the narrator they grab a unique hold of your imagination. The reader will easily find intrigue. I found myself amazed at how universal the story remains despite its deep roots in a period of history. The book captures a time where the economy boomed and emotions were volatile but the human story is where the real magic is. To me, The Great Gatsby is ‘the’ Great American Novel.

1952,Ms Cochran,"One of the classes I sub for was reading this, and I hadn't read it since 10th grade, so decided to read it again. I'm certain I was much better able to appreciate it this time through. One of the great American novels. "
1953,Emily Williams,"The Great Gatsby is known by many for it's new Leonardo Dicaprio film adaptation as Jay Gatsby.Which I have no problem with and is a well written and thought out book to movie adaptation.But there are many things about this book that put it on my top list of favorite books ever.This book is a fantastic classic read.Very fast paced as well.The character of Jay Gatsby is unlike any character in literary history.His love for Daisy consumes him into wanting to rewrite his own past which we all know is bound to be disaster.But along with this you really feel for Gatsby in a way that isn't like any other character that I have read.His constant obsession for the American dream feeds him ultimately to his doom.Which leaves the reader with the question.What does this mean for society today?We constantly wish for perfection and a perfect fairytale life with not a single care in the world but Gatsby shows up that that isn't always a good thing to strive for.And can be your undoing.As for Daisy, I enjoyed Daisy.But not to the Gatsby extent.I found that she lacked a bit of personality and an understanding quality.All this time with a husband she loves to hate and is trapped in this lifestyle she doesn't want.Nick is another one of my favorite characters. He see's the entire story unfold and is our main narrator.In a way Nick learns a lot of Gatsby's actions and was a good friend in a sense to Gatsby during the main climax of the book.All in all each character of the book in a way represents a different character and society and shows us that living the 'American dream' is not a feasible goal in our lifestyles and it really makes you take a step back and look at your whole perspective.Very quick read.I would recommend to anyone and everyone. "
1954,George Crain,"IT is a still day. The sun is still, the trees and the summer sky too. It is blue and still. Many things have happened, one of them- this week I finished three books. Today I finished The Great Gatsby. The last line of the book read: So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past. I read that and everything that came before it and it made my heart ache. There is so much beauty there; so much purpose and melancholy. I thought of a still life that I have seen, a painting of a magnolia blossom. It is cut at the very prime of its life, it rests unblemished and white against a dark cloth. The way that it is rendered it is more fragile than a flower, all careful brush strokes and smooth like the artist worked more with water than with paint. There is not an obvious source of light, it is not day or night. The flower is there, listless under its own weight, a fantasy of light that never fell on earth but lived somewhere in the artist’s mind. The magnolia is Daisy and her moon-shaped face, her vanishing lips and voice like money. Daisy’s sing-song voice, not so much like money but the immortal promise of wealth. A voice that promised security and entertainment too, a thrilling voice that lilted even under the strain and weight of a half-dozen cocktails. A voice that never existed except to haunt Fitzgerald, a voice only he heard, sometimes, maybe even on the slender and slurred words that passed Zelda‘s lips. It is such a beautiful book! A whole world of ghosts and light that only exists high up, among slowly shifting clouds. What a romantic Fitzgerald was! To believe in love that would conquer all, love that would beat fear; love that would defeat drugs and vanity and lust. There seems so much of Fitzgerald’s in the poor hero Gatsby. I imagine part of Fitzgerald would like to have died too when the memory of perfect love, unconquerable; brighter than all hope and more vital than the electric current of lust was close, when its memory was fresh. Before not only the memory of great love was stale but also the memory of its death. When love finally was a shivering fragment of itself, a cool and quiet feeling that even fear, or loss or something worse, could hardly rouse. But Fitzgerald did not die; he did not stop there, he went on to write more good books but not like this, not like The Great Gatsby. It is a classic."
1955,Zishan Shaikh,"Oh my! This book made me fall in love with euphemism, metaphors and symbolism!The Great Gatsby is a scrupulously detailed story about wealth, love ,madness, obsession and tragedy! Carefully observe the sequence in which I jot down these adjectives. This tale describes Jay Gatsby's journey from wealth to madness and then ultimately to towards tragedy. The story is set in an era of American history where everything and everyone can be bought! But money can surely not erase your past now, can it?The story starts at a very reasonable and imaginable pace. Fitzgerald introduces Nick Carraway in a very intriguing manner and makes you wonder if he himself ever wanted to be like Nick. Nick is basically the narrator of the story, who served the US army during World War I and then came to New York to establish a career for himself. The tale starts in West Egg, Long Island where Nick lives in a rented house. This place is right next to the Gatsby mansion. As and when time grows, Nick is fascinated by the lavish lifestyle of his colossally rich and seemingly mysterious neighbor, Jay Gatsby, who is known for the plush and posh parties he very frequently throws. Little is known about this rich fellow, thus leading to morbid rumors that surround him. They way Fitzgerald describes the enormity of his parties for the first time in the book, swayed me off and made me create an absolute image of the wealth of Gatsby.Daisy, who happens to be Nick's cousin, and her husband Tom Buchanan get along quite well with him. Throughout the book, Nick seems to hate Tom for every movement of his. The way Fitzgerald develops and introduces all these characters is very ecstatic! Daisy when introduced in the book, makes you fall in love with her, just with the dreamy description and all! Tom's development in the book will make you hate him right away, just like Nick does. Another character, Jordan Baker, who is ""supposedly"" in love with Nick and vice-versa, has a strong sense of emergence. The way she is introduced by the narrator is amusing. The relationship of the past between Jay and Daisy and Tom and his mistress, is the central plot of the book!I certainly look forward to read this masterpiece by Fitzgerald again!""Who says you cannot repeat the past? Of course you can!"" -- Jay Gatsby."
1956,Knarik Avetisyan,"История об утраченном времени и о неоцененных усилиях, которые были предприняты, чтобы это время вернуть...Почти все мои друзья читали эту книгу и написали по ней рецензию, и я тоже собираюсь сделать это. Прочитала я эту книгу задолго до ее экранизации, где-то 2 года назад, но до сих пор помню ее очень четко. Будучи представителем ""потерянного поколения"" из ""века джаза"", Фицджеральд очень красочно и ярко передал все краски того времени. Во всех его работах он пишет о роскоши, богатстве, власти, которая дается благодаря благосостоянию, и о потерянных бедных богатых душах, которые хотели самых простых вещей - вещей, которые нельзя было купить, обменять или забрать силой. События в романе охватывает много людей. Ник Каррауэй — главный герой, 30 лет, ведущий рассказ от первого лица. Переехал в Нью-Йорк весной 1922 года. На момент повествования занимался операциями с ценными бумагами в небольшой фирме. Выпускник Йеля. Принадлежит к почтенному зажиточному семейству на Среднем Западе. Джей Гэтсби — загадочный сосед Ника, нувориш, чьи род занятий и прошлое окутано тайной для всех гостей и знакомых. В этом человеке было поистине нечто великолепное, какая-то повышенная чувствительность ко всем посулам жизни. Обладал редкостным даром надежды, который и погубил его. Благочестивый, обаятельный, желанный, преданный своему сердцу.Дэйзи Бьюкенен — троюродная сестра Ника. Из богатой семьи, выросшая в Луисвилле. Та, из-за которой, собственно, все это и случилось.Том Бьюкенен — муж Дэйзи. Из богатой семьи, однокурсник и знакомый Ника по университету, где блистал в команде по американскому футболу. Был фигурой, в своём роде характерной для Америки, одним из тех молодых людей, которые к двадцати одному году достигают в чем-то самых вершин, и потом, что бы они ни делали, всё кажется спадом. Том всю жизнь носится с места на место в чуть тоскливой погоне за безвозвратно утраченной остротой ощущений футболиста.Джордан Бейкер — подруга Дэйзи, выросшая в городе Луисвилл. Спортсменка-гольфистка, по мнению Ника, ""неисправимо нечестна"". Циничная персона, которая единственная понимала, что творится вокруг нее. Джордж Вильсон — владелец автомобильной мастерской из Долины Шлака, муж, которого предали, уничтожили, использовали и превратили в убийцу.Миртл Вильсон — жена Джорджа и любовница Тома, одна из самых вульгарных особ, которую когда либо описывал Фицджеральд. Недалекая, необразованная женщина, которая стремилась занять свое место рядом с другими сливками того общества, но безнадежно привязанная к мещанской жизни и обреченная к жалкому существованию и к такой же жалкой смерти.Все персонажи по своему уникальны. Их списанные образы можно сейчас встретить во многих других книгах. Гэтсби, достиг высот и не свалился. Он погрузился туда, как и в свой огромный бассейн - в собственной крови и в недопонимании. Он так и не понял за что, почему, как, зачем... Он был слишком хорош для этого мира, поэтому мир его поглотил."
1957,Hasnain Bahleem,"Sometimes its hard to be a critic, which from the point of others may seem easy, we pass our judgement , our inquisitive thoughts and opinion on something we see in our critical perspective, but sometimes it very hard, there are times when we cannot express the beauty of something which is beyond beautiful.Its visions mesmerizes us and we loose our words, and we remain speechless, thats when i felt when i saw the beauty of the great Gatsby.Why i call this tragedy a beauty, because beauty is something which we gain with a price and i'm sure Mr. Gatsby knew, the perfidy of fate, that beauty will cost us something, something very important, and mr Gatsby gave the biggest price of all. When i first took a look into mr. Gatsby's character, it seemed to me as a mystery, a bewitching mystery that i would soon discover something cincister behind the curtain, but i would gave never imagined something so determined, something so deep, something someone would do out of love.There are hardly people in this world like Gatsby, hardly.Daisy was a fool, and Gatsby i think was a bigger fool, a fool with a heart of gold.Who thought he could win over people with his extravagance, his money, their respect, he honestly thought these feelings from fake people would be anything real, would the love of daisy, the girl who was worried to be with him knowing he was poor, who was so confused to hear her own heartbeat would love him.Reality is bitter than false addictive sweet fantasy and that reality hit Gatsby the most.A wonderful beguiling tragedy, about bitter face of reality."
1958,Rao Umar,"There are not many books in this world that makes reader feels like living in the story; The Great Gatsby is one of those books.The book warmly welcomed with ravishing details about moral rotation of life and its effects on the narrator which generated an enthusiasm in my mind but soon the profound monologue leads to one name “Gatsby”.Jay Gatsby who gives a face to the book, Nick (The Narrator) who gives it a voice! And a very rowdy but a very eloquent voice that elaborates all vivid happening and misshaping that take please throughout. May be that is why Nick is favorite character in the book. It was like sharing a mind with Nick because whatever question came to my mind was the next dialogue of Nick, like who is Gatsby? Form where he came? How he became the man he was now? And soon all of my and Nicks question were answered in the end. The book accomplished my heart with its sparking descriptions and the intensity of its words. How every F. Scott Fitzgerald conveyed a very humble story which urged my curiousness but could have been more enigmatic. Yet this is one book I will all ways recommend my friends but I assume people will focus more on the movie so now I will watch the movie.  -Over and Out  Rao Umar"
1959,Mariana P. Vallejo,"Es bastante interesante mi relación con este libro, lo odié al inicio pero el final, de cierta manera, lo salvó. De inicio lo sentí como una historia lenta o sin sentido y al entorno y a los personajes los sentí bastante superficiales y tontos, lo que aparentemente debido a la época es normal, pero... sigue molestándome bastante, no hace que cambié mi percepción de los hechos.De cualquier manera, se recuperó por lo que significaba la novela y lo que significaba Gatsby."
1960,Pam,"what more can be said about this that hasn't' already been said, the writing is beautiful, the ending was great, i really enjoyed it and now that i've read it i want to watch the movie again with fresh eyes, i pictured leonardo dicaprio as gatsby the whole way through which is always fun, i think nick is in love with gatsby, that might not have been fitzgerald's intention but to me is glaringly obvious"
1961,Lance,"
""EVERY ONE suspects himself of at least one of his cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people I have ever known,"" says Nick Carraway in Chapter 3 of The Great Gatsby, considered by critics as a ""Great American Novel"" and arguably F. Scott Fitzgerald's greatest work. I don't know if I'll agree or disagree with that—this is his first story I've read. (I did get to watch 
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
 based on the short story he wrote, but that doesn't count, does it?)


You've probably read the book or heard about it somehow. Sure, many people adore it, but I wanted to be in the know before the movie comes out. It's a priceless feeling, really: seeing the book replayed in moving images before your very eyes. I've long since overcome the habit of telling my friends, ""The book is better than the film,"" because that's almost always the case 99% of the time.


Nick's confession of honesty is vital throughout the entire book. As the narrator he must establish himself credible and nonjudgmental. In the first chapter, though, he confesses that although he prizes his tolerance of various people, a quality that earned him the title of a politician in Yale, he has failed to withhold his judgment when he came to know Jay Gatsby, his mysterious and rich neighbor.


True to its title, the story revolves around this rich man Gatsby, who holds the grandest weekly parties in his mansion at the West Egg, whose origins nobody is really certain of, who one day sends Nick an invitation to join him for the festivities. They become good friends—a contestable categorization—and Nick gradually learns of Gatsby's deepest secrets.


I'm not going to spill the beans any longer. Do get a free copy of the book. It really is a short read. Let me say this, though: F. Scott Fitzgerald illustrated in Jay Gatsby a picture of a man who idolizes material wealth and human approval. His is a rags-to-riches story. He has engaged in questionable affairs to enrich himself, hoping to win the approval of the love of his life, who, at the end of it all, deserts him anyway.


Gatsby died eventually, and the account of his burial made me re-think of whether I'm investing my life in eternal pursuits rather than a mere chasing after the wind. 


A little before three the Lutheran minster arrived from Flushing, and I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did Gatsby's father. And as the time passed and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously, and he spoke of the rain in a worried, uncertain way. The minister glanced at his watch, so I took him aside and asked him to wait for an half an hour. But it wasn't any use. Nobody came.


It is a truly great book, one that exposes the idols we harbor in our hearts for goals other than to glorify God. On closer examination we realize we're not so different from Gatsby. As Nick confesses, "". . . It occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well."" We must be humbled by Gatsby's tragedy. "
1962,Cheryl,I can't imagine why I didn't like this in high school. Maybe I've just grown up enough to appreciate the beauty of Fitzgerald's writing.
1963,Henry C.,"Writing a review of ""The Great Gatsby"" is superfluous. It is one of the most beloved (and analyzed) books in American literature. But, new years resolutions are new years resolutions. And, so, in the spirit of Jay Gatz's self improvement list, here we are.Lets skip the plot and character blah, blah, blah. If you are reading this, I hope you know that stuff. If not, just read the book. This book is so often on ""required"" reading lists that it can scare people away. No one likes to be told to do anything. There are absolutely ""required"" books that are just dogs. They are lost in time and space, they are designed to give you a flavor for an era with plots and characters and other elements that feel antiquated and boring.This is not one of those books. As someone who has read ""Gatsby"" probably four or five or more times over the years, some of them ""required"" most of them not, I can say with all my (limited) authority this is one of the greatest works of fiction ever written. As a reader and a writer I learn something new from it every time I read it. What stood out this time: The pace. ""Gatsby"" is such a propulsive read. By modern standards, it's a quite short book, really. And yet it is all here: the summing up of an era; the well drawn portraits of familiar characters and, as important, the mystery and the plot. To be as entertaining and to say as much as is said here (nevermind the beauty of the prose) is just something that can hardly be praised enough. Read it. Read it. Read it."

1965,Nada,"Beautifully written. The language is lush and the imagery is sensuous. If you enjoy literature and symbolism, it's definitely a must read."
1966,Duane,"Fitzgerald's masterpiece about wealth, high society, love, lust, and tragedy. The first half of the 20th century was the golden age of American literature and this novel was one of the very best from that era."
1967,Quinn Collard,"Oh The Great Gatsby. I first read you on my own in junior high, just when I was starting to read every ""grown-up"" book I could get my hands on. Then I read you for school in my junior year of high school. You were always a book that entirely blew me away.And...now I've read you as a certified ""grown-up"" and, well, it was an entirely different experience. Things I've been through personally between the last reading and this one really made the course of the book hit me much, MUCH harder, and I'm not sure if that made reading you now better or worse. Being able to *really* connect to a certain character made me able to appreciate this reading much more, but the connection was also so deep and intense that this reading was also rather painful."
1968,Stephanee,I still love this novel as much as I did in Mrs. Barnes's sophomore English class.
1969,Edward W.,"Truly one of the best novels ever written. Fitzgerald is a master at capturing the essence of the human spirit in The Great Gatsby. Set in (mostly) 1922, The Great Gatsby is more than a face-value tale of hopeless love. Fitzgerald gives you a story to highlight an underlying meaning as simple as: We reach towards what kills us. We love what we cannot have and we cannot have what we love. The Great Gatsby is about the failure of ever attaining your brightest dream and realizing you had nothing to begin with. This novel is not for anyone reading to find a story. The Great Gatsby is for those who want to see the deeper meaning to things. If you are under the age of 21 or enjoy simple stories without having to search for depth, avoid this novel. This is truly for the seeker of what lies in the heart. "
1970,Claire Dickerson,"When I first read this book for my freshman english class, I absolutely hated it. Maybe it was because being forced to read for me usually takes the fun out of it. This book is mainly about a young man named Nick Carraway and his story about how his life dramatically changed when he crosses paths with his neighbor, a millionaire Mr. Jay Gatsby. Although the book started off a little slow for me, once Gatsby entered the picture I was hooked. The image of Gatsby sparked the book for me and turned it from a boring english assigned book to one of my favorites. Gatsby? What Gatsby? you may ask, well Mr.Gatsby is a very rich and powerful man which the book revolves around who in the beginning we only here about through rumors Nick hears. This really adds to the mystery of the whole Gatsby bad-boy persona which I loved. Once Nick actually meets Mr. Gatsby, the mystery of his true story only grows. Even though Gatsby is filthy rich, I completely sympathize with him. I admire his undeniable passion and teaching the reader that it only matters how you see yourself and the rest should follow. One of the main reasons I really connected with the book is because I felt very relatable to Gatsby. We both have big dreams and once we set a goal and have an image, we will do anything to make it happen.Another great aspect of the story is the fun and crazy setting of the roaring 1920's. As described in the recent movie of ""The Great Gatsby, """"The buildings were higher. The parties were bigger.The morals were looser and the liquor was cheaper."" This upbeat fast-paced description was certainly shown through Gatsby's insane parties. The book really emphasizes how glamorous the 1920's were and makes me wish I could have experienced it for myself.One of the last main reasons why I loved this book was because of the not your average love story between Daisy and Gatsby. I will admit I am a sucker for a good love story, but this one was really special. Despite Gatsby's wealth, the story shows that money can't buy you happiness. Though the ending isn't exactly what I wanted, to me it adds to the mystery and power of the famous great Gatsby. "
1971,Bryan Ball,Proper review to come. 
1972,Jarred Gaudineer," Nick Carreway wants to start selling bonds. Nick rents a house in West Egg. He has a weird next-door neighbor named Jay Gatsby. Jay throws parties in his mansion every Saturday night. One day Nick drives to East Egg to see his cousin Daisy Buchannon. Daisy is married to one of his former classmates, Tom. They introduce Nick to Jordan Baker, and they begin a romantic relationship. Eventually, Nick gets invited to one of Jay Gatsby's parties. He finds Jordan there, and meets Jay Gatsby in person. Jay tells Jordan that he is in love with Daisy, and the only purpose of the parties is to impress Daisy. Jay wants Nick to arrange a meeting between him and Daisy. The meeting happens, and Jay and Daisey begin a romantic relationship. Over time Tom becomes suspicious of his wife's relationship with Jay. At a get-together at the Buchannon's house, Tom realizes his wife is having an affair. He forces the group to go to NYC, and he confronts Jay in a hotel room.It is ironic he is mad because he is having an affair with a woman named Myrtle. Daisy realizes that she actually is in love with Tom. When the group is driving back to West Egg, Gatsby runs over Myrtle. Tom tells, George that it was Jay who ran over his wife, and George shoots Jay.My favorite description of the setting was when the author described Jays's mansion on page 5. The author goes into detail about the elegance of the mansion, talking about its marble swimming pool and giant lawns. The author does do a good job of describing the setting because I can visualize Jay's house."

1974,Mindy,"I received this novel through Goodreads' First Reads Program. I just have to say, this is one of my favorite books of all time. I love re-reading it every year or so. The way Fitzgerald wrote makes me immerse myself into the novel. I feel like I am an active participant in the story."
1975,Claire Neibergall,"“The Great Gatsby”, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is an interesting book about the search for love and happiness through money and other materialistic ideals. “The Great Gatsby” is set in early 1920’s as the American society is recovering from World War I and alcohol is banned. The story is centered on the friendship of Nick Carraway and his next door neighbor Jay Gatsby. After moving from the Midwest to New York to work in the bond business, Nick Carraway moves next door to the mysterious Jay Gatsby in West Egg, Long Island. Mr. Gatsby is famous in the area for throwing wild parties while no one knows his background. West Egg is home for the newly rich from investments in the stock market or through bootlegging alcohol during Prohibition. Nick re-connects with his cousin Daisy Buchanan, her husband Tom Buchanan, and her best friend Jordan Baker who live in the upper class, more prestigious East Egg area. Nick quickly learns that Mr. Gatsby already knows Daisy from before the war and has transformed himself to appear worthy to win back her love through his materialistic belongings and appearances. “The Great Gatsby” follows a group of shallow and selfish characters who search for happiness through money and materialistic possessions with little regard to the impact on other people’s lives.The main purpose of “The Great Gatsby” was to show the readers how the pursuit of wealth, a lavish lifestyle, and a better social status can destroy people’s moral values. The early 1920’s were a time where people gained large amounts of money in the financial boom after World War I. The 1920’s, also known as the “Jazz Age”, was a time of Prohibition where alcohol was banned. The main characters give the appearance of people with elite social standing which is desirable during the 1920’s, but underneath they have no moral values. Tom and Daisy Buchanan appear to have a happy marriage but Tom is having an affair with the wife of his mechanic. Tom uses his association with his mechanic to gain access to his mistress, Myrtle Wilson. Tom has no regard for George or Myrtle as they are poor and only exist to satisfy his needs. Unlike Tom, Jay Gatsby has connections to the criminal world in order to gain wealth to achieve a higher social class. Gatsby re-created himself to re-gain the love of Tom’s wife, Daisy Buchanan. The reader learns that Gatsby has bootlegging activities which in the Jazz Age is undesirable for the social group that he wants to be accepted into. Gatsby justifies his criminal bootlegging activities because it allows him to gain the lifestyle to get closer to Daisy. Tom believes that he is better than Gatsby because he was born into wealth instead of earning it through opportunity. Tom confronts Gatsby about the origin of his money and it revealed that he has had business dealings with some of Tom’s upper class friends. The Jazz Age of the 1920’s created opportunities for everyday people to get the wealth needed to rise in the social classes and experience lavish lifestyles. The destruction of established moral values in the pursuit of excessive wealth and the resulting consequences are major themes throughout the book. Each of the main characters disregards basic moral values in order to get ahead in society or to gain an advantage over one another. Jay Gatsby and Tom Buchanan each have affairs with another man’s wife in order to satisfy a need to feel better about their lives. While Tom’s affair with Myrtle appears on the surface to be a physical attraction, Tom feels a need to control other people’s actions. While Gatsby’s desire for Daisy is based on love, he resorts to bootlegging to attain the wealth needed to be worthy of someone of her social standing. Daisy, who appears to be desirable to all that meet her, is blinded by social standing, wealth, and the un-attainable ideal of perfect love. Daisy’s selfishness ultimately destroys the only thing that is near perfect, which is Gatsby’s love.“The Great Gatsby” is narrated by one of the main characters, Nick Carraway who is a participant in the book. Nick’s narration of the relationships and characteristics of the people involved provide the reader with a firsthand view of the events that unfold. Nick’s first person narration is accompanied by his analysis of the events and his friends, which shows the readers his flaws. Nick passes judgment on the other characters without their knowledge which gives him the appearance of being dishonest in his relationships. However, the reader is able to view Jay Gatsby differently at the end of the book because of Nick’s personal relationship with him. Nick’s relationship with Jay Gatsby allows the reader to see Gatsby as a man searching for what he believes as true love instead of common criminal seeking wealth and an extravagant lifestyle.“The Great Gatsby” was a good book that showed what life was like on the East Coast of America in the early 1920’s. The story was easy to follow and painted a luxurious lifestyle which is really different than life is today. The behavior of the characters made me uncomfortable as they treated each other so badly, especially behind each other’s backs. In the end, I really wanted Daisy to choose to marry Gatsby instead of staying married to Tom. The ending was disturbing to me as Gatsby, who worked hard to become worthy of Daisy, took the consequences for her actions and was thrown away like a piece of trash. "
1976,Maryam,"A few months after starting my freshman year of high school, my class was assigned The Great Gatsby to read. In truth, the appreciation I held for this novel initially was all but nonexistent. It wasn't until I was assigned an essay prompt in the following weeks, where I was forced to truly analyze the novel, that I decided to reread The Great Gatsby and give it all the time, love, and attention the novel deserves. The rhetoric and masterful use of symbolism Fitzgerald evokes is only but the exterior of a harsh message that lies at the end of the journey that is this novel, and the reader will find themselves experiencing the frustration, sense of appalling, and wonder that our narrator lives. The Great Gatsby exposes the very essence of our dreams and desires and casts them under a grating beam of reality. Going by this book, the American Dream only looks like an enchanting ""dream"" from an outsider's perspective. Funny how that message can apply to times decades and decades apart. Some people never feel a connection to the story and/or its characters, but I personally could not have been more involved and utterly enraptured by it. Really, I have no words for how much I love this classic. Should you read The Great Gatsby? Most definitely. Everyone should, at least once."
1977,Heidi,"This book just gets better with more reads. When I first read it 4 or 5 years ago, I thought it was about Carraway rather than Gatsby. Now I think it's about Gatsby, but there is so so much going on. Each read will bring out some other great thing about it...psychological insights, social commentary, universal truths, humor, and to attempt to make this list just flattens to two dimensions what is a three dimensional portrait.This book drew readers to the book group from their 20s to their 70s. All acknowledged the stellar prose and the consummate skill of the telling."
1978,Pattarawut Sophontanabodee,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald! I really enjoyed reading this book. It's great book and I don't regret it. I feel like the writing of this book is really strong and powerful. The strengths of the book is it's so powerful and I can feel the feeling of all the character when I read it. The weakness would be it confused me at some point. I watched this movie about last year and it got me interested on reading the book. The book has obviously shown all characteristic of all the character. Gatsby got killed at the end and I think it's wrong, he didn't deserve it because of what he did not do anything wrong that's why I think this book is really interesting to me. I would highly recommend this book to everyone who interested in drama because it gave the feeling of the character really well. "
1979,Leeann Mccaig,Re-reading this book reminded me of the reason I ADORE the classics. The writing is unparalleled. Under no other circumstances have I gotten butterflies in my tummy from the description of the color of a RUG. This is the best work of fiction I have read in a long time.
1980,Stephanie Perez," The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a novel that I have been wanting to read considering I had heard great things about it. Very easy to read and listen to since I used both an audio book and a text book to get through the story. Written in first person, Nick Carraway tells the story about the summer he met Mr. Gatsby. Initially, I thought the story would be told by Mr. Gatsby himself, and even though this caught me off guard I realized that it is much better to know Mr. Gatsby through another character. The truth is that at first I was somewhat bored because I expected the focus to be mostly on Mr. Gatsby’s parties, and yet, that was just an issue that served as a backdrop to everything else. For this reason, the first couple of chapters of the book did not interest me too much. However, as the author introduces all the characters, my interest for this novel grew. The story hooked me and I felt more and more curious to discover what would happen next. It is a story about love, hope, action, mystery, and drama.Nick Carraway tells the story of a man that everyone knows but at the same time no one really seems to know, Mr. Gatsby. Carraway’s initial perception of Mr. Gatsby was of someone false and hypocritical, but gradually this view changed and they became great friends. This gave way for us to know more about Gatsby other than all the rumors that were revolving around Nick. However, the fact of the matter appears when we learn Gatsby’s true intentions towards Nick, which is regain the love of his life, Daisy Buchanan.Despite being a short story and not knowing much of what happens in the period of time our characters are meeting each other, our narrator focuses on key scenes. For me, these scenes became iconic in the forming of each character’s portrayal. The Great Gatsby is an excellent novel to know the human heart in its full splendor. I found it fascinating that one of the main issues is the past and the futility of trying to live in it, or even trying to recreate it."
1981,Lindsay,"I read this book in high school, like every other sophomore did, and I'll be honest, it was not one of my favorites. I think I was so excited to have a love story intertwined in a required curriculum book that I forgot to look for any scholarly significance and instead I just ended up distraught that Daisy and Gatsby didn't get together in the end. However, I've decided that if a book is required for high school students then I should at least have some appreciation for the work. Good choice Lindsay! I read it again and loved every second of it! Fitzgerald is amazing. I finished the book and felt like I was swimming in all the imagery and political cues. It's a fairly easy read, but it has so much significance that you could read it a hundred times and continue picking up new gems of wisdom. I had to rent the movie, about two days after finishing the book, to have another go at the book's symbolism.Although Nick Carraway has always kind of bothered me for some reason (he seems like an awkward fly on the wall...all the time), the character development in this book is amazing. Everything is so deliberately done. Of course, one of the overarching themes of the novel, is the failure of the American Dream with the corruption and demoralization of society. However, as I read the book this time, I was intrigued by how Gatsby lived and dreamed in the past. It is one of the great tragedies of the novel, in my opinion, that Gatsby persistently fails to move forward in life. At his funeral, there's a poignant contrast between young Gatsby's list of to-dos compared with what had been Gatsby's stagnant reality--he had striven for something that was already over, something that was years behind him. Gatsby lived on the hope of Daisy--the green light in the distance, just like the faraway, but ever present American dream--but he never realized the impossibility and the falsity of his dream.The novel also plays on the dichotomies of man, God, and incarnation (fascinating theme throughout the book); old money verses new money; religious awareness verses atheistic apathy; success verses failure; life verses death; etc. Overall, a fabulous book that I would recommend anyone to reread!"
1982,John Gillespie,"It's hard for me to remember a time before this book was part of my world. My Mom loved the Robert Redford/Mia Farrow movie, and she and my Dad dressed up as Gatsby and Daisy for parties sometimes. So I don't even know when I first read it. I read it again yesterday because of a book club, and it it amazing how a short novel about people I'd never like in real life can matter so much thanks to a masterful writer. Like the enigmatic allure of Daisy's voice, Fitzgerald's prose seduces you to lean closer. In the end, I don't even care if it's superficial nonsense or the greatest profundity. "
1983,Ben Davis,"Maybe it's because I originally read this in high school and was taught not to get lost in the language, or maybe it's because the performer captured the early sarcasm and the later sorrow, but listening to this audiobook completely changed my idea about this story. At its root, its about several people lying to each other and themselves, but somehow, they are the most human people in their worlds.As a note to high school teachers planning to assign this book to students, please do not ask students to interpret the metaphors. I lost so much of the wonderful language on my first reading because I knew my teacher would ask me to explain what had happened. When reading it for fun, I got lost in the imagery and fell in love with the short experience. I guess this book is proof that high school English classes can turn the most wonderful works of fiction into a bland and lifeless learning exercise."
1984,Brent Vincent,"An absolute classic and one of the most efficient and well put together novels I have ever read. I completely understand why some don't like it, but I love it so. It's just gets so much out of what it has and is so smart about it that I have nothing but respect for it. On top of that the themes it covers are still relevant today in many ways. Economic difficulties and differences will always be a hot topic, especially in relation to the American Dream. Work hard and you can attain all that makes you happy. The Great Gatsby challenges this notion with great ability and a grim ending. I feel I just can't properly describe how wonderful this book is in practically every regard."
1985,G.P. Merwede,"Almost every high-school student has read The Great Gatsby (perhaps except the South as they tend to ban books such as ‘Elmo Counts To Ten’). It is a literary classic – recognized as #2 in the 100 best novels of the 20th-century – and it is commonly considered Fitzgerald’s finest piece (published when he was 29-years old).Gatsby deftly captures the Roaring 20′s in all of its affluence and excessiveness by detailing the bright-burning supernova that is Jay Gatsby. Wealthy and infamous, Gatsby throws lavish parties at his West Egg, Long Island mansion in order to capture the attention of Daisy Buchanan. The novel’s narrator, Nick Carraway, becomes embroiled in the drama that unfolds throughout the nine chapters, leading to a climax that has been rehashed and redone by novels, movies, and television shows.For those who read The Great Gatsby in the past and those who have yet to turn its pages, I suggest opening its cover and unfurling a story that is, and always be, applicable to human life in any century."
1986,Kelsey Tyrrell,I read this book for the fourth quarter because I never had the chance to read it before the movie came out. This book is so much better than the movie because of the added details and descriptions of characters and scenes that may have been shortened or even left out. This classic actually made me emotional toward the ending. F. Scott Fitzgerald is such a talent and this book will live on in history for many years to come. I'm practically obsessed with this book. The romance presented in it is so touching. I recommend everyone should read this book and not just go see the movie because you are truly missing out on a great experience. 
1987,Matt,"Recently I made a vow to broaden my reading horizons outside of the whole GBB (Gibson/Burroughs/Ballard) thing and try to throw in a ""classic"" every now and then. I began with Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby'.Obviously, the problem with attempting a review of a classic piece of literature is that everything that could be said about it most likely has already been said by someone much more eloquent at some point. The prose has a way of drawing the reader in with it's beauty. This is a given as that is what Fitzgerald is known for. Modern readers would probably question the strategy of the story being told in the first person by Nick Carraway. I have personally never met anyone in the world of finance who was known for their beautiful prose style. The other obvious observation that pretty much everyone has made is that the story shapes our modern perception of what life was like for the richer segment of the population in 1920's American society. I'm torn over the depictions of the characters Tom, Daisy, and Jordan Baker. On the surface, what we have here are vapid, Paris Hilton type personalities. My opinion is that Carraway, our very eloquent finance guy, may have assigned his own set of deeper perceptions and emotions to people who may not be that in touch with themselves. The problem with nostalgia for eras that one has never lived through is that it is easy to slip into the thinking that there were no Paris Hilton types living in those ""good ole days"". I'm saying there were and we get a look at them here.The moral of the story is one that hopefully all guys under the age of eighteen have already figured out. Don't put a love interest on a pedestal or pine for them after they have already moved on. I guess a secondary moral would be don't run over people with automobiles. My version of the book also contains an interesting afterword about the cover art of the book. This piece, by Francis Cugat, appears on most reprints of the book. It was evidently shown to Fitzgerald during a rewrite, and may have even been incorporated into the story to some extent.Basically everyone should read this book, if for no other reason than to look good at uptight cocktail parties where people are trying to discuss literature. Trust me, if you try to discuss 'Naked Lunch' at one of these parties you are going to get met with a mix of scorn and fear, and everyone will talk about you being on ""the dope"" after you leave. "
1988,Ian,"Great Gatsby might be my favorite book of all time. I enjoy all the details included; the women fawning over the real books and Gatsby staring of into the distance at the green light over the harbor. More than the little events in the novel I like how the entire novel serves as a reformatting of the classic love story. To some degree GG can really be boiled down to Gatsby is so enamored with Daisy he would do anything to make her happy and Daisy is so enamored with society and wealth that she is only able to realize how much she loves Gatsby when she sees the wealth he has accumulated. Really I love this book because it forces me to question the motives of every character to acknowledge that in real life love stories are not the valiant meeting the pure and are in fact many times the opposite. Finally, I like the perspective in which the story is told, Nick being a complete outsider allowed me to not to form a connection with any of the characters but instead to see them for how they actually are."
1989,Melinda,"I hate Daisy. I hate Tom. I think Nick might turn out okay. And I definitely can't figure out why Gatsby is so great. When fiction makes me respond so viscerally, I know it's good stuff."
1990,Tara,"Definitely in my Top 5 list. Everytime I read it, I discover a new feeling the book taps into. "
1991,Guido,"Gatsby ha un sogno - una fioca luce lontana lo invita a cercare di ricreare il passato. Per essere precisi, Gatsby vuole ritrovare soltanto un frammento di quel passato, un amore perduto a causa della sua passata condizione sociale; desidera portarlo nel presente e farlo durare. La sua nuova ricchezza lo aiuta: organizza feste colossali a casa sua, alle quali i ricchi newyorchesi si recano con la speranza di poterlo finalmente conoscere. Ignorando l'origine della sua fortuna si lasciano drogare dal suo alcool e, drogati, bisbigliano alle sue spalle varie ipotesi sul suo passato: assassino? contrabbandiere? spia tedesca? - e Gatsby non fa che puntare, deciso, verso il suo desiderio - qualcosa che nessun comune mortale può permettersi, la correzione di un rimpianto; come cercare di far tornare a galla il relitto di una nave affondata secoli fa.Il suo vicino di casa, Nick Carraway, è un povero agente di borsa; viene ben presto invitato alle feste e attraverso i suoi occhi osserviamo il trionfo del lusso e dell'opportunismo, le varie forme di prostituzione sociale, l'enorme difetto di umanità di tutte quelle persone che sperano di migliorare la propria condizione partecipando ai vizi del loro ricco e misterioso ospite. Le loro conoscenze sono persone dell'alta borghesia, tutte con le medesime ambizioni, le stesse fragilità che le rendono intoccabili: coppie di sposi che si tradiscono a vicenda, single che competono per frivolezze, capricci, vanità.Aggiungere dettagli sugli altri personaggi e sulle loro vicende rovinerebbe la trama: è un romanzo breve e intenso, e chi lo legge merita di poterlo vivere fino in fondo. Dal mio punto di vista, credo di aver trovato Nick Carraway ancora più interessante di Gatsby: perché sembra un conservatore e un moralista, lui che critica con tanto sarcasmo i vizi degli altri; mentre Gatsby appare come l'uomo nuovo, l'esempio di una generazione corrotta ma saldamente idealista, legata alla perdizione ma anche al sogno - e invece secondo me è Nick il vero rivoluzionario, non in grado di anticipare o evitare la tragedia ma comunque consapevole dei propri limiti, anche negli affetti: capace di rinunciare a qualcuno pur di interrompere una farsa, un gesto che Gatsby, vero signore della falsità, non saprebbe imitare. Gatsby secondo me non è il simbolo dell'idealismo di una nuova generazione, ma l'ultimo rappresentante di quella vecchia: quella delle guerre, della celebrazione delle apparenze, del lusso e dell'ingiustizia sociale. Dovremmo sempre sperare di avere con noi più Nick, e meno Gatsby.Il modo in cui questa storia è narrata, attraverso le parole di Nick, la rende indimenticabile: resta il desiderio di riviverla - di provare a capire un po' di più - ma anche di rivedere i luoghi nei quali si svolge: dalla luce sul mare delle prime sere di giugno alle foglie d'autunno nell'acqua della piscina, passando per garage costruiti tra mucchi di cenere e anonimi alberghi di lusso; la prosa di Fitzgerald regala infiniti piccoli dettagli a chi ama leggere. La sua generazione è in questo libro, ma dal mio punto di vista sarebbe riduttivo pensarlo soltanto come un cimelio dell'""Età del jazz"". Forse, in modo un po' banale, potrei affermare di aver scelto il momento giusto per leggerlo: in questo libro ho trovato la prima interpretazione davvero convincente, tagliente e crudele, della mia età."
1992,Veronikah,"I finally read The Great Gatsby!A good quick read, The Great Gatsby is a book filled with interesting places and characters. Gatsby being my favourite, haha!It took me a bit to get used to the writing (much more... ""flowery"" than the writing of the book I read previously) but once I did I read it in a breeze. Being told from Carraway's PoV our vision of the world and the people isn't complete, whatever we imagine and whatever we think is somehow affected by that. But don't get me wrong, I always love to read books written in 1st person, they have a different taste. I don't know what more to say, it's not like this book is recent and NEEDS lots of meaningful reviews.I can say, however, that I dislike Tom Buchanan a lot. A. LOT. He was a brute jerk. Unfortunately for me Carraway didn't feel the way I did and Tom never won a punch in the face.And then there's the other side of the coin: Gatsby. I loved this flawed but good-hearted guy. I found his personality, his attitude with Carraway and his love for Daisy so interesting and adorable. I love the fact that he never forgot about his roots, that was the final proof that he was a kind man.It made me sad to see that despite his richness and his fame and his past that no one but his servants, Nick and Mr. Gatz (Jay's father) came to his funeral. Not even Daisy appeared. I was so sad when I read that part. No one from those Nick contacted came to Jay's funeral, no one cared enough about him to pay him on last visit.I found Nick and Jay's friendship a very sweet and true relationship. Carraway was the best friend Gatsby could have ever asked.Oh look, I ended up saying a lot more XD"
1993,Alexander Seifert,"I really enjoyed the Great Gatsby. I'm not even sure why, but there's just something about the book that continues to resonate with me, even after a decade, a re-read, and watching a decent film adaptation. How does one not wind up sympathizing with Jay Gatsby by the end of the book? To me, he is a tragic figure. A man who has dedicated himself wholly to being something better only to find out that something he cherished deeply is as hollow as the jazz-age society in which he lives.A wonderful book that captures the spirit of America in the 1920s. Such a wonderfully facscinating period of our history."
1994,Lynda Schmidt,Each time I read this book I enjoy it more and more. Can't wait to discuss with the group!
1995,Deb,I liked this book so much that I want to put it in a cloud and push it around.
1996,Camille Madion," ""The Great Gatsby"" is one of the most fascinating pieces of literature I have ever read. It tells the story of an extremely wealthy man in the 1920's and his undeniable and irrevocable love for a woman that can can never truly be his. Heavy characterization and detailed imagery transport the reader back in time to the Jazz Age where you get a glimpse of what life was like - the roaring parties, the music, the clothing, and the people. ""The Great Gatsby"" is also filled with life lessons: through reserving judgements, we are open to the wonders of the world, and that you can never and should never try to rewrite the passed, but move on with the future, etc. The sentence structure and diction in the book are amazing, as well. An example of this is: ""Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering, I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life"" (Fitzgerald). Here, the author could just have said that he was an outsider and an insider in this way of life, attracted and repelled to and from the never ending pleasures that people find in life, but he chooses to say that it this way. There are many examples of this throughout the story - when the author says things in this majestic way and makes you think and look into your own self.  I loved ""The Great Gatsby"" and I would recommend it to anyone fourteen and older, my reasons being that the language used is difficult to understand and there is some mature content. I am rating this story with five out of five stars because I find it flawless - there is nothing in the book that I have to complain about. In the end, this is a classic that will go down in history as one of the best books ever written. "
1997,Vanessa,"”He had one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced, or seemed to face, the whole external world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself.”This novel has been sitting in my mind for a very long time, nipping at my conscious and forcing me to go out and buy it from the store, only that is a lie as I ordered it online. In hindsight I am glad I waited that extra time to read it, because it only made the experience ten times more amazing.The story of Gatsby, as told by Nick Carraway had the ability to enter my mind and stay with me for a great deal of time. The wonderful words of Fitzgerald are something that I had never previously experienced and I couldn’t be more delighted. It’s one of the first novels I have read and felt like picking it up again and re-reading, just for my own pleasure. I grew fond of the characters, despite their very obvious flaws that obviously make light of the sheer need and determination of people to achieve their ‘American Dream’ and made light of the complete loss of morality when striving to achieve this dream. The discussion of love, memory, wealth and social class throughout the novel challenged many thoughts held by many living during the time, making The Great Gatsby a truly fantastic novel (in my personal opinion).V."
1998,Dee,"Re-read June 2013I don't know what I was thinking. This book is sensational.5 starsOld review from 2010:The Great Gatsby. Another one for the can't believe it's taken me this long to read it category. It's short. I liked that. And the writing is impressive. Lines like: 'On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore, the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby's house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn.' Love it. And: 'Her voice was full of money.' Clever. I can see that it's packed with symbolism. There seems to be a lot of yellow: the orchestra plays 'yellow cocktail music'. The twins in their yellow dresses. I've read somewhere that yellow represents corruption or something. Like the yellow in the heart of ... a Daisy. Also, there's repetition of the colour green. Money? The American Dream? The 'green light, the orgastic future that recedes before us'. And then there are eyes. The big eyes on the billboard advertisement. The man with 'owl eyes' in Gatsby's library. Hmm. The eyes of God?Ok, I'll have to admit that I was a little bored. It seems people either hate this book or love it. I imagine that those who hate it are merely reacting to those who love it (or to the fact that they were forced to read it at high school). I'll just fit myself somewhere in the middle. Will probably, if I ever get around to it, have to read it a few more times to fully appreciate Fitzgerald's genius. I can sense the genius lurking. I just can't quite grasp it. But I do feel like this is one of those rare cases where critical analysis might actually up the enjoyment factor for me. (Or, maybe, just letting someone who's already done the analysis tell me the highlights.) So, for now, The Great Gatsby, you get 3.5 stars. With the hope for more, I guess."
1999,Nico Cheze,"The Great Gatsby is an exhilarating novel set in the 1920's following a man named Nick Carraway. As the novel progresses we learn about a man named James Gatsby, who is the mysterious wealthy neighbor of Nick Carraway.I would highly recommend this novel because of its enticing plot line and the simplicity of the text. The novel provides many insightful takeaways for its readers, like that our future lies in the content of our past. The novel also shows that love is both cruel and unforgiving, and that wealth and popularity does not follow you in death."
2000,Jill,"This book was really good! In a way, the ending took me by surprise, yet at the same time, I kind of expected it, if that makes sense. Although I really liked the book, it did leave me feeling depressed and thinking about what truly makes people happy in life."
2001,York,"Se trata de uno de los libros más hermosos que uno puede toparse en su vida. Lo leí hace casi una década y no me significó mucho, nada más allá de una narración extraordinaria en una historia de obsesión por una idea de amor e idealización.Ahora, tantos años después, con más vidas rotas y la absurda noción de lo que se supone ser adulto y convertirse en ""alguien"" logro comprender mejor de qué demonios habla Fitzgerald. El Gran Gatsby es una hermosa historia de sutilezas, lo que lees en el texto es una pequeña parte de toda la magnitud, de todo el peso y dolor que carga cada personaje.Gatsby más que una fantasía, un villano o una víctima es una voz de todo aquello que siempre hemos querido aspirar a lograr, y no se trata del lujo o la riqueza, sino de amar, y vivir hasta sus últimas consecuencias el poder de nuestra devoción. A una imagen, a un sueño, a unos ojos, a un nombre.Como una suerte de Ícaro moderno, con el corazón roto. Un texto hermoso que a un siglo se mantiene vigente.Eviten la película de Baz Luhrmann es una mierda."
2002,Jacob,"Money, the root of all evil as it’s commonly known, serves as both a backdrop and a demon that looms over the heads of almost everyone and everything within The Great Gatsby. It comes as a fact of life, a hurdle to be surpassed, a means of enlightenment, even a personality trait. The Great Gatsby is the perfect example of how, without compromise, one’s dreams and the pursuit of them can corrupt the very thing which one seeks to attain. Refusing to adhere to reality and adapt to the constant shifting flow of life can warp any and every dream in any and every one to but a shadow of what it once was, turning affluence and affection into inner impoverishment and idolatry. I can say with complete certainty that this book will forever change how you approach your goals and see things from a different perspective.	The Great Gatsby tells the story of nostalgic and tragic love between Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan, two people born on opposite sides of the poverty line whose lives are so despairingly distant yet intertwined so elegantly, as seen through the eyes of the narrator and protagonist, Nick Carroway. Throughout Nick’s stay in New York, his beliefs, his patience, and his perspective are all tested as he’s tossed into the middle of a plot to reunite Daisy and Gatsby after being apart for 5 years. This is a troublesome undertaking mainly due to the fact that while Gatsby was amassing his fortune to woo Daisy into marriage, she was ironically married off to an opulent Polo player from Chicago, Tom Buchanan. At first Nick is suspicious of Gatsby, as everyone is, but then Nick begins to take a liking towards Gatsby for his unbridled optimism and his generosity towards him. We see that throughout the book as events transpire and the situation changes, he grows tired and somewhat frustrated with Gatsby and his almost outright refusal to see the reality of the situation. This highlights a theme that I find so tragically poetic, that the refusal to adapt to life’s shifting flow can not only affect yourself but also those around you, even your closest friends.	Even when these dreams are finally achieved, they can often fall short of the gargantuan fantasy crafted by the imagination. One of my favorite lines in the entire book says it quite nicely, “One autumn night, five years before,…His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. At his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.” He knew that as soon as he got a taste of the love Daisy had to give, he will never again be free until he has it all to himself. This does, however, chain him to her affections. He craves her smile and her approval of him, and begins to think the only way to secure himself in her heart or be considered anywhere near her equal is to acquire a fortune with which to provide for her and prove his own worth. 	I could go on and on about the dazzling imagery, the beautiful language, and the vivid world of New York in the Jazz Age for at least 8 more pages; However, I’ll save you the trouble, you may not be keen to read 5 paragraphs about the symbolism of a green light bulb so I’ll just reiterate why The Great Gatsby is an absolute must-read. It will undoubtedly change your perception of people and the pursuit of happiness, giving you an outside perspective on how the failure to adapt and acclimate to changes in your life can lead to detrimental consequences. I can’t tell you all the reasons I love this book, so just save yourself the trouble of guessing and find out for yourself."
2003,Moa,"Wow. Such a beautiful, beautiful story!It was a little slow in the beginning, but when I finally got into it i flew through the pages! The language is so beautiful and it leaves you thinking. I did see the movie with DiCaprio before reading this, so the faces of the characters were set in my head. But it didn't ruin anything, the book allowed you to take bigger turns and draw the rest in your mind.And, of course, the book was better than the movie! The movie was a beautiful peace of art, but this book created art in your mind. LOVED IT!"
2004,Angela Shrum,"I admit - it took me 31 years to read this book, and that was only after I saw ""The Great Gatsby"" (mostly for Leo) and fell into a silent awe.This is an incredible book simply because it makes me feel things. First, adoration, and then (and mostly), PURE. RAGE.I can only process so much at the moment, so my review isn't going to be full. In fact, I mainly want to talk about Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan. Really, though, mostly Daisy. Because I've got to get this out.***MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD******MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD******MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD***Apologies for this rant in advance...This novel makes me FEEL too many things. Now that I've reached the end, I am seriously about to burn this bitch. (Not really, no worries!) I love it and I hate it that much... Better, I love it BC I hate it this much. F. Scott Fitzgerald has mucked up my emotions.I haven't felt this much rage about a book in some time! Seriously... I wanna flick Daisy freakin Buchanan in the mother-flippin eyebrow! I hate how Gatsby was so in love with her and she just didn't give two shits enough to care. Her true colors come bleeding through. UGH. I feel enraged and utterly disappointed in her. She's such a selfish, shallow, spineless, ungrateful piece of work! At first, I felt sorry for her. And then I was like, okay, she'll get some redeeming qualities in her... I see, so vividly, Gatsby's love and devotion for her. I am in awe of it. I will root for them just because he loves her so much that I love his love for her. And then boom. I fucking hate her. She just wanted attention and more money. She's a coward. She's cruel. She betrays Gatsby, uses him, drives his reputation in the mud, and then abandons him after his death?! Dear God. I cannot even process.I get that it's a tragedy and not a love story. I see that now. But when I was reading, I thought...IDK what the fuck I thought was gonna happen but JFC... It's like ripping out my heart and stomping it then burning it then picking it up and eating it and then shitting it out and burning it again. ...What I would give to be looked at like he looked at her, and adored. I want a freakin' green light shining across the water every single night just for me! I mean, could you imagine?! But Daisy... again, selfish and cruel. What more could she have wanted? Oh yeah, that's right. Everything. Even his GD soul. Gatsby's love and dedication is quick to become blurry bc he's dipped too far under, completely blind, begging for his next breath of her. He's consumed by her -- the idea, the dream, the reality; he doesn't care. He just wants IN. He dreams of her, yearns for her, craves her, and never regrets her. He convinces himself that the past can be returned and/or rewritten. Gatsby may have many flaws and a shady past, but all in all, he's noble, and kind, naively blind by the thought of loving this one woman for the rest of his life. Gatsby has made Daisy his entire purpose. And I don't know if he loved the idea of her more than the actual Daisy, herself, but it didn't matter. He was committed to her, in some way, shape, or form, from day one. The dude bought the biggest house, and the brightest car, and held parties every night with people he didn't give a fuck about, and they didn't care about him, just for her. He stood at the dock and reached for her, night after night. Then, worse, he died keeping her secret. He died protecting her. Yet, she remained a raging bitch. Like, ""Oh well, carry on.""And I hate her.And it's not okay.It's like my mind cannot boggle that kind of unrequited love.God....IDK. My friend, Justin, brought up some good points to me just now, when discussing this. Maybe it's the portrayal of struggles between societies' perception of men and women, especially in the 20s. Is Daisy THIS appalling to me, just because she is a woman who did the hurting? Through most of modern literacy the majority of antagonists are portrayed my men and maybe it's trained me to deem them that way. Women are supposed to be the caring and nurturing. Is it the shock factor that has me so jumbled, or maybe the dark truth that society is indeed full of these type of people, both male and female, who are emotionally parasitic to others? What has made me this riled up? I don't know. But it's a hell of a good story because of the impact on my heart, and I have to give it credit where credit is due. So that's why I give this 5 stars."
2005,Yara,"As most of you will have picked up on by now, I am currently taking a class on the literary canon and have been rereading a number of books that I haven’t read since I was a teenager. It has been absolutely fascinating to see how my opinions and tastes have changed, how I am both more and less tolerant now than I was before, and how, after almost six years at university, I pick up so much more on style and symbolism these days. It’s been an interesting journey, and a great relief to know that my education so far has actually taught me a thing or two about literature. I won’t have built up a massive debt for nothing, hurray!I first picked up The Great Gatsby at the age of seventeen and it has been one of my personal favourites ever since, which is why I was a bit anxious to dive in again. What if the writing no longer impresses me now that I am a more seasoned reader? Will Fitzgerald still be able to win me over? The answer to that question is a whole-hearted yes. If anything, knowing what I know now, I appreciate The Great Gatsby even more.I found myself rolling my eyes at Nick Carraway’s notoriously unreliable narration, cackling with laughter when Gatsby panicks over seeing Daisy again and sends his people over to stuff Nick’s house full of flowers, and letting out a melancholy sigh once I’d reached the final page. The Great Gatsby is a textbook example of a writer who knows his craft and is in perfect control of every single detail. It is still read in schools and universities across the world because it is a great example of symbolism: if anything, Gatsby is full of meaning. Every single syllable is there for a reason, there is not a superfluous word in the text (which is, perhaps, why it is such a slim volume). Rereading this novel today, I discovered my love for Fitzgerald’s writing all over again, which is one of the most wonderful experiences in the world. Gatsby and I have renewed our vows, and it seems that time, the novel’s real antagonist, has yet to come between us."
2006,Afifah Widya,"""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they made..."" (page 191)Except that some mess just couldn't be wiped out. Like Gatsby, and how he met his downfall.Tragically beautiful. And sad. And moving. This bites our conscience about world and how classes there can never quite mingle. They probably wouldn't, although one could always hope... just like Gatsby, yearning towards his green-light who failed to send him flowers in the end: Daisy."
2007,Brittany,"“The loneliest moment in someone’s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.”Written in 1925, The Great Gatsby explores themes such as idealism, resistance to change, and social upheaval creating a portrait of the Roaring Twenties or the ""Jazz Age."" The Great Gatsby is known as a cautionary story about the American Dream. The Great Gatsby is a beautifully written novel. F. Scott Fitzgerald did a fantastic job writing this novel because there are no loose ends. Everything ties together. I love this novel and it will stick with me for a very long time to come. I simply cannot understand why anyone dislikes this novel. I guess those people just don't see the beauty in this novel nor do they have any idea what good literature actually is. For Christ's sake, this is a classic for a reason people! Come on. ***BEWARE: There are spoilers in this review! Read with caution!***The Great Gatsby takes place over one summer in 1922. Nick Carraway, a graduate of Yale and World War I veteran from the Midwest, narrates the novel. Nick begins the novel by giving us some advice - given to him by his father - about not criticizing others. But-but what if they're lying, backstabbers or *gasp* psychopathic killers? Now, time to meet the cast: Nick's second cousin that's once removed Daisy Buchanan; her aggressive, overly protective, territorial husband Tom Buchanan; and Jordan Baker. Jordan, who's a girl of course, becomes Nick's love interest.Because you know why, old sport? She's the only girl around who is - I don't know - NOT HIS COUSIN. The Buchanan's live in the upscale East Egg. I'm talking about Long Island, New York here in the 1920s, I said the 1920s folks! However, Nick lives in West Egg, which is where the less elite reside. Soon to come, we (the readers) and Nick are soon to be fascinated by Mr. Jay Gatsby. Jay Gatsby is a wealthy and mysterious man who owns a huge mansion next door to Nick. Gatsby spends much of his evenings standing on his beautiful green lawn staring at the mysterious green light from across the bay. Oookay... Is this guy a whackadoodle? Tom decides to take Nick to the city to show him his mistress. Myrtle Wilson, Tom's mistress, is of course, can you guess? Drumroll... MARRIED. George, Myrtle's husband, is a passive, average joe working class man who owns an auto garage. He is somehow oblivious that his wife is cheating on him. He has no idea that his beloved wifey is getting some umm...side dick...er I mean some lovin' from anotha man. Come on George! Your wife is cheating on you! WAKE UP. How can you not see it? Nick, who actually has some good ol' values that were instilled in him when he was a child, is not too pleased with Tom. Back in West Egg, this Gatsby dude is throwing absolutely lavish, killer parties. These are EXTRAGANT parties, ladies and gents. The type of party where everyone and their brother comes to get drunk. I mean, these parties are huge. They put the 'party' in the phrase party til you puke. Nick finally meets the mystery man at one of his Saturday night parties and befriends him. Nick also starts spending time with Jordan, Ooo are we getting serious here? who is a bit cynical, but she's still loveable! Continuing on, Gatsby introduces Nick to Meyer Wolfsheim who is Gatsby's business partner. Hmm. I smell a rat! Gatsby then tells Nick, through Jordan, that he and Daisy had a lovey dovey thing going on before he went off to war and she married Tom. When marrying Tom, Daisy suffers a terrible episode of cold feet and drinks whiskey in a bath tub. Damn it woman! Don't do this on your wedding day! Gatsby decides he wants Daisy back, and he recruits Nick to help him reunite the two by making it look like an accident. Nick agrees, and he executes the plan. Gatsby and Daisy are reunited, ""Reunited and it feels so good. Reunited cause we understood"" and they start an affair. Everything goes along okay until Tom meets Gatsby. Tom does not like Gatsby and starts researching his affairs. But Nick on the other hand, he knows all about it. Gatsby grew up in a poor, non-educated family...that is, until he met a man named Dan Cody. Mr. Cody took Gatsby in as a companion and taught him how to act rich. Dan is not the one who left Gatsby the money though. The big action goes down in the city though when Tom has it out with Gatsby over who gets to be with Daisy. Gatsby is called out as a bootlegger and Daisy isn't allowed to leave her husband. Everyone goes home, probably in a crappy mood and Myrtle, Tom's mistress, is struck and killed by Gatsby's car. Both Gatsby and Daisy are in this car, by the way. Gatsby reveals to Nick that Daisy was driving, but Gatsby decides he is going to take the blame for it to protect Daisy. Aww, what a gentleman. He doesn't want his love to get in trouble. How sweet. Tom, however, throws Gatsby under the bus - well, at least the pissed off husband - by telling George where to find Gatsby. *Bang!* *Bang!* George shoots Gatsby, and then he turns the gun on himself. You poor doomed bastard Gatsby. If only you hadn't taken the blame... You could've been a good man. You could've lived the life you wanted. Daisy and Tom leave, leaving their messes behind. Nick, who has is pretty much fed up with these damn people in West Egg, decides to break up with Jordan in a cold way. Think about being broken up with via text message. Yeah, it's like that. Nick arranges Gatsby's funeral, which is - sadly - did not have a high attendee rate. However, Gatsby's dad shows up to his son's funeral with some more 411 on his past. Nick stands on Gatsby's beautiful lawn staring at the green light like Gatsby did (which, by the way, that green light is just Daisy's house across the bay.) Nick makes the conclusion that nostalgia just ends up forcing us to constantly relive the past. What a sad ending. That ending made me tear up, and feel depressed. But it's one of the greatest endings there is. I love how you can picture Nick just standing there on Gatsby's lawn staring at the green light. I think that is just a beautiful ending. This story is amazing, and it's not appreciated by people like it should be. I believe The Great Gatsby to be F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece. Now, I shall leave you with this...“So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”"
2008,Stella,"Not sure how I got through high school without reading this, but I’m so glad I’ve read it now. Wow. This is a masterpiece! “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.” "
2009,Sarah Moore,"Fitzgerald's writing is very thoughtful and imagery is great. The first time, I read the book quickly and without analyzing the descriptive yet not specific images created in this book. Re-reading it has really allowed me to be more aware of the way in which Fitzgerald writes his words. This story really seems as if it is told by Nick Carraway, the narrator of the story. The words make Nick become a real person. There are many moments of foreshadowing and metaphoric symbolism throughout the book. The first time I read it, I had gotten basic ideas of the book, but upon the second reading, I started to read in more detail and look for intentional choices of words and small moments. For example, some scenes that you may not think are important may become important to the ending. Books like this make more and more sense each time you read it, and the second time, I definitely enjoyed reading it. I was able to understand deeper concepts and ideas.The main recurring theme of not being able to repeat the past is something I really understood this time around in reading it. I never really understood this when I was younger and first wanted to read this, and now I figure probably because I never really thought about such ideas at a younger age. Now, with more experience and trying to understand life, I look at this book and see most of what Fitzgerald is writing down. The personality of characters are not unlike those of real people, therefore it is sensible to link them with such values and characteristics that they possess. The story moves in very well and is interesting to read with Fitzgerald's(or Nick's) choice of words. I really like foreshadowing in stories, and many different hints are hidden within this work that eventually come together at the end. I hope to re-read more books, and even this book, since it is more enjoyable and you WILL understand something new the next time around."
2010,Buhonicka,"I read this in high school, but I wanted to read it again before seeing the movie. The book was so much better than I remember; maybe, being older and more mature, I understood it better. However, I wish the book was 100 pages longer. It held my attention so well, I would have loved more to read. Also, I despise Daisy."
2011,Natalie Aminoff,"""You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together."" For me, this was the most important quote within the whole novel and really spoke to me more than any other sentence in the book. In the whole book, this was the one and only time that Gatsby ever received a positive compliment, the only time someone actually told him that he was good and he was worthy. Even with all the riches in the world, dazzling parties and elegant clothing, one of the things that really made Gatsby smile was when Nick, someone who he admired greatly, said something nice to him. The Great Gatsby is a story of hope and diminished dreams. The Great Gatsby is a story of being so close to your idea of heaven, yet not quite reaching out far enough to grab it, something that we can all relate to. The character of Jay Gatsby is the most complex yet one dimensional character that has ever been written. Although his only focus is his great love Daisy, there is so much more to him that the reader is never quite sure about, even at the end of the novel. There are many themes in this novel, such as the American dream, love and greed. But personally, the most significant aspect that I take from this novel is that it just takes one person to touch your life, and it only takes one person to carry your legacy. It is not his money, his house or even his love for Daisy that made Gatsby great. It is his everlasting, optimistic hope for the future that was his life support for so many years. This enduring desire for improvement was only noticed by his neighbour and confidante Nick Carraway, and it only took one person, Nick to memorialize Gatsby's pure hope into this novel, and that is what made him The Great Gatsby. "
2012,Julie Wilde,"I absolutely loved the Great Gatsby! This classic novel takes a closer look at the downfalls of the American dream, selfishness, betrayal, and love. I feel like I learned so much from reading it. It was interesting to analyze the various characters and their motives. A definite must read!"
2013,Jenny,"Gatsby is the living embodiment of the American Dream. If you ever read this book in class, you will hear this a lot. The Great Gatsby is a bit like marmite. Either you love it or you hate. Many people who hate it think that it's about delusions and superficial materialism. People who love it think about the beauty of hope and how in the right time and place, everything can be magic. But that's just my personal opinion.The main characters in this book can each be defined in very few words. Gatsby - A dreamer. Daisy - A gold digger. Tom - A sexist cheat. Jordan - A lying bitch. Nick - A snob. Dispite this, Jordan is actually one of my favourite characters, probably because she does what she wants and doesn't care about anyone else and she lies to protect herself. I like Nick too, and found it incredibly sad when he realised he had forgotton his 30th birthday because he was too absorbed in everyone else's life. I wish that there was always more of an emotional connection between Nick and Jordan as they never seemed that emotionally attached to each other, that part is never talked enough about in class. "
2014,Mỹ Khương,"This book is such a classic! Very well-written and full of all kinds of emotions: delight, despair and hope, which are not seperate but very well-blended in every single page and conversation. This book somehow changed my illusion about the fancies about the luxurious life in New York, by the way. Besides, this book is written in first narrative, which I think would be very useful for those who intend to write a personal statement for universities. All in all, The Great Gatsby is a must-read, if you haven't read it, grab the book and do right away, otherwise you'll regret it for the rest of your life."
2015,Shaylah Kloska Paul,i re-read this a few months ago for the first time since i was 17 (and that was for a class and i don't think i ever even finished it) and i absolutely loved it. i love fitzgerald's subtleties in the dialogue and the personalities of the characters. and his descriptions of new york at night are gorgeous. this is a classic for a reason. now i need to read more fitzgerald.
2016,Devina,"I didn't think I'd like this as much as I'd previously thought, the classics genre often hint to a bore of a book, often but not always. The Great Gatsby is, in short, a tragic love story and you'll find here that a woman can spell ruin for a man, not that it's news. I can see why many before me consider this a great book. Fitzgerald captured a drop of human nature during the time of easy money and high living in beautiful prose. Daisy wanted what any woman wanted; security, and for her that meant a wealthy husband. She could have waited for Gatsby but she lacked the faith. I doubt that she actually loved the man. I both despised her and pity her. Why should she not want the best for herself, but at what cost? Did she even love Tom? Nah, she had no affection to anyone but herself and not so deep down inside she's probably not really happy. Perhaps she and Tom were a perfect match after all. An egocentric pair, those two.Jay Gatsby was a romantic, one that was chasing a dream that had ran far past him, and the dust that lie in its wake only spurred him on to give chase, by any means. It makes me sad because he deserved better. Given all that is past, I wonder if he'd believe it was all worth it. I would agree with Nick that he, Gatsby, was worth much more than the rotten lot of them put together. He wanted nothing more than to be loved by a woman who he thought to be in love with him. At the end of the day, his dream was pure and simple and human, to live well and to love more."
2017,Annika Park,"If the Jazz age was going to have a funeral, the American dream would be the one crying over the grave and Gatsby would be the one reading out the Eulogy."
2018,Jenny (Reading Envy),"Best last line in a novel, I'd say."
2019,Matthew Flannery,"Fantastic. I am sad that high school students are made to read this book. Personally, I needed to live a little more than my then-16-year-old self to really feel the book's emotions. Nick Carraway is past his most glamorous years and settled into adult life, which is all the more reason to find Gatsby's money and partying intriguing."
2020,Jerome,"Before reading this book now, I thought I'd read it back while I was in school. I now believe I was mistaken, as there was way too much that was new to me than could logically be explained by just memories dimming with the passage of time. It mentioned St Olaf College, which is one of two colleges in what I consider to be one of my hometowns. I'm pretty sure that would have stuck. It also mentioned Kapiolani and the Punchbowl, which I became familiar with shortly after leaving high school, as it was my first permanent duty station during my time in the Corps. Granted, it's less likely that this would have stuck in my mind while reading the book in school, as I hadn't yet been there, but it's still a point that I think would have drawn at least some bit of recognition when I later walked those same places.Perhaps I read a Cliff Notes version, or heard someone else's book report or review, but I doubt now that I had ever read it in the past. And that's too bad.There is no doubt in my mind now why this book is considered a classic, and is loved by so many. The dialogue and interplay between the characters is exquisite. Seldom have I come across a book that, when reading a passage, I could picture it so vividly in my mind. While it doesn't take much for me to get lost in a book, his ability to draw those images so easily with mere words is unsurpassed in my experience.His penchant for skipping back and forth in time with his narrative is the only thing present in this book that would usually decrease my appreciation of a book, but even that was handled in such a manner as to not truly annoy me.I may give it a few years, but I will read this book again."
2021,Nikolas Deffigos,"This book is widely regarded as one of the best novels in American history, and rightly so. As a teenager, the characters are slightly older than I am but I can still relate to the different types of relationships in the novel and the struggle that it is to maintain these relationships. The takeaways from this novel are that Nick is not necessarily the most reliable narrator, love (or the illusion of love) makes people do things they wouldn't normally do, and the yearning for our own green light has endured to this point and will continue to be the driving force behind humans for as long as we live on earth."
2022,Zoe,"What a wonderful piece of work. The Great Gatsby is such a timeless story told by Nick Carraway, man who moves to New York and lives next to the legendary Jay Gatsby. Everyone knows Gatsby but nobody actually knows him. As the story goes on, Nick is invited to one of Gatsby’s extravagant parties where they meet and have a little chat. Nick finds out that Gatsby and his distant cousin Daisy had a very romantic relationship before Gatsby had to leave for the war. But when he got back years later, Daisey had already married, and had a child. But now Gatsby wants to see Daisy again to see is they will still have anything left of their relationship. And that’s what they whole story is about, what happens when Gatsby and Daisy have their little fling together again, and how it affects each of them. Overall this book just pulls you in, you never want to put it down. The way Fitzgerald tells the story is just incredible, almost like a dream. I was sad when it was over because the ending is so unexpected and just breaks my heart. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a lighter fiction and tragedy novel. "
2023,Algernon,"note: may contain slight spoilers.---Movie adaptations are a good catalyst for pushing me to read (or in this case re-read) the novels that they are based on before I experience the content on the big screen. I read Gatsby a long time ago, I was probably too green for it, still believing in the Big Dream - that you can succeed if you apply yourself diligently and that rooms at the top are available for anyone determined enough. In fact, despite the differences in style, Jay Gatsby and Joe Lampton (the hero of John Braine's Room at the Top) are cut from the same cloth : smart, good with words, smooth with the ladies, mesmerized by a glittering high society manfisted in the feminine ideal: ""Her voice is full of money,"" he said suddenly.That was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money--that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals' song of it ... high in a white palace the king's daughter, the golden girl ... There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.  Jay Gatsby is not the only one chasing the American Dream. Nick Carraway is coming to New York to learn about money and to start on a succesful banking career. He gets caught himself in the net of one of the white butterflies who flutter from one party to another, fron one opulent saloon to another. Jordan Baker herself hides behind a bored and detached exterior a ruthless determination to go to the top in her golfing career. Myrtle Wilson seeks escape from a dreary marriage by parroting the affectation of the rich through the shabby parties she throws in her town apartment.On the other side of the gulf are the pursued, the ones who have already achieved the Dream, either by birth or by the right connections. Tom Buchanan lives the good life, looking down on mere mortals, turning up his nose at the excesses of the 'noveau riches' partying in Gatsby's mansion and pontificating about white supremacy and manifest destiny. Daisy Buchanan is harder to pin down, as the love of Jay Gatsby seems to paint her in a more favorable light. But she is as hollow as the rest of the self-centered crowd she has chosen to join, seeking only new trills to relieve the boredom of her hollow ideal life ( ""What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon?"" cried Daisy, ""and the day after that, and the next thirty years?"" ) . In the end, Tom and Daisy are made for each other, united in their self sufficiency and lack of empathy: They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made ... One of the reasons of the book success I think lies in the dictum to new writers :'write about the things you know!' . Scott Fitzgerald knew the wild parties in the New York and environs intimately, and the way he has captured the spirit of the Roaring Twenties makes the book almost a historical document. I can't help feeling that a lot of his contemporaries recognized themselves among the wild partygoers or in the patrons of the speakeasy clubs. The love for the liveliness and the miriad possibilities of the metropolis also shines through the text: Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life. As the book often deals in contrasting imagery, symbols and metaphors, the glittering life of the city is surrounded by a a veritable hell where the less fortunate move in endless dread: This is a valley of ashes--a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. A second reason for the success of the novel is for me the language used, the rhythm and the elegance of phrasing, the poetic imagery, the polished feel that is probably the result of numerous rewrites and of many difficult choices an author unsure of himself made in order to reach such clarity and concision coupled with such emotional intensity.While Jay Gatsby is working very well at pushing the plot forward by keeping in the background in the opening chapters and maintaing secrecy about his past and his source of money, I found myself more interested in the personality of Nick Carraway. As the narrator of the novel, he is most of the time a neutral observer, a recorder of events who tries to stay uninvolved in the dramas unfolding around him. He witnesses Tom Buchanan infidelities, he brings Jay and Daisy together, he is both inside and outside the story, as I already mentioned in an earlier quote. I was rooting for him right from the opening pages: Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth. Coming himself from an old Midwest family, still believing in the basic goodness of his fellow men, I see him as the alternative path to the hollow American Dream, one that reminds me of the later works of Frank Capra - of small places where everybody knows everybody and money are not the coin by which we judge fellow humans. He gets tempted, by the exuberant life of the city, by the 'clean' look of the sophisticated lady (Jordan), but I see his departure at the end not as a defeat, but as a return to a cleaner and truer world. He abandons the passive role of observer and gives the verdict on all those shallow souls: ""They're a rotten crowd,"" I shouted across the lawn. ""You're worth the whole damn bunch put together."" ---Having now also watched the Baz Luhrman movie over the weekend, I must say I was mostly disappointed in how it turned out. The script followed the source material well, but there really was no need for the 3D gimmick, and the whole violent colour pallette, shrill soundtrack, spastic editing and obvious CGI reminded me more of an MTV videoclip than the delicate and lyrical touch of Scott-Fitzgerald. Carey Mulligan and Leonardo di Caprio did well in their roles, the actors playing Myrtle and Tom also were convincing, but the girl playing Jordan was wooden and Tobey Maguire a fiasco. "
2024,Diane,"I almost hate to admit it, but I decided to re-read this at the urging of Stephen Colbert. I read it in high school 30+ years ago, and remembered the main characters and themes, but almost nothing of the plot. I'm certain I got more out of it this time, especially the way Fitzgerald constructed the plot to deliver on the themes: the pathetic futility of holding onto dreams past their expiration date, the almost callow self-absorption of people with too much money and too little purpose (other than to surround themselves with reminders of how much money they have). Re-reading the book in the wake of the Great Recession almost certainly colored my interpretation of it. When I read it for the first time, I understood it as a book about the 1920s, and it didn't really speak to the circumstances of the late 1970s (that I could see at age 16 or 17). Now I can see how timeless the book is. It's not about Americans of the Great War/Roaring 20s generation, it's about Americans of ANY generation. You could plunk these characters, their lives and their choices, into any period of American history and the the story would resonate."
2025,Marte Patel,"I first read this wonderful novel aged 17 when I did the IB Diploma back in 2000–2002. Quite recently I first saw the trailer for the new Baz Luhrmann adaptation coming out this Christmas and immediately decided that (a) I would like to see the film as I really enjoyed his Romeo + Juliet and (b) I wanted to re-read the novel before watching the film.It's nice being back home in Norway as I found I still had my old paper copy from my college days, a Penguin with RRP £3.99. :)I started re-reading the book yesterday evening and would have finished it in one sitting if I hadn't been sensible and finally gone to bed around midnight. I found that I loved it even more this time around - probably because I am older, my English is a lot better, and I've now experienced love myself. I love the writing, the structure, the way the chapters divide neatly into episodes, the plot, the characters, the way it evokes Long Island North Shore and New York in 1922... I loved everything about it.As an aside on the topic of the way I read in 2012, I found that I enjoyed this novel a lot more as I was able to look up unfamiliar words in the dictionary, find the places mentioned on Google Maps to get a sense of geography, and Google/Wikipedia the back story when I wanted to find out more about something or didn't understand a reference. I read this as a paper copy, but kept my tablet next to me whilst reading it. If I hadn't found the paper copy on my shelves I would have got the Kindle edition, which would have allowed me to read more seamlessly."
2026,Lily Chen,"I really like this book when I was in 10th Grade. Gatsby was an rich people, he had a very big house. All the people like to came to his house to have a party. however many years ago, he was not a rich person, he met Daisy and told her he was a rich person. Them he went to the World War One. When he came back he knew that Daisy has already married and she was not happy. So he wants to be a rich person and make Daisy came back. Few years later, he became a rich man, and he still love Daisy. But Daisy did not love him anymore. Daisy kill her husband's lover by accident, and Gatsby said he killed her. In the end lover's husband killed Gatsby. Gatsby did all the things he can do to make Daisy back but he never thought that Daisy did not like him. The only things she care about is money. His husband have money so he love him. Gatsby dreamed about that Daisy will be back. When I knew Daisy did not like the Gatsby, I feel really sad. Love make Gatsby loss his mind and did all the things wrong. "
2027,Elisabeth Barrett,"The epitome of the Great American Novel, it may suprise many readers to know that The Great Gatsby was not considered as such during Fitzgerald's lifetime. In fact, it took many years for this book to be established as one of the great works of American fiction. But it finally was, and for good reason.From the pitch-perfect settings of ""East Egg"" and ""West Egg"" (really not-so-thinly disguised Manhassett and Great Neck, New York, respectively) to the casual ennui of the characters (despite their Midwestern sensibilities) to the gorgeously evocative language, this masterpiece hits all the right notes. The ending of the novel is haunting, at once both hopeful and melancholy - the desire to believe in the American dream, coupled with the underlying understanding that any such dream does not actually exist.Much, much more than grade-school or high-school reading, this is a work for the mature adult who can appreciate the nuances and subtlety (not to mention the copious subtext) in the language. When you finally understand what Fitzgerald is getting at, it is impossible to forget his message."
2028,Jodi Crum,"One simple word that comes to mind when merely thinking about this book is...wow. F. Scott Fitzgerald just blows you away with this story filled with bright lights, sparkling fashion and most of all the endless love and hope Jay Gatsby has for Daisy.I'm sure that most people who have read this book could drone on and on about the love between Gatsby and Daisy. You cannot forget the most important character their is, Nick Caraway. Nick is the one who was in the middle of everything. He knew about Tom's affair, and Gatsby and Daisy's affair. Nick is someone who is in constant thought. He notices things that most people don't normally care about. That is why I instantly fell in love with him. He was someone who remained in the background. Until, that is, he was cordially invited to one of Gatsby's grand parties. That's when the adventure began.For the sake of people who have not read this book I will not continue on with talking about the book. I think that anybody who is more advanced than the average reader should read this book to understand the whole concept of this book. I did not think twice about giving this book a five out of five stars. The writing is just outstanding and it makes you feel right in the midst of everything. You will laugh with joy and cry from heartbreak reading this all time classic by F. Scott Fitzgerald. "
2029,Petra,"Tragic. Beautiful. A Love heptagon. The lives of these people are mainly shallow, self-indulgent lives with no substance, except for the Narrator. Not being rich, he lacked the self-indulgency of the others.The consequences of the actions of this group had far-reaching and tragic results.Beautifully written. Wonderfully told story. "
2030,Adrienne Roberts,"I read this book in high school, so I don't remember much of it. However, I do remember one line from the book that stuck with me to this day. It's when Daisy and her cousin are talking alone and she says that she hopes her daughter will grow up to be a fool. It is both a powerful and sad statement because she wants to shield her daughter from the evils that she has come to know, especially with her husband having an affair and she is powerless to do anything about it. But it is also sad because she wants her daughter to remain ignorant. That is a horrible fate to have. "
2031,Sweetsinsofashadow,"The great Gatsby was a book I chose for an assignment. I chose this book because of good reviews and the quotes I'd read online, quotes such as ""Gatsby looked at Daisy in a way that every young girl wanted to be looked at.”, “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.” and “I hope she’ll be a fool – that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.”.The book combines a lot of themes. The main one is love. Gatsby's life revolves around winning back the love of his life and deserving her.When I read the first chapter, I was disappointed. I was expecting a grand story about the great ""Gatsby"" but all I got were fragments of the life of some guy called ""Nick Carraway"". A guy who talks about himself and then pays a visit to his cousin Daisy. Nick didn't really strike me as a fascinating guy. I was confused and didn't really know what to expect from the rest of the book. I flew through the chapters and the character of Gatsby started to take shape. After one third of the book Nick and Daisy's part in the story became clear and the relevance of Nick's visit to Daisy became clear as well. When I closed the book, my expectations were definitely exceeded.It wasn't a superficial story at all, no everyday story about a rich guy or love. The story had a lot of layers: the past, the future, society, relationships... Layers I initially didn't expect but did enrich the experience.I thought the structure of the book was quite difficult. Because of the different story-lines, that switched between Nick's and Gatsby's point-of-view, it was very exhausting to read, especially in the beginning. The story regularly changed locations which created variety but also a bit of confusion.I thought it was an extraordinary good book. The book is situated in a very interesting period in the US. The story has a lot of depth and it's not black-and-white. It causes you to think about good and bad and the tragic ending will replay in your head for a long time. This is a book I'll definitely re-read."
2032,Jule,Can't even describe how much I adore this book and story. I came across this book due to having it on my to-read list for my English class and I'm thanking my English teacher again and again for making me read it. I have read it twice and I am still not bored and I think I might read it again. The book is short but that is not keeping the story for being powerfuland exquisite. All in all: pick it up because you won't regret it I promise! 
2033,Juli,"Tons of people told me this wasn't a good book but I absolutely loved it. One thing that does bug me is how anticlimactic Gatsby's death was. And I had seen a lot of posts saying that Gatsby is afraid of water and I didn't catch that in the book, or maybe it was merely a movie thing. I also enjoyed how Fitzgerald portrayed each of the characters and the diversity among them."
2034,Aimee Castro,"Gatsby hiso todo lo que puedo para conseguir fortuna y así enamorar a Daisy, cuando a ella sólo le importaba el dinero, divertirse... Gatsby no se dio cuenta de lo destructiva que ella podía llegar a ser, hasta el último momento y aun así Daisy no tuvo ni el mínimo respeto por todo lo que el hiso por ella... Un gran libro, te enseña sobre los amigos, que cuando en realidad crees tener mucho al último sólo se reduce a uno y a tu familia... el amor, que cuando estas ciegamente enamorado eso puede destruirte y llevarte an la ruina."
2035,Laura Grable,"Somehow, I have read this book twice before, but never really appreciated it. Listening to it on audio book, I noticed a lot more of the details, especially the beautiful language. This book feels so American and so modern. Jay Gatsby is reflected in so much our our current pop culture, like a reality TV star that everyone loves to hang out with, but no one really wants to know. I like that the characters in this book are real: they are honest, vulnerable and superficial. Overall, the third time around, this book finally resonated with me. I'm glad I gave it another shot. "
2036,Mark Taylor,"After reading this book three times it has slowly risen to become one of my all-time favourites. I did not instantly love it. On my first reading it irritated me. I remember feeling that Fitzgeralds writing was sort of... clunky and difficult. Only later did I realise I had not absorbed it properly. I had been going too fast and this was not the kind of book to be skimmed through.Fitzgerald finely crafted Carraways narrative in a way that resonated so deeply with me, I cannot immediately think of another author who is so capable. His talent is being able to express a great deal in few words, perfectly encapsulating a moment or a precise feeling. Certain pithy and concise sentences become permanently imprinted in my mind. I often found myself stopping every few paragraphs to take in or re-read what I had just read. (A few spoilers from this point...)Perhaps it's my error but I never really saw this as a story primarily about money, although it's undoubtedly an aspect for me it was more about the convergence of personalities. Gatsbys naive idealism, his ceaseless pursuit of Daisy as the last piece of his gilded jigsaw. The dangerous cocktail of Toms entitlement and boredom, restless and forever unable to appreciate what he has. Carraways open-mindedness that is slowly eroded and his apathy, taking Jordan for granted, eventually allowing her to slip away from him. This is a really great novel, one I will probably find myself re-reading every year or so.---As a side-note, there is a theory that Nick is gay, which I've considered but don't subscribe to. For one, he explicitly states he had a short affair with a woman from his office as well as the suggested past marriage. Although he likes Jordan on some level, he is wary of her deceitful behaviour and takes for granted her availability. There seems to be an implied thinking that if Nick was straight, he would jump at Jordan simply because she's both desirable and practically throwing herself at him. I think that's a rather dim view."
2037,Macy Murasky,"This story portrays the life a rich male named Gatsby during the roaring 20's. His life is almost perfect minus one thing, the women he loves, Daisy. He does everything in his power to get her back. Read the book and find out what happens!There are many pros to this book that include strong imagery. ""By seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing up-stairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors, and hair shorn in strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names."" This quote describes the parties that Gatsby throws and can make you feel as if you're there yourself.The cons to this book include that some times things are difficult to understand do to the dialect used in the 1920's. Gatsby. many times, refers to Nick as ""old sport"". That is a term that is no longer used and is obsolete. I would definitely recommend this book! Read it if you're in high school or you're an adult because it is much easier to understand!Enjoy! Warning: May make you want to have your own lavished party!"
2038,Dr. Winner,"As a Doctor of Literature at a prestigious University I can state the The Great Gatsby is an amazing piece of literature portraying the life of the Great (Jay) Gatsby, a Vegas Magician. The Great Gatsby is able to perform magic tricks that no other can...but there is a twist. The Great Gatsby is actually an anthropomorphic burrito from the casino's world famous $6.99 lunch buffet. Jay Gatsby, ""The Great Gatsby"" is able to entertain and amaze all those who witness his incomprehensible magical abilities, but his greatest trick is not getting eaten because he is, after all, a burrito. "
2039,janet,"I just re-read the novella after leaving it alone since high school. I can't believe how much I have to say about it now. At the time, I took away an inaccurate general impression of it being about the jazz age. Really, it represents a Midwestern perspective on the 1920's in the big city and implies a critique of hedonism as a sort of careless birth rite of the wealthy. 'Western' is also used as a category in which Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Kentucky are grouped together. I find this ignores the west coast as completely irrelevant which shows its age and a positioning of the east as pre-eminent. To put a finer point on it, I also consider Kentucky to be Southern, but I could see why he might not deal with this directly.Despite the fact that the narrator seems to disapprove of the parties and avarice, he somehow cares about Gatsby and pulls the reader into this feeling as well despite Gatsby's criminal connections and the fact that his love for Daisy is probably based on her representing money. ‘Her voice is full of money,’ he said suddenly. (128) His refusal to let go of his love for her, which is probably delusional, is interestingly one of the things that ennobles him in the reader's eyes while an ironic distance is maintained at the same time.""He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight—watching over nothing."" (156) Each of the classic lines I quote here is worth a star in a review of Gatsby:""They’re a rotten crowd,’ I shouted across the lawn. ‘You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together.’"" (164)""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made…."" (191)""Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn’t know that the party was over."" (192)I admire the symbolic juxtapositions in the novella, especially because they communicate a certain dark humor. The most obvious, which I remember from high school, are the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg. They are from an advertisement, but are also literally functioning as a source of divine or objective observation. It is crass and yet profound. These conflicting aspects come out when Wilson thinks of those eyes as god while Michaelis is horrified by his misapprehension. ""Standing behind him Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg which hadjust emerged pale and enormous from the dissolving night. ‘God sees everything,’ repeated Wilson.""(170)However, does god really see and punish who is guilty in the story? There seems to be some kind of blind old testament justice in that someone dies because Myrtle did, but then we find Tom sent Wilson to Gatsby knowing he had a gun.There are three other meaningful juxtapositions worth noting. First, there is a wedding going on downstairs as Gatsby's tries for Daisy and loses her. There is also Gatsby compromising principles to get what he wants while his dream doesn't change. This quote expresses it well:""The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption—and he had stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye."" (165)Finally, no one coming to his funeral is an excellent response to the endless parties at his house that ""everyone"" attended. As far as its portrayal of woman, The Great Gatsby incisively shows how Daisy has been created by her society. She functions as an object of contention between men - a prize. I hated her powerlessness and weakness when I read it before in marrying Tom and choosing him again, but now I can see she was trained for it. Extending her irrelevance more cynically, she unwittingly kills her husband's mistress, but isn't told about it or expected to take responsibility.There is a statement that resounds with allusions to American racism and sexism to me today when Daisy refers to ""our white girlhood"" (22), which leads me down a particular avenue of analysis.Racism, anti-semitism, and colonialism play small, yet significant parts in this American story - none of which were discussed in high school. I discuss these not as a way of criticizing the novel, but rather to put it into an American context while showing how postcolonial theory can be extended to American literature. I think this only serves to make literary interpretation richer. While Tom's overt racism is communicated in a critical way, Nick's awareness of race and marked descriptions of people who are not white in the story stand out as diverging greatly from the way main characters aren't generally fully described. African Americans are not acquaintances, but there are random encounters with them driving by and in the man who identifies the car that caused the deadly accident. The description of the people in the car struck me as racist because it suggests separation between Nick and the people he is describing, they are objectified in the description, and the use of the word ""buck"" is akin to a slur. ""As we crossed Blackwell’s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry."" (74) In the statement that health separates men more than anything is the implication that race also is an important factor in defining people which needn't be racist because from a social standpoint this was simply true, but the statement seems to be meant universally, and in that sense can be viewed as racist ideology.It occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well. (p. 132)Anti-semitism is overt in the ugly caricature of Meyer Wolfshiem. How could this have been left out of our discussions in high school? No one else is described in such critical detail. ""Mr. Carraway this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.’ A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half darkness."" His accent, which to me is pure New York, is also caricatured. They are in New York, why doesn't anyone else speak in this way? This is partly that they are Western and also has to do with class. What's more, Wolfshiem represents Gatsby's corruption. Fitzgerald also sexualizes and exocitizes Jewishness in the way he describes Wolfshiem's assistant.""A lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes."" (181)Though there are allusions to the colonial in an early reference to Columbus and a humorously fake account of Gatsby's past that makes him sound like a Raj of India, strikingly clear concepts of colonialism hit the hardest at the end. It is really quite Conradian in its portrayal of North America as an empty green canvas on which to build a nation, fully affirming Manifest Destiny. As I recall in high school, this was interpreted as having religious overtones of America as Edenjc rather than problematized for it being some kind of homage to imperialism.""Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder."" (193)When he uses 'man', this could be including Native Americans, but I don't think so because this vision of it conflicts with what we know about the philosophical approach most of the North Eastern tribes took to the land. Also, the view of it as a continent is a relatively modern geographical term which might not have been part of a localized understanding of place due to less extensive travel. In this case, it is more disturbing that he chooses ""man"" because it implies that his norm for a man is a white colonizer. What is also interesting in this description is the suggestion of appreciating and desiring an unattainable object which is how Daisy is also portrayed for Gatsby. This, along with other references, is where I see feminism and anti-colonialism going together. Finally, I love the questions that are introduced in the novella possibly not meant to be answered. What Nick says about himself which puts him in the role of observer and as completely honest are somewhat suspect:Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known. -65I wonder about the people who don't count at all in the novella. What is the nurse who takes care of Daisy and Tom's child, ""Pammy"" like? The child is a mere convenience to the plot as well.This is also intriguing, but seems a bit much where it was placed. I think it has echoes of Eden and possibly a reaction to what is socially defined as beautiful. ""what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass."" (172)It ends with an inscrutable and ironic last line.  ""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.""This could mean that we are swallowed up by our past like Gatsby or that progress is an illusion. He could also mean death. Whatever the intended meaning, the statement is ironic in its placement in the novella because just previously in his characterization of the continent, he erased or obliterated its human past by accepting a colonial narrative. "
2040,Anna A.,This book is amazing! I definitely recommend it to everyone! The descriptions of the characters and scenes made me want to keep reading. I was very sad to hear at the end that no one came to Gatsby's funeral. I was shocked to read that even Daisy didn't attend the funeral. This book was a joy to read. No wonder this book is a classic!
2041,Erika,"I read this book in high school and I thought it was very tough to read but I absolutely loved it this time and got a lot more out of it. I loved how the story is told from Nick's perspective because he is someone on the outside looking in. He is not part of the drama of the situation which allows the reader to gain an insightful perspective as they read the story. Nick's cousin is Daisy who is married to Tom. Nick's neighbor is Jay Gatsby, the rich man whom owns the mansion of a house next to Nick's who throws elaborate parties throughout the summer in New York (I believe the Hamptons although they say East Egg and West Egg in the book). Gatsby has known Daisy for a long time and they once loved each other and still do. Daisy could not be with Gatsby before because he did not have enough money which is why she married Tom. Tom had a mistress named Myrtle Wilson, whom Nick met. There is also a woman named Jordan Baker who is a famous golfer, who Nick is sort of with. When Tom, daisy, Jordan, and Nick are all together Gatsby tells Tom that daisy and him are in love and she never truly loved Tom. Daisy admits this is true that she loves Gatsby but she did love Tom. The group decides to leave the city and go back to West Egg and on their way back are held up by a car crash. Myrtle was killed by a car (Gatsby's car who Daisy was driving) and Tom and Mr. Wilson, who owns a car garage are very upset. Mr. Wilson thinks that a man killed Myrtle, the same man who hit her, which was actually Tom. Tom hit Myrtle in the face while at the party that Nick was at when he met her. Mr. Wilson seeks revenge on the man and finds out from Tom that Gatsby was the one driving the car. He kills Gatsby in his pool and kills himself close to Gatsby's house. Nick is in charge of arranging the funeral and only 2 people come to Gatsby's funeral which is ironic considering the parties with hundreds of guests that Gatsby had every night. Not even Daisy attends the funeral. "
2042,Mary Grace,"Originally posted at The Solitary Bookworm I had The Great Gatsby sitting in my shelf for quite sometime now and to be honest the only time I had the urge to read the book was when I finished watching the 2013 adaptation with Mr. Di Caprio. You see, this is my second classical read and as I always said – I’ve been always afraid to get into these books for some reason. I’ve been dreading each time picking up any classic but I always end up with that unexpected joy of actually finishing it afterwards. Anyhoo, just finished the book a few moments ago and I have to say. WOW!The Great Gatsby was narrated not by the core character Mr. Gatsby but by Nick Carraway. A curious man who got sucked into the intricate illusion that Gatsby created, Carraway was a unique and effective voice that gave us an intimate and inside look of Mr. Gatsby. Carraway not only adored Gatsby, he also saw what other people did not see – Gatsby was no more than a person delusional in a dream that once was but lost.The pursuit of Gatsby with the love of his life, Daisy Buchanan, was both sweet and tragic. It was madness to a point but with a love like what Gatsby has, I could not see no other way but what has been narrated. The idea indeed made my heart jump but everyone will eventually see the naivety and desperateness of Gatsby in the attempt to pursue his dreams. It was the idea and hope that catches the sympathy of readers but it was as good as any dream. Buchanan was a high reach before James Gatz became the famous Gatsby, and it was a high reach now because Daisy will forever be that girl he once lost. Carraway was correct, the past could not be repeated no matter how hard you push for it.Other characters in the book also played great roles no matter how minor they maybe. One in particular is Tom Buchanan who in the present is Daisy’s husband. A guy who is self absorbed and narcissistic plus I hated his guts. He was very arrogant and self centered – but have to say that he and Daisy complemented each other to the dot for some reason. Daisy was the typical trophy wife but in the Jazz Era – that’s the best description I can think of her. More glitter and spaz, less sense and maturity. She was very shallow at times, very materialistic at most and opportunist. All she could think about was beauty and security – and that’s the only reason she entertained Gatsby – because she thought that he could offer more than what Tom could possible give until she realized it was all a grand facade of what really is.What I love about the book, in addition to the characters, was the how Fitzgerald write the story. It had a sense of mystery, though first and foremost a love story, The Great Gatsby was more than what it appeared like the infamous Mr. Gatsby. It was very intoxicating and I have to admit that I got sucked in like Carraway was. Take note, I did not read this book in a sitting. It was in a span of a week and every time I got back to where I stopped it was like a switch was turned on and I was in West Egg once again sipping champagne in one of Gatsby’s party. The turn of events was very fast yet it did not skip a beat and in spite how sad the ending was, it all makes sense and had the clarity that gave a resolution to its readers.I know I may never give this review justice but for a well known book and a highly adapted film, I have to say that this is definitely an experience worth remembering!NOTE: also did a movie review (2013 adaptation), click link above"
2043,Collins Prime,A finely brewed work of arts by the prolific Fitzgerald himself. Masterfully written.
2044,Jennifer Dominguez,"The Great Gatsby is a marvelous novel about a man who is deeply in love with the wealthy beautiful Daisy Buchanan and would do anything to get her. This novel is amazing and well written. The author F. Scott Fitzgerald writes this novel about a man name Jay Gatsby who is deeply in love with a beautiful women named Daisy Buchanan. Jay Gatsby loses the love of his life when he goes to combat. But she promises Jay that she will be here when he comes back. When Jay comes back Daisy is already married to a wealthy man named Tom Buchanan.There are plenty of characters in this novel but the main characters are NickCaraway the one telling the story. Then there is Daisy and Tom Buchanan and Myrtle and George Wilson. And lets not forget Jordan Baker Daisy's best friend. Last but not least Jay Gatsby. Nick Caraway is a man who works as a bonds salesman who moves to east egg where the middle class live. He is related to Daisy Buchanan. Daisy Buchanan is married to Tom Buchanan whose family is wealthy. They live right across Nick. Across Nick there is West egg where the wealthy live. Myrtle and George Wilson live in the valley of ashes where the poor live. Jordan Baker is a pretty tall wealthy golf player who has a romance with Nick Caraway. And well Jay Gatsby. He is the man who was poor and later became rich and ends up having the girl of his dreams. Well for at least a second.The setting takes place in New York. Whether it's in East egg, West egg or the valley of ashes.East egg is a place where the middle class live. The valley of ashes is the worst. Well that's where the poor live. At the valley of ashes there is a billboard and that billboard has eyes. It sees everything you don't want to be seen. Last is West Egg. West egg is where the rich live. It's filled with beautiful houses and have a great view of the river.Jay Gatsby whose real name is James Gatsby fell in love with Daisy Buchanan. Daisy and Jay met a long time ago before she met Tom. Tom has a mistress whose name is Myrtle and Myrtle is married to a man name George. They live in the valley of ashes. Nick had recently moved in next to Jay Gatsby. Jay Gatsby throws big parties and one day Nick was invited. Jay then tells Nick about his life and how he has so much money. Nick later meets Jordan who is really good friends with Daisy. Jordan then tells Nick about Tom cheating on Daisy. Tom takes Nick to meet his mistress. Then Nick helps Jay Gatsby to reunite with Daisy Buchanan.I honestly can say there is no novel that can remind me of the Great Gatsby. I have special connections to this novel and it has also taught me many things but one thing for sure, love can be the most beautiful thing in life but also very dark. This novel is amazing and breath taking. It's mind twisting, sad and shows how pure evil wealthy people can be just to be happy. This is between old money and new money. Money can over power your way of living and how easy it is to get away from horrifying things. This novel made me feel like a better person and glad to know that I am not as selfish as other human beings can be. The authors style is somewhat eye catching. Some of the pages are in letter format. Other than that, it is a novel that you can slightly close your eyes and picture every moment of it."
2045,Niovi Lyri,"Two or three remarkable things about this famous novel:a)The main place of action brings in mind the archetypical scenery of a greek tragedy or a Shakespearian play: two magnificent houses (Gatsby’s and Buchanan’s), imitating the palaces of two antagonistic kings in a drama, the theater being as well represented by a limited part of earth, a certain i s l a n d. The site encloses the power of a separate, mythic world while it helps Gatsby to shine as a king in every metaphorical meaning of the word. Additionally, it is surrounded by and expanded to the city life (traffic, middle class apartments and dull office blocks) as if this life were originated from and depending on that core, that splendid island kingdom (And not vice versa, which of course is the reality).b) The form described above is given neither to crystallized human pictures from the past nor to some idealized future visions, but to contemporary characters and elements. An author who infuses the air of classic into his own time is really great.c) The book is a masterpiece of the “show, don’t tell” principle. Almost every single paragraph would support it, yet the most remarkable trick is the author’s indirect commenting the basic story (the Gatsby-Daisy affair) by introducing seemingly unrelated episodes with minor characters whose quality, revealed by plain acting, can be used as a comment to the main heroes’ attitude. The most admirable of those ‘secondary” and seemingly “unnecessary” little stories is Jordan’s golf- ball old scandal: why is the author bothered to so explicitly inform us of Jordan’s having been dishonest at a golf tournament? Why is the narrator, Nick, referring to women’s dishonesty in general? And what would be the novel itself without this certain detail, Jordan’s golf ball by which she once cheated a game? Probably it would be the same. Except, D a i s y’s (and not Jordan’s of course) cowardice and dishonesty, which is not at all commented after Gatsby’s sacrifice, is the key not only to the plot finale but to almost everything one would discuss about the book. (Notable also that immediately after Nick’s reflecting on that rumor about Jordan’s cheating, the conversation between the two goes on about her way of d r I v I n g! It seems the author gives us reading directions!). And I did have the final impression that this great novel is primarily neither on “love” nor “the upper class” and its vanity, but on the enigma of human morality.Δυο τρεις παρατηρήσεις, γι αυτό το περίφημο βιβλίο:α) Ο κύριος τόπος δράσης μας φέρνει στο μυαλό το αρχετυπικό σκηνικό ελληνικής τραγωδίας ή σαιξπηρικού έργου: δύο μεγαλόπρεπα σπίτια (Του Γκάτσμπι και του Μπιουκάναν), σαν παλάτια δυο αντίπαλων βασιλέων σ’ ένα δράμα, ενώ σκηνή του θεάτρου γίνεται ένα συγκεκριμένο κομμάτι γης, ένα νησί. Το μέρος έχει τη δύναμη ξεχωριστού μυθικού κόσμου και παράλληλα βοηθάει τον Γκάτσμπι να λάμψει σαν βασιλιάς με κάθε μεταφορική σημασία της λέξης. Επιπλέον περιβάλλεται από τη ζωή της πόλης (κίνηση, διαμερίσματα της μέσης τάξης, βαρετά κτίρια γραφείων) σαν αυτή να προέρχεται και να εξαρτάται από αυτό τον πυρήνα, το λαμπρό μαγικό νησί (Ενώ βεβαίως ισχύει το αντίστροφο).β) Η μορφή αυτή του έργου δεν αφορά αποκρυσταλλωμένες εικόνες του παρελθόντος ούτε οράματα του μέλλοντος, αλλά σύγχρονους χαρακτήρες και στοιχεία. Ο συγγραφέας που δίνει τον αέρα του κλασικού στη δική του εποχή είναι πραγματικά μεγάλος.γ) Το βιβλίο είναι πρότυπο του δόγματος «δείξε, μη λες». Αυτό μπορεί να επαληθευθεί σχεδόν σε κάθε παράγραφο, αλλά το πιο αξιοσημείωτο κόλπο είναι ο πλάγιος σχολιασμός της βασικής ιστορίας (της σχέσης Γκάτσμπι-Νταίζης) από μέρους του συγγραφέα μέσω φαινομενικά άσχετων επεισοδίων με δευτερεύοντες χαρακτήρες των οποίων η ποιότητα, που τη δείχνει μόνο με τη δράση, είναι έμμεσο σχόλιο για τη στάση των βασικών ηρώων. Η πιο θαυμαστή από αυτές τις δευτερεύουσες, φαινομενικά μη απαραίτητες μικρές ιστορίες, είναι το παλιό σκάνδαλο της Τζόρνταν με το μπαλάκι του γκολφ: γιατί άραγε ο συγγραφέας θέλει τόσο καθαρά να μας πληροφορήσει πώς η Τζόρνταν υπήρξε ανέντιμη σε ένα τουρνουά γκολφ; Γιατί ο αφηγητής (και ενεργό πρόσωπο στο μυθιστόρημα) αναφέρεται στην ανεντιμότητα των γυναικών γενικά; Και πώς θα ήταν όλη η νουβέλα χωρίς αυτή τη συγκεκριμένη λεπτομέρεια, το μπαλάκι μέσω του οποίου η Τζόρνταν κάποτε έκλεψε σε ένα παιχνίδι γκολφ; Πιθανότατα ίδια. Μόνο που είναι της Ντ α ί ζ η ς (και όχι της Τζόρνταν βεβαίως) η ανανδρία και ανεντιμότητα (για την οποία δεν γίνεται κανένα σχόλιο μετά τη θυσία του Γκάτσμπι) που είναι κλειδί όχι μόνο για το τέλος της ιστορίας αλλά για οτιδήποτε μπορεί να συζητηθεί γύρω από το βιβλίο. (Αξιοσημείωτο επίσης ότι αμέσως μετά την ανάμνηση από μέρους του Νικ εκείνης της φήμης για την απάτη της Τζόρνταν, η κουβέντα των δυο τους γυρνάει στον τρόπο με τον οποίο η Τζόρνταν οδηγεί αυτοκίνητο! Είναι σαν ο συγγραφέας να μας δίνει οδηγίες ανάγνωσης!). Πράγματι, η τελική μου εντύπωση είναι ότι αυτό το σπουδαίο βιβλίο δεν είναι τόσο ένα μυθιστόρημα για τον «έρωτα» ή για την «ανώτερη τάξη» και την κενότητά της, όσο ένα έργο γύρω από το αίνιγμα της ανθρώπινης ηθικής."
2046,Derby Reeves,"This book was an excellent window into the Jazz Age and the Roaring Twenties. The biggest takeaway was how irresponsibly and recklessly the rich adults lived in this era. Usually we read novels steeped in poverty and misery to see how those other than us live. However, this time we take to the opposite end of the spectrum and learn about how the more fortunate half live. I found a distressing amount of irresponsibility among the adults. The symbolism cannot be ignored, least of all the concluding line that seems to tie a nice bow around the attitude of the melancholy and dolorous Daisy and Tom. Similarly, that iconic ""green light"" had an incredibly broad range of interpretation, but I take the light to be a glimmer of the past that Gatsby hopes he can reconnect with once again, only to find it to distant and too far removed. "
2047,Ale RLZ,"It was that perfect example of an impossible love story. I must say that i spoiled myself and watched the movie before i read the book so i knew its sad end but it was still full of emotions and sadness.The story itself is gorgeous and pretty complicated . I found myself loving this Gatsby for his character and for the way he would give everything up just to have Daisy and i can't forget about Nick who was probably the sweetest friend someone could ever have and i feel really sorry for him . In my opinion, this book deserves to be read and enjoyed till the end of time.(i'm sorry if i've made some mistakes but my first language isn't english so...)"
2048,Kemper,"Jay Gatsby, you poor doomed bastard. You were ahead of your time. If you would have pulled your scam after the invention of reality TV, you would have been a huge star on a show like The Bachelor and a dozen shameless Daisy-types would have thrown themselves at you. Mass media and modern fame would have embraced the way you tried to push your way into a social circle you didn’t belong to in an effort to fulfill a fool’s dream as your entire existence became a lie and you desperately sought to rewrite history to an ending you wanted. You had a talent for it, Jay, but a modern PR expert would have made you bigger than Kate Gosselin. Your knack for self-promotion and over the top displays of wealth to try and buy respectability would have fit right in these days. I can just about see you on a red carpet with Paris Hilton. And the ending would have been different. No aftermath for rich folks these days. Lawyers and pay-off money would have quietly settled the matter. No harm, no foul. But then you’d have realized how worthless Daisy really was at some point. I’m sure you couldn’t have dealt with that. So maybe it is better that your story happened in the Jazz Age where you could keep your illusions intact to the bitter end.The greatest American novel? I don’t know if there is such an animal. But I think you'd have to include this one in the conversation."
2049,Chad Stoner,The great Gatsby was very engaging to the reader and it had great character description. I recommend this book to everyone who enjoys realistic fiction and a bit of drama and suspense as well.
2050,Roland Martinez,I hated this book in high school and couldn't get why the shallow characters were interesting. I loved it this time around.
2051,Tonya Wertman,"Gatsby is a hero in my book! He dared to believe that he could recapture the first rush of young love--something we all long for...to keep the magic of first experience. None of the other charcters in this book are very likeable. They are spoiled, selfish, ruthless and unconcerned with the consequences of their actions. I'm sure Fitzgerald is drawing on his own life and people he knew and the lives they all had to wite this. It is hard not to place Zelda (his wife) in the role of Daisy and this makes the characters come to life in a huge way. It is so easy to become swept up in this story, to be on Long Island that summer in 1922, to be at the parties at Gatsby's house and enamoured with the wealth and glamor. Do not pass it up!"
2052,Alessandro,"Rimarranno in me le descrizioni dense, le emozioni forti, e quel cattivo sapore dei soldi."
2053,marta,"I love Fitzgerald's prose, because it sounds like pure poetry. "
2054,Ensiform,"This was ""the authorized text,” with notes, preface and brief biography of the author by Matthew J. Bruccoli. Nick Carraway narrates the story of James Gatz, a penniless young man of few prospects, who reinvents himself as wealthy James Gatsby in order to capture the heart of Daisy, the woman he loves. Unfortunately, she is married to Tom, Nick’s cousin; and Nick has his own relationship problems with Jordan, Daisy’s friend.It’s far more than a soap opera of the smart set, however, as the bare-bones plot synopsis might make it sound. It’s an intricately plotted, meticulously written, introspective work on seeking the past and to what extent people can reinvent themselves. It is also an ironic comment on the seedier side of the American dream, the substitution of flashy tawdriness for true greatness, the warping of opportunity into opportunism. The prose is superb; Fitzgerald has fine-tuned the cadences of American English and written a symphony of words. Gatsby is an immediately intriguing character, the sympathetic bootlegger and adulterer who seems to want, aside from Daisy, nothing more than to be understood, at least by Nick. "
2055,Rolls,"""The Great Gatsby"" is considered by many to be the zenith of American fiction writing in the last century. I won't say that it is the best American novel I've read but I will say it is probably the most perfect.Along with J.D. Salinger, Fitzgerald has got to be my favorite writer of fiction. As opposed to Hemingway's bluntness, and Faulkner's artiness, Fitzgerald's prose seems(to paraphrase Michael Chabon) to rain down from style heaven. His style in fact is like the ladies he writes about: cool, lean and absolutely enchanting. He would never dream of overwriting and knows exactly when to hold back for maximum effect. His use of the language is assured and consequently eminently readable. For that alone this should be considered the Mona Lisa of prose.What is astounding though is how he puts his sparsely elegant style to use giving his characters shade and depth. Fitzgerald is a true student of humanity and his skills of observation are razor sharp. He sums up his characters in sentences that read like aphorisms bulging with truth about the human condition. There's not a page goes by I'm not gasping at the depth of his vision and the economy he uses to express it.So far I've dwelt on how he wrote and not on what he wrote. People who'd back another nag in the Great American Novel derby knock Fitzgerald's sophomoric (their word not mine) obsession with romance between men and women. They reduce his works to the level of melodramatic tear jerkers. This is a gross simplification of his talents. Yes ""Gatsby"" focuses on a doomed love affair but it does so to illustrate the errors in thinking that he felt marred his generation. Gatsby is about the hollowness of the American dream as dreamt in the twenties. Fitzgerald looked around him (and in the mirror)and saw men and women locked in a frenzied and ultimatley doomed race for speed, money and sin. Gatsby and Daisy's love is doomed because their values have been distorted by money and comfort and opulence. They cannot see the depths because they are too easily distracted by shiny surfaces. When Daisy cries as Gatsby shows off his elegantly tailored shirts because she has never seen clothes so beautiful sums up perfectly how for her exteriors matter most. This is at the heart of the tragedy that unfolds before us in this delicious little novel.There is no denying this is one of the GREAT BOOKS. If you haven't read it do so. I dare you to not fall in love with it."
2056,David Lentz,"The Great Gatsby is a classic novel of the Jazz Age about aspiration in America. As V.S. Naipaul was recently quoted in the NY Times Book Review: ""The only valuable life is one that is shaped by the anguish of aspiration and that is engaged in a struggle against the void of nonachievement."" Gatsby's life personifies the aspiration of a young man who has just returned from World War I so poor that he wore his uniform after his discharge because he couldn't afford to buy new clothes. Through his own entrepreneurial talents he rises to attain an immense fortune, which he hopes will renew the affection of his much beloved object of desire, Daisy Buchanan. She once jilted him because of his abject poverty and married another wealthy man. Now that Gatsby is rich, he wants Daisy to become his wife at any price. He asks her to forsake her relationship to her wealthy, philandering husband. The denouement of the novel is opulent in its irony. Gatsby's demise and the response of his many friends to it is truly memorable. Fitzgerald as Nick Carraway is an intelligent, articulate, noble and faithful narrator in this great American novel. At a time when so much focus has been placed on the hubris of American CEOs, the message of this novel about the unbridled pursuit of material wealth plays with as much high fidelity now as it did in the Jazz Age. This brief but important and beautifully crafted novel is a must-read for anyone who seeks to know the best work of one of America's most legendary writers. "
2057,Muriomu,"Fitzgerald con questo lavoro ci mostra senza abbellimenti quella che è la vita dell'alta società nell'America degli anni 20', quelli passati alla storia come i cosidetti ""anni d'oro"".La scrittura è coinvolgente, le descrizioni sono dettagliate, delicate e poetiche.Fitzgerald è bravissimo a far percepire le sensazioni che descrive, non si limita a raccontarci i luoghi e le persone, ci racconta le emozioni.Attraverso la voce di Nick Carraway scopriamo i desideri, i peccati, le bugie e le piacevoli concessioni a cui la gente che gli sta attorno è avvezza. Un mondo libertino, fatto di soldi, feste, champagne, tradimenti e segreti.Un mondo che Nick Carraway, appena trasferitosi a Long Island dal West, disprezza, ma in cui volente o nolente si ritrova coinvolto.Sua cugina Daisy vive nell'Est Egg dall'altra parte dell'isola, assieme a suo marito Tom e alla loro figlioletta Pammy.Dal primo incontro con loro capiamo che questo è tutto tranne che un matrimonio d'amore.Lui la tradisce, e l'ha tradita con chissà quante donne, nei pochi anni della loro unione, e lei, attraverso malinconici sguardi e velate proteste, mal sopporta tutto, ma comunque resiste.Dopotutto il suo è quello che si può definire un ""buon"" matrimonio, e dove mancano la fiducia ed il rispetto, possono sopperire comodità, denaro e lusso.Ogni personaggio nei tre mesi estivi in cui la storia è narrata, mette Nick a conoscenza dei propri segreti.Tom contribuisce a questo intreccio di rivelazioni presentandogli amante e il rispettivo coniuge, naturalmente ignaro della tresca.Segreti e rivelazioni a cui Nick prova disagio ad essere messo al corrente, e dalle quali gradirebbe tenersene fuori.Unica figura che suscita in lui uno strano e inaspettato senso di curiosità è quella del suo vicino di casa: il signor Gatsby.Lo scorge una sera per caso, solo in giardino, mentre malinconico tende le mani verso la vastità del mare a lui di fronte.Da questo particolare capiamo che dietro alle numerose feste, all'apparenza della sua magnificenza c'è in realtà qualcosa di più che un magnate in cerca di fama e di successo.C'è una speranza, c'è un sogno.Ed è questo che rande così coinvolgente questo personaggio scritto dalla penna di Fitzgerald.Lui ci racconta di un uomo potente, che ha raggiunto la sua posizione grazie al perseguimento di obbiettivo, e quell'obbiettivo altro non è che l'amore.Un protagonista magnetico e accattivante, pieno di fiducia in se stesso, negli altri e nel destino, è questo l'uomo che Fitzgerald ci ha voluto raccontare.Un buono, un puro, romantico e anche un po' infantile, perché come i bambini non vede complicazioni nei suoi sogni, per lui tutto è realizzabile, possibile.Così, quando ritrova Daisy, dopo averla aspettata per anni, per lui è tutto ovvio e semplice: tornare insieme, ricominciare da dove si erano lasciati cinque anni prima, come se nulla fosse cambiato, come se non ci fosse un matrimonio di mezzo.Lui non vuole un'amante, vuole avere Daisy tutta per sé, sua, perché è così che lui l'ha sempre sentita.L'amore vero, unico eterno, incorruttibile questo è quello che Gatsby prova e non riesce a concepirne uno diverso.E lui ha davvero fatto tutto il possibile per raggiungerlo, tutto quello che gli era concesso per riafferrare quel sogno.E mentre tutti i suoi ospiti, i mille volti che la sua enorme villa ospitava nelle sere estive, erano intenti ad interrogarsi sul suo passato, affibbiandogli i peggiori crimini e le più losche accuse, tirando ad indovinare il grado della sua corruzione, lui era lì estraneo a tutto. Estraneo a quel mondo marcio che tutto distorce e contamina, lui era lì, con gli occhi rivolti al mare, le braccia tese verso una luce verde, a coltivare il suo sogno incorruttibile.“E mentre ero seduto là a meditare sul vecchio, sconosciuto mondo, pensai alla meraviglia di Gatsby quando per la prima volta aveva scorto la luce verde all'estremità del pontile di Daisy. Aveva percorso una lunga strada fino a quel prato blu e il suo sogno gli doveva essere sembrato così vicino che difficilmente avrebbe potuto fallire nell'afferrarlo”Per leggere la mia recensione completa vai qui:http://cafelitterairedamuriomu.blogsp..."
2058,Timothy,"I'm glad I never had to read this during my younger years in high school. If I had I'd have thought of this work as mediocre at best and probably never read it again. In my opinion the storyline of this title is fairly good but the literary delivery is superb, hence the high rating. I enjoyed being taken into the post-WWI Roaring Twenties era and I'd have no problem reading this title again in the future. For me, the following two lessons can be deduced after reading the book: #1: Life isn't fair (duh), and...#2: It doesn't matter whatever ambitions and/or obsessions are used to make your lot in life, the only thing acquired at the end is a dash between two dates in a rock with your name on it. Happy Reading."
2059,Arif Hafejee,"This is a story about a man named Nick who is living in America in the 1920s. He moves to New York to become a bond trader and finds that he lives next to a large mansion occupied by a mysterious man named Gatsby. Gatsby hosts wild parties every night with lots of women and alcohol. And when Nick is invited, he learns that Gatsby had also been in the army. However, no one really knows how Gatsby got rich. Nick reunites with his cousin, Daisy, a flirtatious young woman who is married to Tom, a rich businessman. However, Tom is having an affair with a mechanic’s wife, Myrtle. Nick meets Daisy’s friend, Jordan, a young professional golfer, and they form a romantic relationship. Meanwhile, Nick and Gatsby become friends and Gatsby shares how he inherited his wealth from a yacht owner. It is also revealed that Gatsby had known Daisy when they were younger and he is still in love with her. In fact, Gatsby secretly watches Daisy from across the lake, as Daisy lives there with Tom and her daughter. Gatsby and Daisy finally meet and a flood of emotions come back. They profess their love for one another. The weather gets hot and to escape the heat, they all drive in to town. Tom finds out that Daisy wants to leave him and gets upset, telling Daisy and Gatsby to drive back home where they will further discuss it. However, Daisy, driving Gatsby’s yellow car, runs over Myrtle by accident. Tom then tells the mechanic that it was Gatsby who run over Myrtle. And as Gatsby is swimming at home, the mechanic shows up and shoots him. Sadly, no one shows up to Gatsby’s funeral and Nick, confused and saddened, sells everything and moves back to the Midwest. First of all, the story presents a historical snapshot of the 1920s, an interesting time in American history. We get the vivedness of the time, with the lights and glamour that saturated the people. Drinking, parties, and sex were to be celebrated, not condemned. And it should be noted that to express this energy and culture through writing is a difficult task. It’s simply not just saying that there were bright lights and cocktails, but emerging a reader in this world with subtle reminders of the culture. Identity is also an important theme, as characters, as with real people, have complex identites that often involve deceit. People are not who they say they are: Tom and Myrtle having an affair and the ambiguous history of Gatsby, as Gatsby’s name isn’t even his real name. In fact, as readers, we are reminded of this when his father shows up and corrects Nick, saying that his name wa ‘James Gatz’. There are several explanations given to us as to how Gatsby became wealthy. Readers learn early on how he gained his wealth, but are still left wondering how that wealth had been maintained over years. Ambiguous phone calls seem to be coming to the house, even after Gatsby’s death, which hints at illegal gambling as a source of income for Gatsby. Nick makes an interesting observation about parties that could still be true today. That while they happen every weekend, there is a certain emptiness experienced at parties. This emptiness derives from how fake and replaceable people are. That if you attend enough parties, they all tend to be the same. Furthermore, Gatsby wishes he could go back to when he had first met Daisy. And any character that wishes the present were the past, that things were the way they used to be, is doomed. This is a strong literary device and several of the best stories incorporate this in their tragic characters. So be forewarned, living in the past is dangerous. "
2060,Marifer Aldrete,"Ahora se por que es un clásico americano y por que se han echo dos adaptaciones cinematográficas de este libro. Desde que lo empece a leer me atrapo y la verdad pocas veces pensé que la historia era tediosa, desde el primer párrafo quieres saber quien es este hombre del que todos hablan. Tengo que admitir que llegue a pensar que el Gatsby era en realidad una especie de ilusión (ni idea por que) pero cuando hace su aparición, viejo, quería saber todo lo que hacia.Como mensaje puedo decir que la sociedad que se presenta en este libro no es muy diferente a la de hoy. Seguimos siendo los mismos seres humanos interesados y deslindados a problemas que son ajenos a los nuestros. Nick en verdad es un buen personaje y la realidad que le llega después del funeral, es la cruda verdad que todos tenemos que estar conscientes. Puedes estar rodeada de centenares de personas y sentirte tan sola, cuando mas necesitas de los que te rodean te dan la espalda, en vida o en muerte. Tener en claro tus sueños es sano en la medida que conoces la realidad de ellos y no inviertes tanto tiempo en la felicidad que te harán sentir cuando lo obtengas. James vivio en su obsesión por Dassy y sabemos como acabo todo. La luz verde era el resultado de la suma de todo lo que esperaba obtener algún día, a lo que trataba de alcanzar con uñas y dientes, esa insipiracion que hace que todos nosotros nos tratemos de aferrar desesperadamente aun cuando estamos cayendo al vació, esa esperanza que nos alegra y nos destruye. PD: Amarillo y verde."
2061,Dani,"The last time I held this book in my hands was in 11th grade. I was supposed to do a book review for the newspaper project we were working on in my history class. Like any other stressed out/over-worked/over-achieving teenager, I had put too much on my plate at the time so I ended up reading the first chapter of the book then skimming the rest to make a decent review. So now that it's been over a decade since then, and with the excitement of the new movie coming out next summer, I decided to pick the book up and actually enjoy reading it this time. And I have to say I was not disappointed. The Great Gatsby is a story about the dark side of the American Dream. A man gets what he wants but ends up losing more than he had. A woman experiences young love, loses it, moves on and then has the chance to rekindle an old flame. The lifestyles of the well-off and the slightly bored upper-class of 1920s New York is explored, showing both the glamor and the scars. And all of this told by an outside viewer, showing that even he doesn't quite have the words to explain the decadence and lavish lifestyles of those who feel they have no responsibilities for many of their actions. A fast read, The Great Gatsby is the perfect book to take with you to the beach, to enjoy on a sunny day in your favorite reading chair by the window or in your best relaxing chair on the porch. At times I felt like I was transported to this time period, one of my favorites, and got to experience a small piece of the dark side 1920s high society. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a quick escape from their normal life. "
2062,Ivan Rott,"I failed to appreciate the monumental importance of Fitzgerald's opus when I read The Great Gatsby in high school; nearly a decade later, I see it now."
2063,Līga Vītola,"The perfect recipe of loving both, the book and its adaption for the screen is: read the book 30-50%, watch the film, finish the book. Tested it twice, works like a charm! The problem is, though, that it's close to impossible to separate them afterwards and write a review about the novel only. So I'm not going to do that. My thoughts on both:These days hardly any love story is about love. The popular definition of love today is forged by Tailor Swift’s love songs, Stephenie Meyer’s love triangles, TV shows like  The Bachelor  or, even worse,  How I Met Your Mother.  As a result, it is no wonder we do not know how to talk about  love  anymore. But it seems that Fitzgerald knew. He knew how to make his characters fall deeply in love with one another, with wealth, or glamour, up to the point of destruction. You see how it all turned out. Gatsby was in love with Daisy, as far as his ambitious and insecure personality would let him - deeply, madly, truly? He saw her as his little precious adorable thing, to be preserved in a diamond castle, cherished and admired. Because that is exactly what she was, and she was clear on that point - a fool, ‘a beautiful little fool’. Did she care whose little fool she was? What she really loved, was her life. Tom, too, loved his lifestyle, his social status, wealth, and the fact that he could do just about anything and get away with it. I believe that he probably loved Daisy too, in a Tom’s kind of way, as well as Myrtle, but we cannot forgive him. Then who was the antagonist? Was it Tom, who believed that, at the end, ‘what he had done was, to him, entirely justified’? Or our little beautiful fool Daisy, with her voice ‘full of money’, destruction and carelessness? Or was it Wilson, because he had the gun and the resolution? Let me see… I convict you, Daisy Buchanan, of the incapability of making any sound judgments and taking full responsibility for your actions and words. Tom Buchanan, you are found guilty of adultery, provision of false information, and of being a dick. George Wilson, you are convicted of two murders, including a successful suicide attempt, and you are sentenced to life-time in prison, which won’t be necessary in your circumstances, of course. Oh, and Daisy, a murder as well. By accident. Whatever. Let’s see, Myrtle gets one for adultery and alcohol abuse. Wait, you all get one for alcohol abuse, probably drunk driving, and speeding and, Daisy, I forgot adultery, so add that too. This is too difficult, I can’t follow! Moving on.Nick Carraway. Who was this guy anyway? Let me tell you (and this is my review, so I will avoid any modality, because I am sure of this) - he was a device. Not as much a plot device as a narrative device. He was our story teller, the only one about whom we knew all the facts, all the thoughts, the motives - and, essentially - the only one about whom we didn’t care much. (He didn’t himself - Fitzgerald made the guy forgot his birthday to prove the point!) He was the observer. He didn’t belong to this world of glamour, excess and fortune, and so don’t we, therefore he is the perfect window into the Roaring Twenties. The only other character of similar significance was Jordan, because she was an observer too, but Jordan was  one of them . Nick had the seat in the first row when Tom met his mistress, when Gatsby tried to meet Daisy, when Daisy met Gatsby, when Daisy and Gatsby met Tom, when Tom met Wilson and when nobody wanted to meet Gatsby anymore… In some of these occasions I wanted to ask - why - why was he even invited? But it wasn’t hard to convince myself that his presence was actually needed for them, to simply lessen their guilt. If we take Carraway out of the story, it loses its veil of… oh, come on, I can’t come up with anything, it simply loses its five stars!And the Great Gatsby. This is where I have to accredit DiCaprio, because it felt like his impersonation of Gatsby brought the character to a whole new level, even further than the book ever could for me. Leo’s Gatsby was truly great, while the one I met in the novel seemed rather just above average in terms of this  greatness. Here I speak for myself only, though. For the overall mood I would have to thank Baz Luhrmann, because my imagination could not compete with the film, and the music, oh, the music was perfect!To wrap up, (which I should - about now - definitely) five stars. Yes."
2064,Jeffrey West,Well that was a quick and fantastic book.

Check out the new trailer for the forthcoming release of the Movie in 2013 @ http://more2read.com/review/the-great-gatsby-by-f-scott-fitzgerald/Gatsby, Jay a millionaire who just throws his money around a tycoon of sorts bites off more than he can chew. Fitzgerald is trying to show us maybe how shallow these rich characters are how they play against each other and how their friendships are paper thin badgered by suspicions, envy and jealousy. Gatsby leads a lavish and hedonistic lifestyle. The protagonist strikes some similarities to what i have heard of Fitzgerald's lifestyle. The author writes with a nice writing prose. Adapted to screen four times and another movie on the way with Di'caprio, what's the attraction with this story? Do we envy their lives, do we maybe look at them and say well I would do things different do it better and have a different partner, spend that money in other ways? Well thats the beauty of stories sometimes we get some food for thought.Last few sentences of the novel..""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning---- So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.""

Lets hope DiCaprio does a good job playing Jay Gatsby.http://more2read.com/?review=the-great-gatsby-by-f-scott-fitzgerald"
2066,Ryan Chapman,"Thought it might be time to revisit one of my favorites from high school. Verdict on the first 50pgs: Fitzgerald's prose is far better than I remembered it being. I mean, wow.Also: he died at 44yrs old? I knew it was young, but that's like Keats or Hart Crane."
2067,Fatma,Beautifully written and incredibly thought provoking. Fitzgerald's prose is truly unparalleled.
2068,Dane," There is a reason that The Great Gatsby is considered one of the greatest pieces of American literature . The novel is very well written and dives into many aspects of life in the 20's. Fitzgerald presents themes of disillusionment and money in a way that makes the reader reflective of their own experiences and desires. The novel also carries a theme about what we desire and dream about, and what might be wrong with having those desires. After reading the novel you feel incomplete and disillusioned, exactly how Fitzgerald wanted us to feel. Overall the novel is an incredible experience that should make any reader reflective about their hopes and dreams."
2069,Annaleta,"I LOVE this book, and I'm not entirely sure why. The writing is absolutely brilliant; Fitzgerald seems to pump out beautiful and symbolic sentences like ""what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men."" effortlessly. The book itself is double sided. One side is purely the narrative. In it Nick meet's some wealthy and rather awful people, including Gatsby, and is thrown into their turbulent affairs and mistakes. The narrative could probably be condensed into the simple ""He likes her but she likes him"" story line. However the book carries so much more then that. Fitzgerald uses his masterful language to make that simple story become a stark commentary on the ""Gilded Age"" of the 1920's, and on the human race's susceptibility of becoming conquered by our affections, and that's probably why I love it so much. It carries so much drama and depth in so little, and does it so well, that it should automatically be one everyone's must read lists. "
2070,John Igo,"This is an amazing book. Fitzgerald writes a compelling story about the lives of 5 assholes. I don't think you're supposed to see a story like this as fairly accurate retelling of your life, but I did. Unfortunately I was Gatsby - she was Daisy. Maybe I'll finish this review later. This book is a memorable quote mill, here are some of them“Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.” “In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.""Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,"" he told me, ""just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.” “I couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.” “I hope she'll be a fool -- that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.” “And I like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”“You see I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad things that happened to me.” “There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.” ""No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.” “It’s a great advantage not to drink among hard drinking people.” “It takes two to make an accident.” “There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind…” ""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter—to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning——So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.” "
2071,David Duica,"Uno de los mejores libros que he leído este año y me atrevería a decir que de toda mi vida.Fitzgerald nos presenta a uno de los personajes más perdedores y al mismo tiempo más triunfadores y soñadores que ha dado la literatura. Es imposible hablar de su magistral enfoque narrativo, de los perfectos diálogos y de la manera hermosa en que esta escrito."
2072,Harsh Kumar,"Truly amazing. One of the greatest literary novels of all time. This novel is short and sweet. It is mesmerising , the author wrote this novel in a lucid manner. A few things are not in detail , the writer has left a few things to the reader's imagination. One can understand a bit of human nature from this book. It probably consists of all human sentiments and traits, love , hatred , sorrow, tranquillity, guilt , betrayal , accomplishments , sacrifice , strength , dreams etc etc. Pretty hard to describe a book as such. A reader who is well acquainted with the hardships of love and life will truly understand this novels value. A tragic love story with a sad ending. I would recommend this book to all the readers interested in love and it's aspects. Truly how exquisite love can be and at the same time how cruel it can be. Classic and excellent. "
2073,Henry Avila,"Jay Gatsby is a mysterious man, who gives extravagant parties on Long Island, New York, outside his palatial mansion , in the warm summer nights. That he doesn't know the people he invites, not to mention the numerous gatecrashers, might make it a little strange! But this being the roaring 20's, anything goes, rumors abound about Gatsby, bootlegger ? Who cares, as long as the free liquor , great food and the beautiful music continues. Finally attending one of his own gatherings, and we discover that he's after Daisy, a lost love, she's married, which complicates the delicate situation. Nick, Daisy's cousin arrives in town and through him, reunites Gatsby with his former girlfriend. She enjoys luxury, which is why Daisy married rich Tom and not poor Jay. A car accident kills Tom's girlfriend, yes he's a creep but a wealthy one, it's vague who's responsible, but her husband thinks he knows. Death in a swimming pool, ends this tragedy and symbolizes the Jazz Age ... Thoughts: Gatsby was a tortured, lonely man, even shy, who tried to become a member of the establishment. He, with all his riches, needed to enter it, to become part of it, to feel alive but could never remove the dirt and his lowly, and embarrassing origins. They (the upper class), used him and laughed at the stranger behind his back. And the illusions about Daisy , a woman who never really existed, except in his distorted mind. The truth shocked Gatsby, the pretend gentleman but he could never let go of the mirage. If he did, there would be nothing left of his soul."
2074,Pietro,"
I ruggenti anni Venti
Se c'è un modo per assaporare e conoscere quelli che vengono chiamati i ruggenti anni Venti, questo è sicuramente leggere Il grande Gatsby. La storia di un uomo ricco ed enigmatico il cui unico scopo nella vita è riconquistare l'amore perduto. I personaggi di questo splendido romanzo si aggirano tra lussuosi androni gremiti di donne e uomini elegantemente vestiti, di sale da ballo dove la musica jazz scatena primitivi istinti, dove il fumo di sigari e sigarette stagna sul soffitto. Un vortice di feste etiliche, donne disponibili, contrabbandieri e enormi ricchezze; un vortice che, ci appare chiaro da subito, non può che trascinare i suoi protagonisti verso un epilogo drammatico. E' in questa confusione, un misto tra vita sregolata e romanticismo, che Fitzgerald ha vissuto i suoi anni migliori, quelli del successo e del vizio e che lo hanno poi portato alla rovina. Il pregio de Il grande Gatsby non è solo quello di rappresentare un decennio di agio e divertimento, ma anche quello di conferire alla sua prosa un sapore decadente, come se la festa fosse già finita da un pezzo o addirittura non fosse mai iniziata. Così continuiamo a remare, barche contro corrente, risospinti senza posa nel passato."
2075,Gea,This may be the most beautiful writing I have ever encountered. It is a perfect gem of a story. (view spoiler)[Tragic and romantic. (hide spoiler)]
2076,Gee,"I had to read this for school, and I honestly enjoyed it so much, I loved the writing style and the characters and what they all represent. I did not expect to like this but I was pleasantly surprised! also the film is amazing, the second time I watched it I fell in love with it."
2077,Sandra,Goddamn. Now I'm sad. And angry...
2078,Emma Howroyd,"This book is the first classic I have read and actually been able to finish it. I absolutely loved this book. I didn't expect that ending however and was surprised that's how it ended. That really added to the story I thought. I loved the characters, even though they all had their flaws. I enjoyed the setting as well, the historical aspect was well done and the mentions of the first world war. I would recommend this as a get way into classics. Definitely going to read more of Fitzgerald's works."
2079,Michella Prasilo,"At the first two or three chapters I was so lost and I had absolutely no idea what I was reading, until Nick and Gatsby encountered. So I did a realy quick re-read. Then everything became more and more interesting.Nick Carraway is my favourite. I want to have a friend like him. Oh how I like him so much! And Gatsby... well he is complicated. His life is like a deep well and its water is the mixture of power, obsession, and desperation. The story about his life is worth reading.And in the end I was breathing heavily and I finished this book with my mouth open. The last sentence! I love the last sentence so much! This story is so heartbreaking."
2080,Antica,"This book has been on my TBR pile for quite some time, seeing that it was a classic I was bound to read at one point of time. With the movie coming out, I decided to push it up the pile and start reading it.The best thing about this book is the writing, this book has been written so sophistically and classy you can’t help but admire it. The mystery behind Jay Gatsby was the second more intriguing thing about this book and how this character came to be what he is. This book hits you with a wave of reality, showing that even though you’ve worked hard to obtain many things, you may not always get the thing that you want the most.5/5 stars "
2081,Tina Hayes,"Set in the Roarin' Twenties, this unforgetable classic is a romance as well as the story of Jay Gatsby. F. Scott Fitzgerald told the story in a unique way, through the voice of Nick Carraway, an impartial aquaintace of both Gatsby and Daisy. Details of the golden era come alive in vivid descriptions of fashion, music, and decor, carrying the reader back to a time of bootleg liquor and the newly invented automobile. Jay Gatsby lives in a luxurious mansion. He sometimes stands on the beach in his backyard gazing across the water at a green light marking the home Daisy Buchanan, the love of his life who is, unfortuately, married to someone else. Daisy's two-timing husband Tom is not impressed with Mr. Gatsby. As the tale unfolds, we see that Jay Gatsby is quite a different man than the most people think. Beautifully written, I highly recommend this classic romance."
2082,Leo Olmos,"""Hating ""The Great Gatsby"" is like spitting into the Grand Canyon. It will not be going away anytime soon, but you will be. Classics always have many things wrong with them, especially by contemporary standards. To enumerate defects is to miss the point. Like complaining that a painting isn't clear & vivid to the eye because your own shadow has fallen over it."" - Joyce Carol OatesA melancholic, raw portrayal of the downfall of society and the disappointment that comes from looking for the American Dream. Fitzgerald plays with his readers with pure delight; yes, the grand scope of Gatsby is in its jazzy atmosphere, wild parties, affairs, etc. But that it's only the surface. I believe it requires many readings, many analyses, both discussed and written. It requires attention. It's not the light reading you might think it is. Also, it's not a love story, as much as the movie adaptations want it to be. Yes, there's a love aspect, but it's mostly used as a metaphor for lost dreams and the stubbornness of getting what you can't have. At the end, you feel suffocated by the real meaning of the book. The ending is harsh and cold. Relentless. Enervating.A literary masterpiece. Period."
2083,Ronielle,"I will miss teaching this book next year - one of the best books ever. Every time I read this book, I am impressed by Fitzgerald's brilliance. Every sentence in the book was crafted carefully and beautifully. So much in this book - it is worth a read if it has been a while."
2084,Lynda,"It was 45 years ago that I read this book, and I had forgotten how good it was. This time I truly understood Nick's role as narrator. There is no way we could have understood the complexities of it without his voice. "
2085,Trevor,"I first read this over ten years ago. I was too young to appreciate it--I don't think I caught any of the indictment on the U.S.--but when reading it again I was surprised at how many images had stuck in my mind. What a powerful book! To those who haven't read it, it is a quick read, surprisingly accessible considering the depth of the subject matter and the short number of pages. Not only is the story fascinating, but Fitzgerald does an amazing job at evoking not only an atmosphere but also an era. This is a meaningful work that is strangely simple.I also put the last chapter as one of the greatest ending in literature--one of those powerful endings like Joyce's The Dead, Garcia Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude, or Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms."
2086,Bethany," “Flushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier or civilization.”The character development was the most powerful factor for me throughout this book. Fitzgerald’s intelligent and sensitive treatment of the people draws the reader in, makes the lengthy plot development enjoyable, and opens a profound discussion of class distinction in the USA. Ultimately, Gatsby’s unending dream propels him into the story, but it’s the uncrossable gulf between him and Tom that makes it all happen. Tom’s security in his station is what feeds his ignorance about others, and his ignorance is what allows him to produce all of the trouble that comes to everyone. In the beginning of the story, it seems as if this is a failing unique to Tom, but in time the reader comes to see that all the wealthy inhabitants of West Egg are equally flawed. The best of them buckle when anything resembling a need arises, especially in the context of a low-rent scandal. Gatsby’s “greatness,” at first seems to be all about his terrific parties. This evolves with the plot though, and the reader comes to see that though Gatsby seems so “great” in the beginning because of his magnetic personality, and later appears to be so because of his rise to wealth and comfort, he finally arrives as the dreamer- the poor boy who struck it rich, the relentless lover who could never give up… This makes Gatsby so great. He is, in fact, what so many average folks in this country are too. “Boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly to the past.” Mr. Carraway cites the Midwest, but really we are all just so many hopefuls with goals, in various levels of attainableness, often ignorant of or ignoring the fact that they are gone from us already. The higher our level of physical comfort, the more we tend to take it for granted, and the more insulated we are from recognizing the struggles of those with less. I could be wrong, but I tend to think of this as a rather American weakness. By the time an individual has reached Tom’s level of wealth, the trifling issues of anyone beneath him, the morals, the needs- are all simply subject to the way they serve him. "
2087,Sydney Miller,"I am going to marry this book. I am going to promise to love it and keep it for the rest of my life. The story was just so much that my heart wanted to explode. I haven't been attached to a book like this in years. My words are just hopeless in this review because I really cannot place what was so right, just all of it. Gatsby and Daisy and Tom and everyone are just so complicated. I'm not sure who was in the right and who was in the wrong and what was the right decision to make, but I got to watch their lives play out. It was so fascinating and it just seemed so real. I will read this book a million more times. There is reason it is a classic!"
2088,Kelly Chiem,"I read this novel upon a class assignment, and it is one of the best novels I've ever read. F. Scott Fitzgerald is purely ingenious. Every detail is vivid, every scene in this novel has its importance,and he portrayed the reality of attaining the American Dream so well in this fictional story. If you liked the movie, I guarantee you the book is that much more astounding. You miss more of a clear perception of symbolism in the movie than what Fitzgerald creates in his novel. The whole story line is more than just the crazy things that happens in the Roaring Twenties.I absolutely love this novel. This is one of my lifetime good-read books!"
2089,Jason,"What a difference context makes! I read this book two years ago and didn't find it nearly as satisfying as I did this time. On the one hand, I think it was more enjoyable because I already knew the basic plot movement and didn't need to wonder or worry about where the story was going. On the other hand, I had An American Tragedy for comparison.Like An American Tragedy, The Great Gatsby is about money. In many ways James Gatz/Jay Gatsby is like Clyde Griffiths, a boy of humble origins who falls in love with wealth, wealthy culture, and a beautiful and rich girl. In An American Tragedy, Clyde had no chance of moving up the social ladder, but by marrying the right girl, he hoped he could. Gatsby wants to climb the social ladder so that he can marry the girl of his dreams. And Gatsby can and does move up that social ladder . . . to an extent.He is wealthy, there is no doubt about it. Everyone wants to take advantage of his parties and his generosity, but his money is new. And because it's new, it's suspect. All the rumors circulating around Gatsby are because old money has an existing history, a family to point to. Buchanan and Daisy are from old money, and they see Gatsby's parties as vulgar. Gatsby's counterpoint is of course Myrtle whose party is more vulgar and distasteful. Compare both parties to the cultured ease of the opening dinner at the Buchanans. Buchanan doesn't have hydroplanes and a ""circus wagon""--he has converted his garage to a stable, for goodness sake--how cultured is that? And the true social and cultural inroads made by Gatsby are revealed by his funeral. So he can be rich, but he cannot ever have what Buchanan and Daisy have. The money is Daisy's voice that both Gatsby and Nick admire is something you are born into.And what does Daisy see in Buchanan that makes her love him? God knows that he is nothing but an ass to us readers. Gatsby's not the bee's knees, but he sure is more likable than Tom. But to Daisy, Gatsby, for all his charms is not of the same social standing as Tom, no matter how much money he has. It is a doomed love affair from the beginning. At 30, Daisy is not the 18 year old romantic girl ready to run off with Gatsby.I love how Gatsby is not self-made, but that Wolfshiem takes full credit for making him.Nick is fascinating to me as well, but since all my posts are too long as it is, I shall cut myself short. Where does Nick fall in this scale of wealth and social position? He seems both rich from childhood (as the opening sentence suggests) but also rather poorly positioned in his home on West Egg. I love how Nick gets disgusted with just about everyone.And speaking of West Egg, what do you make of the Midwest v. East distinction? It seems to move from a comment about America to something about the East Coast. Is this East v. West distinction echoed in East v. West Egg?I'd write more, but I hate to bore."
2090,Barbara A,"F. Scott Fitzgerald's best, in my opinion."
2091,Douglas Lazorick,Reread and still am amazed by this book. Somehow the novel doesn't feel dated at all even lacking the silly indignities thrust upon it in the most recent movie version. Can't relive the past? Why of course you can.
2092,Randy Tramp,"The StoryWealthy Jay Gatsby, love for Daisy Buchanan and parties on Long Island is the setting. The story is told through the eyes of a neighbor, Nick. The Great Gatsby is one of the great classics.My ThoughtsIn my eyes, a story is great when it stays with me after I’ve read the last page. The Great Gatsby will haunt me for a long time. I loved the simple style, the raw human element and point of view. Gatsby had a love/hate relationship, as did other characters within the book. I’ve heard people that read this book over and over again – I can understand why."
2093,Heathersbookreview,"Why is The Great Gatsby my favorite book? *contains spoilers* Well for starters, this book has so many hidden meanings that have so much importance. For instance, the green light that Gatsby sees at the end of Daisy's dock. Many people argue what this light really means. Some say it is a foreshadow of Gatsby's future and what he wants, others say it is simply a sign of all the wealth that both Daisy and Gatsby have, others say it is a sense of hope. I for one think it is both the sense of hope and also Gatsby's longing for the future he has imagined in his mind. The characters in this book are exquisite. You have Gatsby, the troubled man who seeks a future that will bring him solitude and happiness. You have Nick- the loyal and faithful friend who puts other's worries before his own. You have Daisy- the spoiled careless girl who loves Gatsby but is too much of a coward to leave her abusive husband Tom to be with him. The setting of New York and Long Island is one of magic and money. The extravagant houses, cars, clothes, and wealthy lifestyle make for great drama and lavish thoughts. The story of Gatsby is one of amazement and wonder. Personally I wonder how Gatsby became the way he was, the crazy obsessed thoughts about this imaginative world with Daisy in it. I truly wished Gatsby the best while reading this book because it broke my heart to see him so lonely. The lavish parties, the ginormous mansion, the nice clothes and cars, all for a girl who won't even try in the slightest to be with him. I could reread this book over and over and never tire for many reasons, the main one being the important lesson I learned to never rely on anyone but yourself. You may think this is a morbid thought, but it's true. All those hundred of people who came and used Gatsby and his house for the lavish parties, and when his unbearable demise came, not a single soul except the old and faithful Nick came to his funeral. I learned that if you want the life you imagine and to follow your dreams, you can not rely on others to get you there. If things do not work out the way you want them too, it isn't always the end of the world. However, Gatsby was a man of honor to me. He tried everything he could to try and impress the girl he wanted, showering her in things he knew she liked. He never gave up and frankly I don't think he ever would have. The Great Gatsby is more than a book, it is an art, a life lesson, and more than an outstanding read. "
2094,Ant,"They were right. In my mind at least. Fitzgerald was a truly gifted writer. His many descriptive analogies turn the minds eye towards both the shape & feeling of that which he describes. His use of inner experience to situations was accurate & wise. You could completely believe he was writing out chapters of his own life. The story itself was good but need not have been with the language being all but poetic. But the story was good & left nothing irrational to ponder. He wove a well crafted braid of a story & tied every end off. Was the story about class? Was it an unrequited love story? While it was both those things, I found him telling more the story of a man waiting all his life, playing all his cards for his perfect dream, only to find that it had played out at the moment of giving birth to it, and like all great books, reverberating a truth universal in all our lives.As the final page in the book states:Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by yearrecedes before us.Yep, it deserves to be considered amongst the great books of our time."
2095,Charles Yuan,"The Great Gatsby, written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is among one of the first English book I read. Although it has been almost years since I read this book in 10th grade when I first came to America to study. Coincidentally, this book talked about American dream, and I was a foreigner who also had my own American dream. Gatsby, the protagonist of the novel, was a poor but handsome man. However, he couldn't marry the woman he loved because he didn't own the properties that Daisy wanted. However, many years later, he came back with astonishingly abundant money and properties with the dream to marry Daisy, his former lover. His American dream was half-realized. He became extremely rich, but he didn't realize the fact that Daisy didn't love him anymore. The only thing she loved was his elaborate house and luxury parties he threw every night. The lack of recognition of this fact eventually led him to death. What a sad ending. "
2096,Siddhartha,"--First published on my website--Completed a full book in one day… after a couple of years! Something I used to do so regularly earlier… The Great Gatsby has that un-put-down-able quality to it. Easily some of the best prose I read in English wrapped around a heart rending tale of a man worthy of a Greek tragedy. This is the story of Jay Gatsby, a war veteran from a poor background in the American mid-west. And his obsession with Daisy, a young girl who he thought he loved and who he thought loved him during their flirtation back when he was in the service. He was too naive to realize that all Daisy loved was his uniform and the social stature it bestowed upon him. And Gatsby himself loved the approval he once saw in Daisy's eyes. The approval he yearned all his life. He hated his plebeian background and loved the affluence Daisy seemed surrounded with! A ruinous mistake.When after the war he is off to Oxford for some reason, Daisy gets married to Tom, a rich man with aristocratic background. Sure it breaks his heart. But he deludes himself that he can change the past. He feels he just has to make more money than Tom to win Daisy’s heart. Gatsby makes good money, by hook or crook and buys a sprawling mansion in NY state just across the sea to Daisy and Tom’s own sprawling estate. He organizes elaborate parties every week in hope that Daisy shows up in one of those one day. He simply fails to realize the protocols that differentiated old money and new money. He befriends Nick Caraway, his neighbor and Daisy’s cousin who is also the narrator and plays an important in the story by arranging a meeting between Daisy and Gatsby. Daisy introduces Nick to Jordan Baker, another Louisville girl and we see how Gatsby would have fallen for Daisy mirrored in the interaction between Jordan and Nick. But Nick mentions in his own exquisitely poetic words that though he felt he was in love with Jordan, his internal deliberative mechanism prevented him from drawing that conclusion. Pity poor Gatsby who never had such defenses, and he pays too high a price for that. There are other lives that are ruined too.This novel is a stunning commentary on the lack of morality, the hypocrisy and the insensitivity of the rich in 1920’s America, but it has a universal appeal to it, even after 90 years of being fist published, a lot of revulsion it evokes in the readers towards certain characters is because of their familiarity in every contemporary society obsessed with money and possessions. It gives it a timeless appeal. One review I read in Goodreads claims that Gatsby would have had it his way had he lived in 21st century. I find myself agreeing to this viewpoint. He fitted the celebrity bracket so easily that would have meant he would be at home with today’s culture!The best lines from the novel which probably has the most liked quotes ever!“Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope.” “They’re a rotten crowd’, I shouted across the lawn. ‘You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together.” “No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.” “She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’s full of-“I hesitated.“Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly.That was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of money-that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it.” “Thirty--the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning brief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair.” “They were careless people, *** and *** —they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.” "
2097,Starlight,amazing :)
2098,Amy Sprenger,Can you believe I never read this until now?! Shameful.
2099,Draven,"One of my favorite books of all-time by one of my favorite authors of all time! It never gets old, still completely relatable, as we continue to be a society falling from grace once again."
2100,Karen Bannister,"This American classic by the rich voice of F. Scott Fitzgerald was made into a 2013 movie starring Leonard DiCaprio. It was the presence of this story in the media, combined with the serendipity of the seeing the book on the shelf at the library, that encouraged me to read it. I understood, by the end of the first few pages, why this is touted as canonic and Fitzgerald's finest piece: the language is breathtaking. This beauty runs throughout the novel, a lovely play with words.Take the oft quoted closing sentence as an example. IT is by far my favourite line from literature.""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.""Many people have written interpretative essays about this book; no doubt brighter people than me but I have read that some call it a cautionary tale of the American dream, a tale of angst and turmoil analogous to America in the 20s, when this novel takes place.Other critics have drawn parallels to Fitzgerald's own life bringing him in line with the book's narrator. These ideas seem both important and immaterial to me - I think I loved this novel because it was a breathtaking example of good literature. Not only of the poetic, and humerous irreverent way Fitzgerald spun his prose, but for the plot that reveals the flaws and holes in people the way we are all just longing for something else, something idyllic, something in some ways that can never actually be. You might call the ending pessimistic and yet there is a great deal of hope in being drawn back to the past but with the experience, and insight of the present."
2101,Alexandra Chusseau,"Impossible, impossible de m'arrêter de le lire. Bien qu'il diffère sur quelques points du film j'ai adoré l'histoire. Le caractère mélancolique de Nick peut paraître à certains moment très froid mais c'est ce qui m'a fait aimer ce livre encore plus. "
2102,Hope,"The prose and language of this novel is to die for. It is such a multilayered and authentic novel. This fatalistic story of nostalgia, love, and class is one that I hold dearest to my heart. "
2103,Becky,"I loved this book.I didn't expect to. I've heard so many good things about it. People have recommended it to me left, right, and centre. I thought I'd find it dull. I've put off reading it for years. Just because SURELY it couldn't be that good? How wrong I was. It is so easy to see why this book is a classic. The characterisation and scene setting are incredible. I felt like I was there the whole time, mixed up in the world of 1920s America. It was so easy to picture.I loved the storyline itself too. Just the right amount of pace and the right number of twists and turns. This book is now one of my favourites. I'm going to be one of those people recommending it left right and centre. Just beautiful. "
2104,Olivia Alberts,"The reason why I decided to use The Great Gatsby as my prize winner review novel is because I had watched the movie quite a long time ago and I really liked it so I though it would be interesting to read the book and compare the difference. The book actually wasn't as good as the movie but I still enjoyed it, the reason I thought it wasn't as good is because the book confused me quite a bit in the first four chapters but then I started to figure it out. I got confused as of the characters and I didn't even know who the first person or the one narrarating the story was but I figured it out eventually. Some thing I learned from this book is that people aren't always who you think they are, for example at the start of the book I liked daisy and her personality but at the end I changed my mind to think she was rude and arrogant with everything Gatsby did for her she couldn't even say she loved him! A character I found interesting was Gatsby because he had been through to much in his life and he had some very good times to which is why it seems he is so caught up in the past and trying to restore those moments that he enjoyed so much. I think the great Gatsby is a great story with lots of romance and drama "
2105,Amina,"""They were careless people, Tom and daisy -they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelesness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made...""This is the kind of books that takes you in its depths, you live it, react to it.. While reading, you get so absorbed by the story that you experience different feelings, anger, sadness, disappointment, you're wondering and sometimes even dreaming... One of my best readings for sure..So my dearest delusional Mr.Gatsby, ""Can we repeat the past?"""
2106,Cristiana,"Now the film hullabaloo is dying, we can relish Fitzgerald's richly absorbing text on its own merits. Published in 1925, Gatsby is among a handful of novels combining greatness with brevity that you can enjoy over and over again. There are a host of reasons why Fitzgerald's gripping fantasy of new money, self-invention and obsessive love evades the repeated assaults of Hollywood. Without actually reciting the book, no film could equal the two-page list of hangers-on who attend Gatsby's parties: ""And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G. Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife…"" A whole stratum of society is depicted in the litany.Fitzgerald's descriptions are terse, vivid and surprising. He conveys tranquillity (""Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the women preceded us"") as effectively as sudden violence: ""Making a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his open hand.""There are notably accurate accounts of drunkenness. Films may come and go but Gatsby remains a fresh-minted pleasure."
2107,Christy,"Brilliant book. Fitzgerald touches upon every human vanity in this book & takes the reader on a journey of love, heartache, & self loathing with that writers of today cannot begin to compare. A must read!"
2108,Sam Lile,"The Mysterious GatsbyAre there limits as to what wealth can accomplish? Can the past be relived? Can innocence be a sharper weapon than greed? All of these questions are raised in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby. Set in New York at the height of the roaring twenties, protagonist Nick Carraway begins his journey up the social ladder in an area filled with wealth and poverty, Rolls Royces and Model T’s, mobsters and miners. A mysterious man befriends Nick by the name of Gatsby. Little is actually known about the man, but there is no shortage of wildly extravagant rumors in regards to where he and his money come from. The one thing that is know about Gatsby, he throws wild and extravagant parties. Despite his reputation to be a crowd pleaser the man keeps his circle of friends rather small, which leaves Nick wondering, why me, why have I been invited the world of Gatsby?I found the story extremely intriguing; coming from someone who honestly does not love to read I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I was riveted by the mystery and uncertainty. I could not put the book down. Truthfully I had seen the film before I read the novel and for once I was surprised at how true the film stayed to the original text, down to the all seeing eyes of Dr. T. j. Eckleburg that silently observe in both works and the contrast between the city and the desolate land surrounding it. I found the themes to still be applicable today despite the novel being almost ninety years old. All threads still apply from the American obsession with greed to the desire to recreate past events, as well as ignorance causing one’s downfall. The emotional appeals and mystery kept me glued to the book."
2109,Allison Chan,"After finishing the last page, I truly think that  The Great Gatsby  is one of America's, or even the world's, greatest classics. F. Scott Fitzgerald takes the 1920s of America, when ""gin was the national drink and sex the national obsession"", when the wish of all Americans was to attend lavish parties of fancy food and drinks (like cocktails, etc. with gin) and dance in great ballrooms, along with the addiction of finding a true love, someone who you would settle down with happily. This period of time is then turned into the story of Jay Gatsby and his great love for beautiful yet careless Daisy Buchanan, and Gatsby's determination to make the past life repeat: when he and Daisy were young and so in love.The story was very well-written, with smooth transitions from paragraph to paragraph and no random points there were left undeveloped. I also liked how there was a lot of foreshadowing, because it helps to create suspense and even more interest in what will happen next.Finally...a lot of things that were unexpected happened. I had thought that Gatsby and Daisy would along well, considering how much of an arrogant idiot Tom was, and how it didn't really seem that they loved each other too much. However, then there was...the huge turning point, the argument between Gatsby and Tom, and then...the final event, probably the climax. I liked this, because nothing, other than probably the argument, had been expected at all. And I think that good stories need surprises like the ones written by F. Scott Fitzgerald in his masterpiece,  The Great Gatsby. "
2110,Amrita,Wow 
2111,Exocet,"If you are like me and hate all this glitter fancy fake show of a lifestyle that all the rich people live with their cars and brand luxuries and gold champagne even nowadays, you will first of all not like The Great Gatsby. You will be disgusted of it. But what you will realize as you hang on, is that you actually only hate the world of the decadent, rich and rotten people pictured in this book. You will more and more sympathize with Nick and you will fall in love with Gatsby. You will fall in love with him because he portrays that one pure character with a clean heart of gold with no cracks in a rotten society that is already sinking in its own cracks.Anyone who still believes there is good and pure souls out in this world of liars and betrayers will love to read this book."
2112,James Loranger,"I first read Gatsby 40+ years ago when I was in college. I respected its reputation, I admired Fitzgerald's technical skill, but I didn't really like it. I had read it immediately after Hemingway's ""The Sun Also Rises"", which had changed the way I looked at EVERYTHING, and I think I was disappointed that Gatsby did not have the same effect on me.At any rate, I reread it so that I could teach it to high school seniors, and this time I was open to what it had to offer. It is one if the greatest novels of the 20th Century, and a masterpiece of romanticism undercut by irony, cynicism, and pain. Jay Gatsby is one of the great fools of literature, yet he is presented in such a way that one must empathize with him even as one marvels at his foolishness. Nick Carroway is the great narrator character who, like Conrad's Marlow, is changed forever as much by the telling of the story as by the events themselves. Daisy, Jordan, and Tom transcend the stereotypes of the "" idle rich"" to become archetypes of the American Character at its most flawed.Sadly, Fitzgerald never came close to this level of writing again. Unlike Hemingway, there would be no late period redemption for him; no ""Old Man and the Sea"" or ""Islands in the Stream"" to cap off his career. But there is ""Gatsby"", and that is enough."
2113,Mirna Abifaker,"When picking up this classic, I was prepared for a novel that would be difficult to understand with complex language and a hard-to-follow plot. It proved to be none of the above. The Great Gatsby is indeed great, the novel portrays the Jazz Age in America and is based upon the self-made multimillionaire, Jay Gatsby. Gatsby is known for his lavish parties surrounded by hundreds of people, yet fails to make any true friendships apart from his neighbor, Nick. Nick is the cousin of Daisy who Gatsby longs for and does everything in his power to be with her. Daisy is married to Tom who is having an affair with Mertyl. The love story in the novel is like a love pentagon! One night, they all decide to head to town with Daisy and Gatsby in one car, and the rest in the other car. This night, Daisy hits Mertyl with the car and the blame is put on Gatsby. Daisy runs away with Tom while Wilson, Mertyl's husband finds Gatsby and shoots him. It was an unexpected ending, to say the least. Sadly at Gatsby's funeral, the only people there are Nick, his father, and the servants of his house. As Nick mentions in the novel (as the narrator) the people surrounding Gatsby are all very superficial and shallow, careless characters who seem to have no worry about Gatsby or anything else for that matter. I absolutely loved reading this classic novel and am so surprised it took me this long to pick it up. Fitzgerald wrote with such eloquence and detail incorporating symbols and themes throughout the novel. I am looking forward to watching the movie in the next couple of days!"
2114,Doug,"Just re-read for the first time since 1981 in High School. As I read, I remembered that this was the book used to introduce me to literary analysis. Some wonderful lines in the book and the overall story is masterpiece. Oddly enough, in some ways this reminds me of the Death of Ivan Illych (and how Illych loses his humanity in dying). I love this book on so many levels."
2115,Bucket,"I went to high school in the US (and read everything I was assigned, I swear!) and was an English major in college, and somehow, some way, I never had to read this book. I don't know how I threaded that needle, but I did. So I'm happy to say that now I can stop hanging my head in shame and join basically every single one of my Goodreads friends in having read this book. And I enjoyed it. ""Can't repeat the past?"" he cried incredulously. ""Why of course you can!"" To me, this is sort of the crux of who Gatsby is. He is ultra-rich and mysterious and seems to have endless connections and relationships, but he's really a naive and lovestruck man who believes all things are possible if he just wants them bad enough. To be fair, his wild success financially supports this idea. But everyone knows that the past can't be repeated, or revisited, or changed. This is why nostalgia and regret exist. But Gatsby truly believes what he says here, and truly believes that Daisy will soon be his and his alone, and truly believes that perfection both exists and is attainable. On the first day that Daisy and Gatsby rekindle their romance, Nick says: ""There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams -- not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion."" Daisy, and her husband Tom, are the exact opposite of Gatsby, other than also being wildly rich. They are not naive at all, are perhaps even jaded, and do their best to exploit the world they live in and the people around them. ""Her voice is full of money,"" Gatsby says of Daisy and this is the truth. Were he not now rich, she wouldn't give him the time of day. There's an interesting moment when the novel describes their prior relationship, and why Daisy decides to quit waiting for Gatsby to make some money and moves on to marry Tom: ""She wanted her life shaped now, immediately -- and the decision must be made by some force -- of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality -- that was close at hand."" At first, it makes me think of the impatience to grow up and move forward that comes with being a teenager/early 20s. But it also means that Daisy has a need to be noticed by society and fawned over. She's ready to be a socialite. The most interesting sentence about Tom and Daisy though is this one, which describes exactly what happens in the novel: ""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy -- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made."" The theme of time is loosely carried throughout the novel, mostly by Gatsby and his attachment to his past love with Daisy and desperate need to make it his future as well. The closing sentence of the novel emphasizes this sense of futility of trying to re-acquire what is teasingly out of reach because time has passed: ""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter -- tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther...So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.""Themes: America, New York, 1920s, wealth, love, deception, time"
2116,Elise,"I read this book in preparation for seeing the movie with a few of my girlfriends. Unlike most, I'd never read this book in high school and really had no idea what it was about, so I had ZERO expectations going in (and specifically tried to avoid movie previews as well).The book won me over 100%. It romanced me slowly in the beginning, to where I'd think about going back to read it often. But then, towards the end, I just couldn't put it down. The writing was flawless and exciting and magical. The story line sucked you right into the times and gave you just enough information and meat in the descriptions and information, but didn't over-tell the story and let the reader season and imply to taste. I am so glad I read the book prior to seeing the movie as I feel the reactions of others who did so as well, varied drastically from those who went into the movie never having read the book - or at least not having read it in the last decade (or two). In our group of three girls and our boyfriends & husbands, the girls had read it, the men had not- and they were disappointed with the movie saying it was overly long and about nothing. We all balked at the reactions as we had been gushing since leaving the theater. The difference between movies and books, I realized a bit that day, is that people expect movies to hand them storylines on a silver platter and hand hold them through the whole plot so they know how to feel. With books, people realize that a lot more will probably be inferred, or left to the imagination. They're lead to the story and the theme, and the lessons, but left to mull over what they actually are on their own. The movie brought the book to life while still keeping true to how books tell stories. This was the first book-to-movie adaptation (where I had read the book) that I walked away from feeling that it enhanced my experience as opposed to being a thorough let down and disappointment. I credit that to the talented writing and story of F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the talent of the movie director and screenwriter for staying true to it. "
2117,Maryam AlNasser,Ugh. I loved this. I loved this so much.
2118,Rainy Day Riches,"First off, The Great Gatsby was a phenomenal piece of writing; Fitzgerald’ descriptions were fresh and verbose (which is becoming harder to find) and Nick’s outlook on the world was… arresting, to say the least.I’ll limit myself to three things about the novel that I thought were interesting:1. Nick Carraway is one of the most interesting people I’ve ever “met.” His observations at times confused me to no end and at others had me laughing so hard that I couldn’t even make sounds, so I just sat there clapping like a performance seal. He’s a sweet pushover on the outside, but his mind is a steel rapier, cold and unforgiving. He really is a wonderful storyteller, though; one description of Mrs. Wilson (Tom Buchanan’s “girl”) seemed to me to describe her very well: “she looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.” When is the last time you heard someone kiss a dog with ecstasy?? But the word fits so perfectly within the scene that you don’t even notice how strange it sounds until you take it out of context.Another, unrelated something-I-thought-you-should-know is this: within the next few hours, Nick ends up in bed with another guest of Mrs. Wilson’s, a photographer. A male photographer. I’m totally fine with being gay, don’t freak out on me. The point I’m bringing up is that I’m not sure whether Nick let himself be taken to the photographer’s room or he actively went there, which still begs the question of whether they actually slept together at all. Isn’t homosexuality a little forward for 1925?2. Daisy’s voice is the defining feature of her character. The first half of the book was spent worshiping Daisy’s contralto like it was phone sex. I’m a little ashamed of it, but it took me until Gatsby literally said “her voice is full of money“ for me to understand why. Daisy Buchanan is on a different plane than her cousin (Nick) and Gatsby altogether. Her world bursting to the seams with money and power, and throughout the book she doesn’t seem to really grasp the situation at hand through the golden haze until it’s too late and Gatsby is throwing everything he’s got at her. So of course she does what any sensible woman of the time would do and runs away from it. Does she even know that Gatsby is dead?3. The Great Gatsby’s dream/life didn’t last very long. Gatsby didn’t live aside from that month or two that he courted Daisy in 1917, not really. The rest of his life was imagination and preparation for starting it over again; he was obsessed with the past and had convinced himself that his wasted life could be redone, if only Daisy would come with him back to Louisville. the trouble was that Daisy, and the rest of the world, moved on without him. Even his house seems to he holding on to the old days-Renaissance rooms and parlors, a “factual imitation of some Hotel de Ville in Normandy.” It makes you wonder if, in the end, Gatsby realized that the culmination of his life had been reached, and if he had simply allowed Mr. Wilson to shoot him."
2119,Greg,Re-read in 4ish hours on 6/21/12. Still a lovely thing. Moreso without forced educational interference. 
2120,Dana Burkey,Just as good as the first time I read it! And now I need to totally have a 20's party!!!!!!
2121,Rachel Evans,"Out of all the books in the American canon of literature, two are most considered “The Great American Novel.”: Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Huck Finn and this slender beast, The Great Gatsby. Now, I haven’t read Huck Finn since eighth grade, but I have to side with those that favor Fitzgerald’s most popular novel, perhaps not for it’s greatness or novel-ness, but because at its heart it is completely and wholly American.The novel tells the story of a young man from the Midwest named Nick Carraway who comes to Long Island to live in the less fashionable West Egg, across the bay from Tom and Daisy Buchanan and right next door to the titular Jay Gatsby. We’re never told much about Nick except for a smidge of backstory, but the horror of his misadventures at Tom and Daisy’s house is very clear. They’re horrifically boring, dull, and listening to either of them talk is like pulling teeth. But when Nick goes across the bay to Gatsby’s, the world of the American Dream comes alive. The parties are spectacular, the liquor flows free, and, most importantly, Gatsby’s parties have Gatsby.Gatsby serves as the main character that is what makes this book, as the title suggests, Great. He stares off at the green light at the end of the bay because it symbolizes not only his dream, but the American Dream. We think that if we just push a little hard, go a little longer, that we can reach our own green light, but we never realize that that dream isn’t in front of us. We left it behind in the dust a long time ago and creating a perfect picture of the past does nothing to create the perfect vision Gatsby has for the future. He cannot have Daisy or the life and love that he so longs for, even though he has enough money to buy gold cars and enough whisky to crash them. But he refuses to believe that, and that, ultimately is what makes this novel so wholly American.It is hard not to walk away from Gatsby without a sense of hopelessness, after having seen a man with, as Carraway says, “such a talent for hope” get cast down, but it is also hard not to hang on to Gatsby’s hope, to believe that we, too, will be allright in the end, and that makes all the difference."
2122,Kristen,The first time I read The Great Gatsby (at fifteen) I didn't care for it.The second time I read it (at twenty-two) I rather liked it.The third time I read it (at thirty-one) I finally realized it is a masterpiece. 
2123,Julio,"Sin duda alguna, uno de mis top ten de toda la vida. La enésima lectura, esta vez en su lengua original. Y el mismo dolor de siempre, de ese inconmensurable amor, idealizado y más grande que la vida misma, destrozado por el rechazo y la realidad. Construir un imperio sobre la base de un sueño y que el sueño se evapore, sólo puede terminar en locura o muerte. Muchas escenas (que a veces se mezclan con retazos brumosos de esa vieja película de los años 70, con Robert Redford y Mia Farrow) quedan grabadas en mi voluble mente. Las cortinas movidas por el viento, flotando suavemente, al conocer el lector a Daisy. El traje blanquísimo y la expresión imposible de leer, parado en la gradas de su enorme mansión, llena de lujo, pero vacía y fría en realidad, de Gatsby, el enigma de Gatsby. El drama, el auto, el choque, la muerte. Y la piscina, con el cuerpo flotando y de nuevo las cortinas, esta vez ocultando al asesino, al suicida.Y la delicadeza y ternura con que Fitzgerald crea a sus personajes, la pulcritud de la estructura de este pequeño libro, la perfección del sentido de la historia, lo acercan (como a Lolita o De ratones y de hombres) a la perfección. Una perfección que es el fruto terrible del vacío de lo inalcanzable. Del dolor de lo vano."
2124,Jennifer (aka EM),"I read my high school copy - just about every one of its brittle, yellowing pages marked up; each colour and number circled, as though Fitzgerald's ham-fisted symbolism was the most important thing. I certainly remembered the novel most vividly for all its golds and pinks and whites and 12s and flowers and ashes, and of course for the lassitudinous debauchery; that feeling that can only be described as ""Gatsbyesque"" with the full range of connotation that describing something as Kafkaesque has.I re-read this because I wanted to remember the original, as it was clearly (and directly mentioned as) an influence on Chabon's The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, which I just finished yesterday and enjoyed very much. I'm glad I still had it lying around on a bookshelf, available to be read for the broader story which I can now more fully appreciate.It bears re-reading for many reasons, but of course mostly for the dissolution. And disillusion. The hypocrisy and petty cruelties of the ""careless people"", who ""smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.""Talk about a story that holds up well (Occupy East and West Egg!). ""Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they'll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between ..."". Well, Tom says black and white; but fill in the blanks with any contemporary Fox News-inspired illustration of the world going to hell in a handbasket. I don't know how this makes me feel: 1) I marvel at Fitzgerald's prescience, writing before the Wall Street crash of `29 but seeing the decadence of the age as a sure sign, if not of it, of something momentous to come; 2) I give in to that sinking feeling of inevitable, cyclical doom coming upon us, as similar as it feels to our current age of decadence, greed and selfishness.What a perfect read for Dec 30th, the end of such a politically, socially, environmentally tumultous year! I know The Great Gatsby has a revered place in American lit, especially if not primarily for that final few pages when Fitzgerald eulogizes in a sad and bitter summary the loss of the American dream, from ""the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors' eyes--a fresh, green breast of the new world"" to the inutterable brilliance of: ""the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us.""But to this Canuck, as powerful as those final pages are and as big (and contemporary) as that idea is, the story that comes before it -- the more personal story -- is even better. These characters' amorality is so pervasive they are completely unable to act in their own best interests, beyond satisfying their most basic and immediate physical or emotional needs. They can't identify what is making them so sad, or what will make them happy. They are caught in their own lies and mean hypocrisies; trapped by their own social position and empty aspirations; cycling through the endlessly-repetitive and unfulfilling pursuit of sex, power, money, material things. And most of all, they are unable to care for each other as they could and should, and they don't realize that it is that which is at the core of their sadness, this 'takerism', this total absence of compassion, which really marks their failures of character. For they all fail - they fail each other, they fail themselves. All but for Nick, I suppose, although he is as buffeted by events and as amoral as any of them. (He has the good fortune to be narrating the tale and therefore can pretend he`s learned some kind of lesson. And maybe he has. Discuss.) They all just get it SO WRONG. Most tellingly, some (most) of them never face the consequences. And it is here that the depth of Fitzgerald's cynicism shines through so clearly. God, it's like a huge weight bearing down on the reader, how cynical this novel is. It's not just disgust for the selfishness and cruelty being portrayed, or even sadness for the characters whose lives have ended - or whose lives continue in a compassionless vacuum devoid of meaning or purpose, which may be worse - but the very real sense that there is no possibility of redemption through insight for any of them. This is quite possibly one of the most hopeless books I think I've ever read.For me, that`s why - as Elizabeth says in her fantastic review - Tom, Wilson, Myrtle, Nick, Mr. Gatz, they all break my heart.What a great book."
2125,J Sam,Astonishing amazing novel!
2126,Blaze Stout,"The Great Gatsby I would Rate 5 stars. I would recommend the book to any friend I have, The great Gatsby has so many ways that people can connect and enjoy the book. The book to me is about the struggle between a man’s decision of possession and people. This book is a must read and with the new movie coming out this summer I believe a lot of people will be reading it to get ready for the movie.F. Scott Fitzgerald is the author of The Great Gatsby and has written an American classic about the struggle between choosing possession and people. Mr. Jay Gatsby is one of the main characters in the book and he is also one of the characters that not everyone knows about. Mr. Gatsby in his younger years went to college, then fell in love and then had to go to war. When he went to war is was told by a Ms. Daisy that she would wait for him… Gatsby returned to find out she was married and he was crushed. Gatsby from then on did everything in his power to win Daisy back to him. The three most important events to win daisy back were Gatsby buying a house in West Egg right next to Daisy, Gatsby would go out into the night and watch Daisy’s Green Lantern all night. Gatsby would always host parties at his mansion in hope to Daisy coming over to his house and them being reacquainted. The last event was when Gatsby used one of his friends Nick to get Daisy over for tea at nicks house, it was just Daisy and Gatsby in nicks little place and they caught up and eventually started seeing each other more often. "
2127,Evelyn,"Loved loved loved the writing in this book! The descriptions were so vivid I would get lost in the pictures in my mind and forget to read on. Some moments later I would come back to reality and be startled to find a book in my hands.This passage is describing Gatsby's smile. It makes me want to BE this smile.""He smiled understandingly - much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced - or seemed to face - the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.""With writing like this, I find the story less important to my enjoyment of the book. I do feel very sorry for Gatsby, I think he was extremely insecure, and sadly was surrounded by people who were only interested in what he could do for them, with no thought ever of reciprocating."
2128,Lizzie Jones,"I don't love anyone in this story. I don't love Gatsby because I think he's an insecure fool and I pity him. I don't love Daisy because I think she lacks any sort of backbone and self-possession, which means she also lacks compassion in any form. I don't love Tom because he is a colossal jerk. I don't love Jordan because she's sort of boring. I don't love Nick because for someone who claims to not be judgmental, he sure likes to judge people. And yet...This story is captivating and sad and depressing and completely draws me in every time I read it. There is so much to deconstruct and analyze and puzzle out. There is so much that has been said and so much still to say about these people and this lifestyle and the American Dream and the green light at the end of the dock. It's a winner, and I hate it, but I love it. I recommend it to people that like deep literature but advise that you stay away if you're looking for something inspiring and heartfelt. Fitzgerald doesn't write with his heart, he writes with his imaginative, brilliant, sad mind. "
2129,Julia," “The Great Gatsby” was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald and first published in 1925. The story is set in Long Island and New York City in 1922 and is told through the eyes of Nick Carraway, the nextdoor neighbor of a man named Jay Gatsby. Gatsby is known for his lavish and unforgettable parties, though often times his guests do not even get the chance to meet him because of the size and casualness of the get-togethers. He is portrayed as the man who lives life for the moment, but as the book progresses, it becomes clear how wrapped up in the past he actually is. Through a series of small scenes and significant situations, the reader comes to realize that Gatsby fell in love with a woman years ago who is now married and named Daisy Buchanan. Even after many years, Gatsby is still infatuated with her. Nick happens to be the cousin of Daisy and, in the Summer of 1922, Gatsby realizes he may have the chance to see her again and fill the hole that has been created by the one thing that has been missing from his life, his ‘true love.’ Fitzgerald’s writing is the perfect balance between poetic and understandable; it quickly pulls the reader in. Unlike many books, the best moments in “The Great Gatsby” are not in the longest scenes, but in the simple descriptions of seemly insignificant moments that actually tell you all you need to know to understand the characters. This book is great for people who love the Roaring Twenties, strong character development throughout books, or short metaphors and statements that will stay with them long after they reach the last page. 	It is hard for me to critique this book because it has become one of my favorites, but I suppose one thing that could have been developed better was Nick’s relationship with Jordan Baker. I think the reason Fitzgerald decided to throw in this side plot, but not develop it much, was to add something to Nick’s character, but at the same time not take away from Gatsby’s love for Daisy. After all, the whole book is Nick describing Jay Gatsby through his eyes and Gatsby’s relationship with Daisy. Had there been even one scene that focused only on Jordan and Nick, the reader’s interest may have begun to shift from Gatsby to Nick, or at least created a want for more information on the other couple. Still, it would have been interesting to hear a little more about them. Another thing that I thought could have been done in a slightly more successful way was the ending of the book, the last ten pages or so. I was still interested in everything Nick was saying and agreed with the choice’s Fitzgerald made concerning the characters for the most part, though I was hoping for some hint at Daisy’s response, even if it had been presented in a “Only years later did I speak to Daisy about the incident...” kind of way, but I did feel it was slightly detached from the rest of the book. I am not a hundred-percent sure why I felt this way, maybe I was still processing the last main event involving Gatsby. In any case, I think ending the book with a quote from Gatsby would have been a good last line or maybe just a line that summed everything up from Nick. Something about Gatsby’s parties or that Summer or the fact that at the end Nick went from being disgusted with Gatsby to realizing that Gatsby had needed him that Summer in a matter of days. That Summer, Nick was the kind of friend to Gatsby that he had not had in awhile and the end sequence clearly conveys that to the reader. People that had know Gatsby for years never really understood him the way Nick did after a matter of months."
2130,Holly Peacock,"What a desperate, beautiful piece of work. The prose is sparkling whether it is about the glitz of Gatsby or the drudgery of Carraway's socialite life. Read at the ripe age of 29 it seems predictable, but only because it is an exemplar in its genre and had been copied to death. The ending is fabulous-it is what would happen with humans instead of the narrative we expect. Even better, it took me two hours to finish all told (with breaks in between chapters)... One sentence review: Sadness compiles upon despair until we are left hollow but satisfied.(view spoiler)[Categorized as a Romance (which I do) it breaks the de facto one true rule: the people in love end up together. Despite this flagrant violation of modern sensibilities it holds up as a true gem of the genre. Many of the traditional romance rules are upheld: the hero and heroine are attractive and attracted to each other, the impediment-the husband-is properly brutish and unthinkingly cruel but also sympathetic. The couple gets together but is also torn apart. There is the right amount of sex in a book for me, which is to say none that is explicit but enough implicit passion to suggest it satisfactorily. Gatsby bucks the stereotypical hero trend. He is not stoic, then pink and squishy, then strong and reliable. He is an untouchable man until Daisy's arrival. He then begins unraveling by inches. Gatsby's sadness and pathetic tendencies are at first touching, then painful, almost repulsive, and never regains his composure. He is a man who works so hard for the one thing he wants, and is rewarded with misery. Daisy is a shadow of a character, which not only expected for the time period but almost necessary for the story. This is not Daisy's story-she is merely an object to be coveted, loved, tempted, stolen, and returned. Such as it is, Daisy is still portrayed in a multi-faceted way. We know why Gatsby loves her, why Tom loves her, and why she loves them both-but doesn't. She is strong enough to have an affair, which is nice but ultimately flees back to ""safety"" i.e. money when the truth is revealed- a very old and discouraging trope, but fitting for the time period and ending. (hide spoiler)]"
2131,Melissa Biszak,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald takes place during the roaring twenties and it is suspense drama with romance. The main message of the book is ""the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep being poor."" The rich people get away with everything and the poor people have to suffer. Fitzgerald made Nick the main character and everyone is connected to him somehow. It shows the many different sides of the story through Nick's eyes. The book details the seven peoples lives through killing, adultery, cheating, materialism and dishonesty. These people are all connected but all with secrets. Nick is the focus point and everyone is connected to him. Nick's second cousin is Daisy. Daisy is married to Tom. Tom and Nick knew each other in college. Tom introduces Nick to his mistress, Myrtle. Myrtle is married to George Wilson. George Wilson met Nick because of Tom. Nick is neighbors with Gatsby. Jordan goes to Gatsby's parties. Nick is in a relationship with Jordan. Jordan lives with Daisy and Tom. Daisy is having an affair with Gatsby. Nick knows all the secret information about everyone's personal lives, while others are clueless.I loved this book. I loved the hidden messages. This book teaching morals,respect, right and wrong and what not to do and what not to do. I likes that real people could be in these situations, it was realistic. It made me want to read it in one sitting. I recommend everyone reading this book it is a true classic. "
2132,Aerien,"Várni akartam az értékeléssel, mivel egy új kiadást olvastam és a fordítás borzalmas volt, és kíváncsi voltam, hogy egy korábbi fordítás milyen.Hát, jobb, az biztos. :) De most a nyelvtanra és a fordításra nem térek ki, hanem most csak a könyvről fogok mesélni.A felétől tudtam, mi lesz a vége és reménykedtem benne, hogy még sem fog bekövetkezni. Nick jó mesélő, pont annyit árul el ami szükséges, és annyit hallgat el amiről nekünk nem kell tudni. Tetszett nagyon hogy sok az utalás, és nekem kell rájönnöm hogy mit is akar a szereplő vagy a helyzet. Nem lökték elém az egész történést, és magyarázták meg, mint sok könyvben, hanem hagyták, hogy én vonjam le a tanulságot. Ez egy tökéletes könyv arra, hogy egy magyar órán beszélgetni lehessen róla.Két kedvencem volt a könyvben Nick és Jay Gatsby. :) De csak Nick volt az életrevaló, Gatsby nem. Gatsby nem az álmainak élt, hanem a tökéletes ábrándjainak, és ez okozta a vesztét. Jó üzlet ember volt, és jó ember is, de nem volt abba a világba való, és semelyikbe sem, csakis akkor maradhatott volna életben, ha nem kergeti, a nem létező ábránd képeit. Sajnáltam ezért, mert egy tökéletes férfi volt, odaadó, hűséges, vendégszerető (még ha hátsó szándékai is voltak :)).Itt a karakterek egy-egy típust képviseltek. Daisy az életunt gazdag asszony, Tom a felsőbbrendűség komplexű gazdag férfi, Gatsby az álmait( és ábrándjait) hajszoló és megkapó férfi, Nick a lehetőség a kiugrásra, a jobb életre. A többiek, akiket részletesen vagy sem, felsorolt és bemutatott az író, pedig a közönyös, élvezeteket hajszoló emberek, akik minden korban megtalálhatók.Betekintést nyerhettünk a válság előtti Amerikába, ahol dőlt a lé, folytak a partik, és emberek haltak meg úgy, hogy csak egy ember volt a temetésükön. Szívtelen egy világ, de nem különbözik a maitól. Örök igazságokat írt le az író. :)Nem sokára megnézem a filmet is, mivel írtam valahol, hogy egy nagyon jó forgatókönyvet lehet belőle kihozni, mert maga a könyv esemény dús (szerintem az) és pörgős. Úgy hogy lesz még egy kiegészítő, összehasonlító értékelés is."
2133,Trisha,"There are nice novels, and then there are magnificent novels. The Great Gatsby is a master act; deceptively appearing as a class critique really to disguise an ethereal, almost spiritual core. Gatsby is a classic pariah: he doesn't belong anywhere socially or economically because he operates outside the realm of propriety. His motivations lie not in pretense, but an exceptional devotional love which dictates his every move and prevents him from truly participating in the garish world he creates. Beneath the boisterous, profane picture of the American upper class in the 1920's, is a ringing act of truth and worship. Gatsby in his sincerity, pursues a divine love which he cannot consummate in a society driven by deceit and superficiality. This is why Gatsby is a beautiful, breath taking tragedy. Gatsby explores the inherent selfishness and worldliness of human motivations in juxtaposition with a simple, pure, obsessive and doomed desire. "
2134,Annalise Gill,"I decided to read The Great Gatsby because of its famous reputation as one of the top ten books of all time. Although it was fascinating, it wasn't exactly my ""cup of tea"". The Great Gatsby is very interesting in regards to the fact that Fitzgerald puts enormous meaning behind everything he writes, and there is a lot of meanings subtly presented for the reader to divulge. Also, I agree with it's portrayal as a cautionary tale of the American Dream. Jay Gatsby is a poor man who reinvents himself as a mysterious millionaire in hopes of winning the heart of the beautiful rich girl, Daisy Buchanan, he fancied ever since they were young. But because he did so in a dishonest way, Gatsby's actions had terrible consequences. Despite it not being one of my favorite books, I gave it four stars because I felt like this book was well written, had good flow and good plot movement, wonderful use of descriptive vocabulary, and the author had a good understanding when it comes to affairs of the heart. This moral subject matter in this book was all about honesty, and I felt that he said a great deal when it comes to people who are dishonest with others and themselves and those who live behind a facade."
2135,Claudia Sanchez,One of my great great loves of my life. 
2136,Marcie,"And my exploration of the Lost Generation continues as we read this for book club...One book club friend asked why High School English reads books such as this. Since I've heard this question from more than one friend more than once, I thought I'd turn this review into an answer...1) Well-Written Literature Because Fitzgerald's writing is amazing. There are no trite, worn out cliches. You see the world of the Jazz Age wealthy with clarity and brilliance. After reading popular novels, classics such as this are like fresh air to my brain - nourishing and enjoyable without guilt.2) Depth Because the surface story contains analogies, symmetries, and foreshadowing that are only apparent on rereadings. It is a work that gets better with age, with thought, and with discussion.3) World Experience Because the depictions of class conflict and the allure of the excesses of the rich still resonate after nearly 90 years. The outrageous behavior has parallels and echoes today. The lessons Nick learns are just as valid. Gatsby allows us to experience the world of the ""careless"" and wealthy without becoming its victims.4) Historical Context Because it teaches so much more than a peek at a young gangster's life. Literature such as this is why English and History cannot be separated. You cannot understand Gatsby without understanding the Roaring Twenties, and Gatsby brings the facts and details of that era vividly to life - in all its post-war jubiliation and cynicism, its ostentation and tragedy.5) Education Because not everything we learn in high school is going to stick or agree with us, but it is part of becoming an educated, thinking adult. That may be the only time we are exposed to that idea. It may be the first time we are exposed, and it comes back to develop more fully later. Or it may be an introduction into a style, a person, an event, a history, a field of study that we discover and incorporate into our lives.Note: I don't remember loving this book in High School English, but I didn't dislike it either. It has made more sense in retrospect (even moreso on a long overdue rereading). As I reread it, I wondered how often my high school self fell asleep while reading (since allusions that seemed revelatory in class were blatantly obvious to me this time). I first grew to love it as I taught High School US History and my students' study of it coincided with our study of the 20s. Now it has a place on my favorites list."
2137, ♥,"Great story that reflects the mindset extravagantly centered mindset of the 1920s. The Great Gatsby is filled with melancholy within that takes you in and out of the realistic and idealistic mind, through the character of Nick Carraway. After reading this book, I am still awed by the ungiving mystery that revolves around all of the elements of a story and different ways that it can be interpreted. The most important motive revolves around how poorly trusted and respected the innocent of the time truly were, and the ridiculous extravagance of the society."
2138,Carmyn,"I am not even sure if I truly love this book or if it's just become such a part of my literary heritage that I can't separate myself from it.. much like To Kill a Mockingbird. This is just one of those books I cannot imagine living my life without. Regardless of any movie version released to wider audiences this is one book that plays out in my mind in its own way and no actors (not even Robert Redford) can change that. My Gatsby is different. Not better not worse. Just the Gatsby of my brain, born from the words on the page. This book brings the 1920s to life and makes the history of the era dance the Charleston before my eyes. No, I do... I really do love it."
2139,Tequila Centinela,"En 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald anunció su decisión de escribir ""algo nuevo... algo extraordinario, bello y simple, con un patrón intrincado"". Ese ""algo"" extraordinario, bello, intrincado y, sobre todo simple, se convirtió en una novela: El Gran Gatsby, presumiblemente el mejor trabajo de Fitzgerald y, por supuesto, el libro por el que es mejor conocido.Un retrato de la Era del Jazz en toda su decadencia y exceso, Gatsby captura el espíritu de la generación del autor y se gana un lugar privilegiado y permanente en la mitología estadounidense.Jay Gatsby, un millonario de su propia invención, es la encarnación de algunas de las más profundas obsesiones de Fitzgerald (y, en todo caso, del país en ese momento): dinero, ambición, codicia y la promesa de nuevos comienzos. ""Gatsby creía en la luz verde, el orgiástico futuro que cada año presenta ante nosotros. Se refería a nosotros entonces, pero eso no importa... mañana correremos más rápido, estiraremos nuestros brazos más lejos... Y una mañana..."" La ascensión a la gloria de Gatsby y su eventual caída hace una velada alusión al ya conocido cuento del Sueño Americano.Es también una historia de amor, en cierta forma; se narra la quijotesca pasión de Gatsby por Daisy Buchanan. La pareja se conoce cinco años antes del inicio de la novela, cuando Daisy es una legendaria joven belleza de Louisville y Gatsby un oficinista empobrecido. Ellos se enamoran, pero mientras Gatsby sirve en batalla, Daisy se casa con el brutal y abusivo, pero extremadamente rico Tom Buchanan. Después de la guerra, Gatsby se dedica ciegamente a perseguir la riqueza a cualquier costo... y a perseguir a Daisy, el mismo fin para diferentes caminos.Los eventos se desenvuelven con la inevitable tragedia de un Drama Griego, y es Nick Carraway, el primo de Daisy y vecino de Gatsby quien actúa como un cínico narrador. Con una prosa cristalina y una narrativa elegante, El Gran Gatsby es una lectura tan satisfactoria como el mejor poema."
2140,Vinay Leo R.,"Review @ A Bookworm’s Musing: http://wp.me/p2J8yh-2TD""There are only the pursued, the pursuing; the busy and the tired."" This is but one of the lines in the novel that come to mind when I look back at this wonderful tale. This is just after the plot got interesting. Before that, it seemed to be slow, making me unsure if I can press on with the reading. The Great Gatsby is a tale that shows love in its depth, not overtly shown or explicitly told always, but brought out through small details. It’s too good to put into words, really. It made me wonder why I hadn’t heard of this novel before a friend recommended it to me. Interesting character sketching, matched by a brilliant narration… can’t get better than that!"
2141,katnissbraid.,So perfect. 
2142,Hayden,"Okay, you know what, screw it; screw everything. I actually loved Gatsby. Like, so much. Four stars is not enough for a book I've read five times to the date and loved the hell out of every time; I'm upping it to five stars.Deal with it.***Original ReviewThe Great Gatsby is, i think, the first ""classic"" novel that I've wholeheartedly enjoyed. Something about this story just makes me want to read it over and over again, something unidentifiable.Also, the recent movie adaptation was well done, albeit a bit too long. The soundtrack is fantastic, and Carey Mulligan was an EXCELLENT Daisy, although I was a bit more sympathetic toward her in the film than I was in the book. "
2143,Layne,I'm literally speechless.
2144,Jukka Särkijärvi,"Writing about classics is always tricky. There's this expectation to say something profound about the work, except that since it's a classic, you can be certain that someone else has already said it.The Great Gatsby is not even a particularly tough book. In fact, Fitzgerald's flowing prose and the short length make it pretty much the most accessible Great American Novel out there.Its themes are also very easy to pick out, bordering on the obvious. Of course, the novel does criticize the American Dream several years before the phrase was even coined, and may have been slightly less obvious upon release. Nowadays, when something is described as being about the American Dream, the only open question is how many people die at the end. It's easy going, and the reader can just lean back and let the tale unfold, barrelling onwards like Gatsby's Rolls on the Queensboro Bridge. A more detailed analysis can wait for a reread.In my view, novels like this are the primary justification for the existence of national myths. Artists need something to take the piss out of."
2145,Kar Wai Ng,"""He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was...""-Chapter 6Everyone was in love, and yet no one is in love. That ""thing"" was theme of illusion; the illusion of wealth, of status, of birth, of fantasy, of power, and ultimately of love. All these threads of illusions are woven into the tapestry of this thing called dream. What Gatsby did not notice is that in the pursuit of dreams, that is Daisy, or rather Daisy's love again, the presence of integrity is important as well. Integrity in this context not only refers to morality, but also self-being; Gatsby let the impurity of life eroded his integrity, that is the purity of his dream and love for Daisy, (ironically) in order to achieve the dream. ""You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock,"" Gatsby once remarked to Daisy, but little did he know that the green light was already behind him, ""somewhere in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night."""
2146,Caitlin Constantine,"This book flattened me. I literally felt as though I had been run over by a truck as I read the final pages, and I had to sit quietly for several minutes, with tears running down my face, as I processed what I had just read.I can assure you I had no such reaction when I was a teenager. I don't recall thinking or feeling much at all when I read it back then. Maybe because I didn't quite understand just how sad it all was, and I don't mean sad in the sense that it is a story about a doomed love affair, because the love affair had taken place long before the time frame of the story. What I found terribly sad was the way that Gatsby was living as if it were metaphysically possible to turn back the clock, as if he could, through sheer force of will, make the impossible possible. He was so fixated on this one month he had shared with Daisy, to the exclusion of all else, that when he lost that, he had nothing.And it was more than a little depressing to think Gatsby had lived for five years with a relationship that lasted one month in mind, and that he had built everything around something so ephemeral. I understand being in love, how it can serve as true north for our internal compasses, but at what point does it stop being about love and start being about obsession? Because I got the distinct sense that Gatsby wasn't in love entirely with Daisy but rather what being in love with an upper-class girl like Daisy said about a man of humble beginnings like himself. Something else I noticed was the emphasis placed upon the ages of most of the characters, which seemed to hover around the late 20s and early 30s. As someone who is about a month away from turning 31, I found this particularly striking, because for me, turning 30 has meant leaving behind certain youthful illusions about the world and myself, which is something Nick Carraway and Jay Gatsby both experienced, that loss of belief in your own capacity to make the world into what you want it to be. I don't think it's any mistake that Fitzgerald published this when he was 29. Clearly he was going through something similar.My final observation - not really but I am going to wind this up, simply because I don't want to clog up my friends' email boxes with my musings - is that it occurred to me that Fitzgerald was not glamorizing the time period, which is what I had previously thought. His parties are filled with people who care more about getting drunk and dancing than each other, people who engage in the most mindless, dull conversations, people who are easily star-struck, people for whom their surroundings and their clothes and their music are the most interesting things about them. I don't think Fitzgerald thought too highly of his cohort, because he savages them quite regularly. Odd that this is the case with the book most often held up as the quintessential Jazz Age novel. ------I'm leaving up my previous observations about the book because they still hold true: I'm about halfway through this, and I am in utter adoration of this book. The first time I read it, as a junior in high school, I didn't much care for it. And then I went through a period of time where I read a ton of literary biographies, especially ones about Zelda Fitzgerald, and I came away from them with the view that Scott Fitzgerald was little more than an abusive drunk who cannibalized his wife's talent. Now, though, I'm reading the way the sentences are constructed and the language used to describe otherwise ordinary things, and I realize how wrong I was, on both counts. I imagine I did not care for this as a teenager simply because I had no appreciation for the art and beauty of language and I looked to my books solely for story and plot. Literature and its wonders were lost on me. I also am bringing the perspective of a writer to this, and I now understand how writers take inspiration from the people around them as a matter of course, but it doesn't necessarily mean they are stealing from those people. Fitzgerald may have been inspired by Zelda's beauty and her personality and her style, but unless she wrote the very sentences that ended up in the book, the credit for the writing is entirely his."
2147,Claire O'brien,"I'd read this book years ago but had no real memories of it. I picked it up again to have a look before I went to see the movie, and did not put it down again for over 3 hours. I was totally engaged and found it very witty. The characters are well drawn and the tone of the book is perfect. I would definitely recommend this classic."
2148,Amal,I have finally read The Great Gatsby.. And I finally understand why it is considered one of the greatest novels of its time..
2149,Stormy :),Had to read it again for AP Lang and Comp!!! So good!!!
2150,Victoria,"Man, I truly adore this book. It is a classic love story but surprisingly- it does not have a happy ending. I believe I was supposed to be born in the roaring 20s and its a GUARANTEE i would have married a bootlegger ;) I love the drunken debauchery that occurs at Gatsby's parties! It feels like nothing much has changed from then until now! I think Gatsby fell for the wrong chick, He should have fell for Jordan, as she seems to be more interesting; stronger and amazing. Daisy is an idiot for going back to Tom LOL he is truly a low class filthy degenerate who happens to be rich! Gatsby is truly rich in soul, he is charming, intelligent, witty, brave, courageous... and Thanks to Leonardo DiCaprio, I know he is handsome. :)I am glad I wasn't forced to read this when I was younger. Because as a 30 year old I truly appreciate this story!I had to struggle to read this slow so I can truly enjoy it the first time I read it. I have 2 pages left... that was intentional so today will be the last day reading The Great Gatsby. So I admit, I watched the movie first. Usually when I watch a movie first, I am not inspired to read the book. However, in this case, I could not wait to get into the mind of the narrator and live inside this world of the 20s for a bit. I would love to rent a mansion and have a roaring 20s themed party - with live jazz music and pretend to live a lavish life like Gatsby :):) Well, its time for me to go finish the last 2 pages. I borrowed this from the library, I will now go purchase a copy of the book for my shelves as it is inspiring to read again, and again... that is what makes it a true classic. :)"
2151,Julia Sandler,"This man had such an incredible gift with words, that I found myself marvelling at his talent throughout. It really is a captivating story that takes you to New York circa 1920. This is definitely one of my favourite novels of all time. Luhrmann really does an incredible adaption of this with his film!"
2152,Katie Dreyer ,"Truly, an amazing book. F. Scott Fitzgerald was a literary genius and nobody can convince me otherwise. There are so many quotable passages from the book, his words literally float off the page. Pure, effortless - so beautiful, it'll break your heart, everytime. "
2153,Wsb,One of the BEST books that I have ever read. Nick Carraway moves in next door to the elusive Jay Gatsby. After being invited to one of Gatsby's parties he begins to spend more time with him and finds out the meaning or purpose behind EVERYTHING that Gatsby does. This book kept me on the edge of my seat wanting to know if Gatsby would achieve his goal in the end. The characters were both engaging and annoying at the same time which was GREAT for me. A must read for everyone. 
2154,Gaby,"Hace mucho tiempo que quería leer El Gran Gatsby, y estoy muy feliz de haberlo hecho finalmente. Lo que me atrapó desde la primera página es la prosa tan perfectamente cuidada con que está escrito. Créanme, el Señor Fitzgerald sabía lo que hacía. Él tenía una visión muy clara de la historia y de sus personajes, y creo que quería transmitirlo con precisión. Con esta lectora en particular, logró exactamente eso.Sí, sé que de acuerdo a los estándares actuales su narración abusa de los adjetivos y las analogías, pero considero que la falta es fácilmente perdonada. A pesar de ser en esencia una historia frívola de gente millonaria que puede llegar a resultar muy poco agradable, está hermosamente narrada. ¿Y qué puedo decir de Gatsby? Es un personaje que creo nunca voy a entender por completo; ni siquiera sé con seguridad si me cae bien. Supongo que siento mucha pena por él... es la personificación de la contradicción existencial de tenerlo todo y no tener nada en lo absoluto. Este es un libro que, para mí, no tiene desperdicio. Tiene cientos de citas notables, de las cuales sólo voy a nombrar unas pocas:
Cuando era más joven y más vulnerable, mi padre me dio un consejo del que no he dejado de dar vueltas desde entonces. ""Siempre que sientas deseos de criticar a alguien"", me dijo, ""recuerda que no todo el mundo ha disfrutado de las facilidades que tú has tenido"". [...] El resultado es que tiendo a no juzgar a nadie, costumbre que me ha hecho relacionarme con muchas personas interesantes y me ha convertido también en víctima de bastantes pelmazos inveterados.

Todos nos sospechamos poseedores de por lo menos una de las virtudes cardinales; en mi caso, creo ser una de las pocas personas honestas que conozco.

No existe fuego ni lozanía capaz de competir con lo que un hombre atesora en el fantasmagórico mundo de su corazón.

Tom y Daisy eran criaturas desconsideradas: hacían añicos cosas y personas y luego volvían a su dinero o a su enorme desconsideración, o lo que fuese que les mantenía unidos, y dejaban que otros se encargaran de limpiar lo que ellos habían ensuciado...
Y, finalmente, mi cita favorita de todo este libro es, en efecto, su último párrafo:
Y así seguimos adelante, botes contra la corriente, empujados incesantemente hacia el pasado.

2155,Anne Nikoline,"""The Great Gatsby"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald is much more than a simple love story about a man and a woman going through some trubles in order to be reunited at last. It is a large mosaic made of symbolism and visual pictures made from a devouring writing. It is a story of a man trying to capture the past in his presents, where green and gold money colours his everyday. He is a man very few truly knows and the more the narrator, Nick Carraway, and the reader get to know him, the more the sympathy for him grows as he is on a fairly impossible mission. “And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.”When I first read ""The Great Gatsby"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald a few years ago I was sceptical because I did not truly care for its symbolism which hangs over the novel as a shining sun. I recently read it again with a different understand of its concept, and just a week later I decided to reread it once more just before the film is released with Leonardo DiCaprio, Carey Mulligan and Tobey Maguire in the leads. “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”With a much different understand of the context, Fitzgerald's authorship and the symbolism of the novel, I can honestly say that it has not only a special place in my heart, but also among my all time favourite books. The story is elegant and written enduring. I cannot put a finger on any aspect of the novel that did not make the reading a honest pleasure. "
2156,NancyHelen,"Up until today, I might have been the only person in the world who hadn't read Gatsby. But now I have, I do feel that my life is just that little bit better. The subtlety and sadness of this book is something I really hadn't expected. Fortunately, I didn't know the story before I read it so the whole thing, especially the ending, was a surprise. The writing is sublime, with just the right mix of dialogue, metaphor and stream of consciousness. The introduction in this edition is extensive and very detailed and definitely deserves a second or third reading, as does the book. For a short novel, this packs so much. I could easily have reached the last page and turned back to start all over again."
2157,Noemie,"I had to come back and rewrite my review since the book as now grown on me. I started thinking about it and the symbols in it. And not about how shallow the characters seemed to be, but how meaningful the book was. I was annoyed with Gatsby's ''Old Sport'' expression, but now, I kind of miss it and I like it. I fell in love with F.Scott Fitzgerald's writing style.Previous review:I felt like I didn't know much about the characters even after a reading the whole book. There wasn't much of a physical description and even on a psychological level, I only knew that Tom was an asshole and Gatsby was obsessed with Daisy and the expression ''Old sport''. I did like Nick, he seemed like the only sane person in this book. I felt like there wasn't much to the story line, though. There was one but it didn't feel very present.. Everything just happened in the last 2 chapters, the ones before that where just about describing towns and cars and yellow things and using the word ''gay'' and ''gaiety'' too many times. I did love the writing style though, and it was a very easy read. I would recommend reading it at least once in your lifetime."
2158,Baylee,"Questo è un romanzo su un sogno che chiunque abbia vissuto abbastanza da ""sapere come va il mondo"" definirebbe assurdo. Folle. Fanciullesco. Qualunque persona di questo tipo avrebbe dissuaso un amico dal credere in quel sogno.Eppure è difficile resistere al fascino di questo sogno. Perché? Perché ha la forza dei sogni dell'adolescenza, quando si è invincibili di fronte al mondo. Quando si ha la forza e l'indeterminatezza di essere qualunque cosa. E qual è questo sogno? Cosa vuole Jay Gatsby? Egli vuole sposare la donna che ama, Daisy, e per farlo lui, povero soldato di umili origini, deve rendersi degno di lei agli occhi del mondo. Come? Diventando ricco, ma così ricco da non poter essere ignorato.Ebbene, Gatsby ci riesce. Ma Daisy, desiderosa di mantenere costante il suo livello di benessere, si è già sposata con il rampollo di una ricca famiglia, Tom Buchanan. Ricco quanto rozzo, Tom condivide con molti - forse tutti - dei suoi pari la convinzione che gli arricchiti siano feccia inferiore, incapaci della loro specchiata moralità.Ma la moralità di Tom non emerge mai dal romanzo. Mai. Tom, come Daisy d'altro canto, è terribilmente superficiale. Essere da sempre stati abituati a schioccare le dita e ad ottenere quello che volevano li ha resi incapaci di dare il giusto valore a cose e persone.E questo abisso tra il sogno di Gatsby e la superficialità di Daisy annienterà il primo e salverà la seconda. E l'ordine - sbagliato, corrotto, ma pur sempre ordine - del mondo sarà preservato. Gatsby sapeva che il denaro non ha valore. E' ciò che possiamo comprare con il denaro a possedere il valore. E questo Daisy, donna in cerca di stabilità, e Tom, uomo fiero delle sue origini, non l'hanno mai capito."
2159,Gabi,"Gabi MoberlyA2 English 232The Great Gatsby The author’s purpose of writing The Great Gatsby is to entertain readers with a story about how unfulfilling the life a a rich man actually is. F. Scott Fitzgerald, the author, tells the story of a very wealthy man named Jay Gatsby through the narrator and Gatsby’s only friend, Nick Carraway. Gatsby has lavish parties in which hundreds of people attend every weekend, all weekend; but he does not know any of the guests who walk through his door. Fitzgerald uses Gatsby’s story to prove that a life filled with money and parties and riches does not make people happy. This book was written in the 1920’s, a time of riches for the majority of Americans, and Fitzgerald is sick of the empty, facetious, rich people who surround him. Fitzgerald wants his readers to understand that there is more to life than having large amounts of money. He wants people to realize that being rich does not make you happy or give you a fulfilling life.  The theme of The Great Gatsby is the hollowness of the upper class. The author wants to show his readers that living lavish lifestyles with rich and famous people is not fulfilling in any way. Gatsby for instance, has an enormous mansion, drives a Rolls-Royce, and has outrageous parties every weekend. The story encompasses that while Gatsby has these huge parties, and lots of money, and lots of fans; he is always looking for something more. His money cannot make him happy the way the love of his life does, or his new friend Nick does. Gatsby thinks that having all this money and material items will make his love come back to him, simply because he is richer than her current husband. Jay Gatsby begins to come in contact with the fake, hollow people that come along with the rich life. Fitzgerald says “You see I usually find myself around strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad things that happened to me.” The upper class all live a rich neighborhood called the East Egg; they are selfish, arrogant, empty people… except for Gatsby, who lives in the West Egg. He gets to know all of these empty people with empty lives and realizes that a life like that is not what he wants. The Great Gatsby is written in narrative style. The author shows this through a story told by events that happen in chronological order. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby as a narrative story because it is the most common and most well liked way of writing. The more people enjoy the style of writing, the more people want to read it. Narrative style is easy to understand because it is similar to listening to a story as if someone were telling that story. The Great Gatsby is also told in first person, as if the character is telling the reader the story personally. An example of first person narrative writing is when Fitzgerald says “In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.” This tells the readers about an event from the character’s past as if the character were talking directly to the reader.The Great Gatsby is one of the best books I have ever read. It is so symbolic and interesting to read. I enjoyed reading this novel and I think everyone old enough to comprehend it will too. I generally do not like classic novels because I cannot understand them, but The Great Gatsby was comprehensible and enjoyable. I highly recommend this book to other teen and adult readers. It is no wonder why The Great Gatsby is one of the most famous classic novels in the world. It is a wonderful novel, like nothing I have ever read before. The only thing I would change about this book is the sad details. Over all it is a great book with little flaws. I give The Great Gatsby 5 out of 5 stars."
2160,Kruizzer Alvarez,"Haven't read that much classics, but this is my favourite so far. (y)Loved the film adaptation with Leo Dicaprio!!"
2161,Redbaerd,"I returned to this novel after a Hemmingway binge and Fitzgerald was a perfect antidote to the muscular distant prose of his contemporary. The world feels lit-up, bleary-eyed, streaming momentum, and precariously reposed while I read this book (and Tender is the Night), and it makes me regretful and glad that I live in this world."
2162,Noel Wallace,"Wow. Just wow. I literally just finished reading this book, and I'm not even sure what to say. Let me just say that this book was definitely one of the best books ever written. The underlying themes about excess, debauchery, materialism, and social class were so prominent and so eye-opening. I thought I knew most everything I could know about the 20s until I read this book. I learned so much that saddened me but made me understand more about the time period. The themes that are mentioned are so important in this book and make it a really good read. Of course we also have the characters in the book. I loved every single one of the characters in this book. Rarely is there a book where I love all the characters, but I loved them all. Each one of them had so much character development that is a treat to follow along with. I especially loved reading about the progression of Nick's relationship with Gatsby. I loved watching them go from neighbors all the way to (view spoiler)[ Nick attending Gatsby's funeral.  (hide spoiler)] I loved learning about the history between Daisy and Gatsby and I loved watching Gatsby (view spoiler)[ try to win Daisy back.  (hide spoiler)] Frankly, I was glad Daisy (view spoiler)[ stayed with Tom  (hide spoiler)] but I liked watching (view spoiler)[ Gatsby's progress.  (hide spoiler)]Overall, such a good book. Amazing characters, amazing story line, amazing underlying themes, amazing symbolism, just such a good book. I could probably rave about this book forever because it was so good. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good book to read, especially if you are an historical fiction person like I am. "
2163,Stephen Joanes,"F. Scott Fitzgerald does so much in such a small novel. He builds mystery, studies character and critiques American values all within 200 pages. Gatsby himself is a marvelous character, seriously flawed yet incredibly enchanting. Fitzgerald builds and destroys his character strategically and in may ways, poetically. Nick Carraway is the memorable narrator, and through him Fitzgerald utilizes his stunning vocabulary ... always seeming to find the right words to describe both the orthodox and unorthodox. "
2164,Cade,"The Great Gatsby is considered to be one of the most famous classics in American literature and it is understandable why. There are certain aspects in the book that the reader takes away and it is hard to imagine that a reader would ever forget them. I personally took away the common idea that someone doesn't truly want something until someone else wants it as well, and wealth and parties does not create happiness, it's the people at the parties that do. Also, there are things from our pasts that hold us back and it is necessary for us to let them go or it could be the end of us."
2165,Evelynmariagonzalez Spivey,"The Great Gatsby is one of the greatest stories ever told. The character of the impractical Jay Gatsby and his love for the unattainable Daisy will bring you to tears! In terms of story structure and character development, this is a classic. Read this book and learn the principles of superior fiction writing. "
2166,Frances Ann,"YES YES YES YES!!!!! I loved this book!!! I have a wierd obsession with symbolism in books, and this book is full of people, places and things that you can interpret. I really like the sign of Dr. Eckleberg watching over the Valley of Ashes, for example. It can be interpreted in other ways, but I like to think that it the sign represents a weakened God in the age of industry and science watching over a desolate world of transient, grey figures, the inhabitants of what what once was the garden of Eden. It's a very powerful metaphor.  This is not a happy book, certainly. It can actually get very upsetting towards the end when Gatsby dies and practically no one wants to go to his funeral, but it is still very powerful. Fitzgerald is a gifted writer, and every word he uses counts to illustrate this story of wealth, romance, and corruption. "
2167,Maria,"This was a great and inspirational read. I had a hard time with the preview/prologue at the beginning of the book (not sure how it's called), but after that I was just sucked in (and almost missed my stop when sitting in the train once and had to push my way through an angry crowd at rush time, oh - the horrors I had to live through because of this book!).The descriptions are mind-blowing and the comparisons the writer makes are something I, as a sort-of writer, strive to achieve. You get to know the characters pretty well, except for the leading character (the 'I' in the book) Nick. He observes the situations before him without judging, as stated in the preview/prologue, which gives you the chance to form your own opinion. It works perfectly in The Great Gatsby, because some scenes ask to be played out without the narrator forcing his/her opinion down your throat. Also, because the scenes that do play out are not necessarily about him, so maybe his opinion doesn't really matter and it also doesn't really matter what his favorite colour is. I could go on about how F. Scott Fitzgerald gave me some things to think about, how some descriptions of scenery will stick with me and will enhance my perception of them. I will definitely read it again to notice all the small details I missed the first time because I was tired or because the battery of my phone almost died and I had to hurry to get to the next chapter."
2168,Bevin lost in Wonderland,"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.Do you ever read a book that has such an impact on you, that you don't know what to think? Thank you, F. Scott Fitzgerald, for giving me that experience with The Great Gatsby. "
2169,Ian Reutelhuber,"Loved the book, but who doesn't.. I did have a few quick thoughts. The first is that I wasn't a huge fan of the ending. I realize it must flow and maybe I'm just a sucker for the cliche happy endings, but I loved the first three quarters of the book so much more than the latter part. Chasing your dreams, albeit ones formed in the past, is a noble ambition, not something that leads to your demise. Alternate endings, anyone?Secondly, The Great Gatsby is undoubtedly a classic, but is it really head and heels better than Fitzgerald's other novels? I'm not so sure. And lastly, it's just comical to me how little I cared for the book in school when it was ""required reading"" compared to how much I enjoyed it now. Oh, high school. "
2170,André Shart,"Não vou estender-me muito a fazer esta crítica nem falar sobre o livro em si, já que existem muitas outras que podem encontrar para esse efeito. Quero só dizer que me apetece deitar no chão e chorar agarrado a ele. Não tenho mais palavras."
2171,Ahmed S. Darwish,"""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter — tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning — So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.""This was possibly the only novel that I've read twice: its English prose is so concise, so beautiful, so symbolic, and so dreamy that it really puts you in a good, movie-like, mode.And beside the beautiful prose, there are fresh colors everywhere: Daisy's ""golden"" hair and ""silver""-ish cloth, Gatsby's pink suits, the green light and the blue one, the yellow car, the green tickets, the gold-hatted lovers, windows with reflected sunshine gold, the foamy pink and golden clouds, and it just goes on and on.I won't tell you it's a classic ""must read"", you'll have to judge that by yourself. Just enjoy the quoted prose below:Daisy's voice: ""It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered 'Listen,' a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.""Jordan's face: ""The last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened — then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.""The cat: ""The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and turning my head to watch it ... fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbor’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars ... it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.""Gatsby's party: ""The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher... The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.""Gatsby's smile and obsession with winning people over: ""It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across 4 or 5 times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.""Great bridge: ""Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of non-olfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.""Daisy: ""'Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?' The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone, before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.""The window scene: ""The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea. 'Look at that,' she whispered, and then after a moment: 'I’d like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around.'""The rich and the poor: ""All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on the air' One thing’s sure and nothing’s surer. The rich get richer and the poor get— children In the meantime, in between time—”That beautiful voice: ""Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again. When the melody rose, her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.""The golden girl: ""'Her voice is full of money,' he said, suddenly. That was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of money—that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals' song of it... high in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl...""The rich and the poor, again: ""She had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.""And finally, on getting older: ""I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a new decade. Thirty— the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning brief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside me, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age."""
2172,Thomas Wilson,"The Great Gatsby By F. Scott FitzgeraldLet me start with I would have never read this if not for my daughter. She read it in college and insisted that I read it. While out to lunch with her I asked her if she had read my first book yet, when she rebutted with “Have you read the Great Gatsby yet?”After lunch we by a second hand book store, where my daughter produced a used copy of this book. After a couple of moments inspection it bothered me that a very used copy of his book was going to cost me $7.99 and my newest novel was hardly selling at $4.99 as an E-book. That coupled with the fact this book was originally published in 1925, making it 86 years old and used and abused it still commanded more than my newest creation. I had never heard of F. Scott Fitzgerald before picking this book up, and would not have read it if not for doing so in order to get my daughter to read my first book.So going into it with a completely open and unbiased frame of mind and not knowing what to expect, I was blown away right from the start. I even did a blog post about the way he describes Gatsby’s smile when he is first introduced in the book.I was further encouraged as a beginning author to read at the end of the book how the first reviews of the book were not very good, the sales were a disappointment, the book was strongly edited and re-edited in later subsequent editions and the book didn’t really explode as a piece of masterpiece literature until the 1950’s, years after Mr. Fitzgerald had died. I do pray my books provide some even mediocre sustenance to my existence while I am living. I actually hope to one day be able to write full time while living at home helping take care of my boys. But reading a definite masterpiece of American Literature, and reading about the inconsistencies and errors of Fitzgerald’s writing only inspires me more as an aspiring author.They off way in which he describes things, the depth and complexity of the characters, the picture perfect way he describes the life and times of the early twenties, and the strength of the story itself all lend to a highly entertaining and enjoyable must read. He isn’t perfect, neither are his characters, as we as readers aren’t perfect in our everyday lives. The immorality of the twenties reads as if you were reading about the people and private events of those all around us. The reporting of news and the way things actually happened could make The Great Gatsby just as relevant story in 2011, as it was in the early twenties.This will be the first book I give a five star rating!"

2174,Alec Glazier,"Yes, this book was something new, extrordinary, and simple, just like what the back of the book said. In fact, the back of the book was the biggest factor that hooked me into reading this masterpiece. F. Scott Fitzgerald quite outdid himself with this book to be considered Great American Literature, along with some of the most interesting, challenging, and creative books that have been written by some of the most published and intelligent authors in history. Fun yet challenging, I thought that there was a great intensity of vocabulary. In fact there was so much that I had to look up about twenty words in the dictionary. Learning new words was a great experience, and especially that I can now know what people are saying when they use these words, but I can also manipulate them. There was a great cliffhanger at the end of the first chapter, when Nick sees the green light from Daisy's dock. It was the main component in the book that encouraged me to continue on. There was so much description in the book, that I could understand the book well. The imagery in the book was fantastic, especially in Chapter IX when Nick runs into Tom at the jewelry shop, who is Daisy's so I call ""ex-husband"" on the street. I actually felt bad for Tom though when Daisy finally confesses that she loves Gastby at the dance party, when they are in their 20's and 30's. Although I was able to understand the book well, it just didn't seem exactly right that the book should be called The Great Gatsby, because Jay Gastby isn't the person who is being focused on the most, even though Nick talks about Gatsby's death at the end. It was definitely fun to read when Gatsby had his parties, and Nick says that he is one of the few people who is actually invited to the parties. He says that most people just come by inviting themselves, which is interesting because it seems that people would have polite manners back in the Jazz Age. One confusing part in the book is when Wilson loses is wife in the taxi cab. I didn't quite understand the relationship between Gatsby's friends to Michaelis and Wilson. I was expecting a little bit of humor, although I don't prefer it, to be in the book since it is much more modern than the rest of the classics that I have read. It actually was the first classic book that I read that uses some phonetic words to express how the characters were saying a word, like ""Oggsford"" instead of ""Oxford."" This seemed to be somewhat less practical, but much more expressive. It actually helped me understand the personalities of the character, showing where their particular way of language use comes from. Overall, this book is a fun, challenging, exciting, and mature book to read."
2175,Kris - My Novelesque Life,"4.5 STARS""The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s third book, stands as the supreme achievement of his career. This exemplary novel of the Jazz Age has been acclaimed by generations of readers. The story of the fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his love for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan, of lavish parties on Long Island at a time when The New York Times noted “gin was the national drink and sex the national obsession,” it is an exquisitely crafted tale of America in the 1920s."" (From Amazon) A tragic love story set in the Jazz Age. "
2176,Ashley Aust,"I would rate The Great Gatsby 4.5 out of 5 stars. To explain:To begin with, I like to say even though I basically hated everyone in the book it's still one of my favorites, why? Well Gatsby of course. When I read this book for my A.P Literature class I didn't think I was going to like it at all, mainly because up until this year I've hated classics. I think that The Great Gatsby was a turning point for me. The characters in the book brought out such strong emotions to and that why I think Fitzgerald is so amazing because he made me so emotional about a book I came into thinking I'd hate. I feel in love with the tragic tell of Gatsby and it made me want to read more classic surprisingly. And if it were for the reasons above only it would be a perfect score, sadly Fitzgerald did one thing I for personally ticked me off. What may that be? WARNING NEXT SENTENCE MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. He killed of my favorite character! Now the ending was beautiful and the best it could be to keep true to the story but come on, I am so sick of watching the fictional characters I love die."
2177,Jonathan,"My essay on The Great Gatsby and reification
Why do I love The Great Gatsby?
A lot of people would likely agree with me when I say that F.Scott Fitzgerald's writing here leaves only a little to be desired. The characters themselves seem shallow and empty, lacking in morality and you could take all this into consideration and instantly go: 'well that's a shallow book if ever I've heard of one.' But in my eyes, The Great Gatsby is a scathing social commentary that explores the fruitlessness of pursuing dreams that in reality are nothing more than shadows. To that end The Great Gatsby is a brilliant piece of fiction designed to criticise the lack of morality of the rich and selfish individuals who feed off the work of the poor. One of me favourite parts in this novel is the depiction of the Valley of Ashes, which ultimately all the characters seem to pass through in the novel whether they are rich or poor. It is a place of equality and reminds me of the idea of the 'Valley of the Shadow of Death' mentioned by the Psalmist, and in the novel itself Wilson relates those giant eyes to the eyes of God, a God who sees all that men do. To me that is such a brilliant image to present to the reader. It is imagery like this that haunts me from this novel and that I remember emphatically.It is also the language of Fitzgerald's work that draws me in. It may not always be flawless writing but it is vivid and alive, thoughtful writing. It is the language of quotes such as the very opening lines that keep me enthralled by this book:“In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.‘Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,’ he told me, ‘just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.’”Of course The Great Gatsby will always be a polarising text due to its characters and the debate about whether it's really a novel about the American Dream. Is this polarising effect something that perhaps stems from the allure of the book - the way in which the novel hauntingly hints at something greater while remaining so brilliantly flawed? I certainly cannot fully explain my own fascination with the book, save that it does that rare thing that strong literature should do. It should be, as Kafka said, the axe for the frozen sea within us. And for me, that is what this novel is.
'To Dream, to Sleep'
It is often said that The Great Gatsby is purely about the failings of The American Dream. This dream being the idea that any man, woman or child in America regardless of race or upbringing should have the opportunity to reach their fullest potential and better themselves if they work hard and play by the rules. In The Great Gatsby the way in which Gatsby himself becomes the near legendary and wealthy figure of Gatsby mimics the idea of how anyone can attain power and a legacy in American society. (view spoiler)[Of course, he attains this wealth by possibly illegitimate means, therefore making a mockery of this dream in some regards, not to mention the very ending of the novel (in which his funeral is attended by a mere handful of individuals) in itself mocks this idea. (hide spoiler)] However, to consider The Great Gatsby as merely a tale about The American Dream misses the point entirely. This is a novel that more seeks to depict a particular era of history and therefore preserve it and as a result features the failed American Dream as a central theme. The marvel of Fitzgerald's work is not in the prose itself, which is in itself marvellously poetic and a touch melodramatic (thereby adding to the sense of the era), but in the descriptions and what the prose hints at. Fitzgerald's writing in this book is as much about what he does not say as as much what he says. His narrator, Nick Carraway, is often described as the perfect example of the reliable narrator because there is no sense that anything is being hidden and yet despite using a reliable narrator Fitzgerald is able to weave language so that by omitting certain descriptions he leaves behind a haunting idea that allows the reader to fill in the gaps themselves as he directs. Think of it as like a painting where the artist has placed red and white close together to give the illusion of a pink blend being formed. This is what Fitzgerald does with his language. The characters of this novel are in my view, perfect literary creations. They are not characters I would ever want to befriend but they are, in their own particular way, uniquely lifelike. Their dialogue (again, through the way words and ideas are left hanging cleverly by Fitzgerald) grants the illusion that the reader is observing a transcript of real individuals (and it may have been noted elsewhere that Fitzgerald did base some of the characters on real individuals he knew, however do not quote this as truth). Among the characters feature: Nick (the sole likeable character and the narrator), Daisy, Tom, Gatsby, Jordan Baker and Meyer Wolfsheim, all of whom are fascinating characters. It is interesting that The Great Gatsby has recently been filmed again, and from appearances, filmed as a lavish spectacle of a film. In many regards this ironically misses the entire point of the novel and at the same time serves the novel very well as a vehicle of its themes. In the way that Gatsby himself throws wild luxurious parties, so the film is in itself a vehicle of the spectacular sense of wastefulness inherent in the novel. It is this hedonism, this wastefulness, that I perceive as the real underlying theme of the novel. The American Dream, to my eyes, is a mere side affect of the core idea Fitzgerald attempts to reconcile the reader with - the idea of flawed humanity. Why else would all Fitzgerald's characters be tainted with such particular flaws? Nick himself notes that he believes his flaw to be grounded in honesty, Jordan Baker's is found in dishonesty, Gatsby's flaws are in his profound naivety, Meyer Wolfsheim's flaws are in his sense of indestructible invincibility, Daisy possesses the flaw of being superficial and Tom possesses a narcissistic and supercilious streak to his persona.""I couldn't forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back to their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made...""What readers should see then is that The Great Gatsby is more than the novel of The American Dream. It is a novel about flawed ordinary human beings when you break them down and examine them. It is a novel that explores how ultimately equality can be seen in how all men must die and how all men will pay for their crimes or selfishness, perhaps not immediately but in the future. It is a novel about many things because it is a novel that does not limit itself to being one thing alone. It is a masterpiece, flawed in every way and perfect in so many ways.“Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther… . And then one fine morning—So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”These are some of the most potent words to end any novel. They highlight the sense given by other quotes (""'Can't repeat the past,' he cried incredulously. 'Why of course you can!'"") that time eventually catches up to all individuals and that humanity is bound to repeat various cycles or stages of its own history. In this regard perhaps The Great Gatsby could be seen as a pessimist's novel, a novel about the fruitlessness of human endeavour. Yet, to read it as such is to miss the sense of optimism Fitzgerald provides. Yes, he states, yes we do keep trying to push forward into the future believing in our dreams and in those unobtainable ideals. Yes, we do keep falling back into the past, a past we cannot, as Nick states, repeat. A past we cannot repeat and profit from. Our aim, Fitzgerald seems to urge, must be to learn from the past and to not let the current of history sweep us back into old cycles of life.“You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didn’t I? I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.”In many ways the dream of The Great Gatsby is that humanity can learn to wake from dreaming. That humanity can stop being careless and fixated on the unobtainable. Gatsby's dream, Nick notes, ""was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city."" For Gatsby, in seeking to move onward and to go back to what he once had he forgot what truly lay behind and therefore failed. Because he himself had become one of those many reckless individuals in how he tried to reach his dream. The Great Gatsby seems to be a keen warning and perhaps it is for this reason that it remains a polarising novel. It is the sheer mystery of it all as we go on reading and learning..."

2179,Mike,"On Newbury Street in Boston, there’s a tourist trap named Daisy Buchanan’s. Newbies to Boston see it, equate its location to the establishment’s prestige, and based on a reputation projected on Newbury Street itself, the poor sap spends $7 on bottled Corona; in short, a fool enticed to over-spending on a bottle of piss. How perfect is the name for that bar, then?Fitzgerald’s Really Good American Novella gets mileage out of disappointment and expectation. It uses symbols, from genius (the Doctor’s eyes) to come-on-now (the weather) to remind us that things possess no intrinsic value, but represent things in a self-made narrative. Welcome to AP English, folks: Gatsby projects a fiction onto Daisy Buchanan (Green Light anyone?), a Boston n00b projects onto Daisy Buchanan’s, and a naïf like me projects onto The Great Gatsby. The hype and allure instilled an excited fantasy, but what it is falls a little short of what I wanted, and the dream is crushed.I have problems with Gatsby. (Spoilers ahead) The first: it relegates the intrigue, back-handed business, and war into the background. Why? To dwell on an irritating love triangle and a climax (NOT the ending, mind) that borders on the operatic. More compelling elements of Jay Gatsby are anecdotal in nature; did all the idealizing of the American Dream need to be funneled into helpless love and shouldered by Daisy Buchanan?Fitzgerald must stay within Carraway’s experience, but Carraway still rounds up an impressive amount of information, especially about Wilson. Also Daisy is Gatsby’s Rosebud, only Rosebud isn’t a vapid twat. The second: the mid-section drags. The third: the book relies on the peculiar involvement of a minor insane character, and it makes Fitzgerald’s argument less convincing in its realism. The fourth: it’s hard to believe that Carraway’s escape from America’s hapless materialism is to…wait for it…move to the Midwest. Really? Is moving farther in really the best cure-all there, kiddo?So why 5 stars? Well, these are minor objections, and I see the refutations to them. The ending is spectacular, the style superb, and the book is so elegantly constructed. I admit my immediate reaction was of amazement…to the last chapter, at least. The Great Gatsby is a really good American novella; Chapter 9, though, has got to be the Greatest American Chapter. For that, for its irresistible portrayal of horrible rich people, for its memorability and thematic mastery, I have to not be a jerk and just go for it.And even if I followed the book down the path of hype to find disappointment, the book would only demonstrate one of its points. How cool is that?"
2180,Rahil Zabihi,"Currently writing book reviews is not easy for me. But Great Gatsby cannot be left un-reviewed. I think the Art of Fitzgerald is in his meticulous observation of characters and reaching their cores. He seemed to know people rather too well, a kind of modern, male, American Jane Austen. When he writes about the feelings, emotions and their complexity, the complexity of human consciousness is actually revealed. Gatsby is a compact profound novel of characters. Though in the surface it may seem otherwise and Fitzgerald is a great storyteller. And here is how the book ends and I write it down here since it is considerably impressive:Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eludes us then, but that's no matter- tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arm farther... And one fine morning-So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."
2181,Betsy,"Read this first in high school, and after finishing it as an adult, I feel more strongly than ever that these sorts of classic stories are wasted when we read them as teenagers. What a sad, sad book. And Gatsby is just a sad, sad, mixed-up, man. The whole roaring 20s scene Fitzgerald writes about at Gatsby's parties reminded me of the hot mess America gets a front seat to with things like the  The Jersey Shore  and other positively awful reality TV shows where the viewer can hardly believe that the people on camera all belong to the human race half of the time. It made me feel slightly better/worse about humanity and its' present state that as long as there has been the ability for excess that people are keen to make fools of themselves without inhibition. Another thing I failed to grasp in high school is that I didn't remember Daisy being so  awful  from my original read. I sort of wanted to throttle her, particularly when we reach the horrible climax and everything goes spiraling down into one big giant disastrous mess. A mess which, I really wanted to lay entirely at her spoiled, rich ridiculous feet. At the very least I was as disgusted as Nick with the whole of the New York social scene and Daisy in particularly by the time the book ended. It's quite a read though. Reading this, and trying to write stories myself, I'm reminded why I should spend more time reading great works of literature. Fitzgerald does so much in such a short span of time there's a reason it's a classic."
2182,David Horten,"I thought this book was amazing. This book had many of the things I find interesting. It had a combination of history and amazing storytelling. The history from this book is from the roaring twenties. This period was after the war and many people got rich from the stock market.It told a story of a man who was poor in his early years and rose up with a dream to become rich. This man was Gatsby. He is talked about a lot by tons of people. Many people like him for his parties. Gatsby makes up stories about himself in order to become this mystery rich man. One of the main characters is Nick Carraway. He lives next door to Gatsby in a small but average house. Carraway is a bond seller, who went to Yale. This is were he knows Tom. Tom is married to Nick's cousin Daisy. Later in the story there is a Gatsby and Daisy love connection. Before this Nick finally gets invited to one of Gatsby's parties. This is where he meets Gatsby with another character named Jordan. You later learn that Gatsby throws parties to express Daisy who he cherishes ever since before the war. Tom grows suspicious of the relationship between Daisy and Gatsby. Daisy says that they should go to the city and everyone agrees. Then they all go to a hotel in the city were Tom confronts Gatsby. (view spoiler)[ Tom talks about the bad things Gatsby did to get rich. This is were Daisy realizes that Tom is better for her.(view spoiler)[(view spoiler)[ They all leave and go through a valley where the person who Tom was having an affair with got hit by a car.

As the book ends it shows Nick in Gatsby's house for the funeral but only a few people showed, one being Gatsby's dad.(view spoiler)[ (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)] (hide spoiler)]"
2183,Suad Shamma,"I don't think I am capable of putting to words what I thought of this novel.The Great Gatsby is a jazzy tale that takes place in 1920's America and revolves around seven characters: Jay Gatsby, impeccable host with a past unknown to many, in love with naive, superficial and materialistic Daisy Buchanan. Daisy, in turn, married herself to Tom Buchanan for the sole purpose of continuing to lead a life of privilege. Tom is an egotistic, adulterer, whose latest mistress is none other than the mechanic's wife, Myrtle Wilson. The mechanic, George Wilson, is good friends with Tom, and is none the wiser about this affair. Jordan Baker, a golfer and Daisy's friend, is aware of everything that's happening, and brings in narrator, and neighbour of Gatsby, Nick Carraway into the picture.In a strange turn of events, Nick becomes a close friend and confidante of Gatsby. Gatsby is now a very wealthy man who lives in a mansion and holds daily parties that go on until the early hours of the morning, in the hopes that one day, Daisy would walk in through the doors. With Nick's help, Daisy and Jay meet again, and the romance is instantly rekindled. However, in The Great Gatsby, it isn't a matter of all's well that ends well.This story really makes me sad. A very charming man, Jay Gatsby wanted nothing more in this world than to be with Daisy. Daisy on the other hand is torn between wanting love, and wanting to remain with Tom and her comfortable existence. I wasn't very surprised with the ending, as I saw it coming. But I was surprised at the reaction of all the people that surrounded Gatsby, and angry at quite a few of them.Definitely a must-read. A classic by all means, a timeless tragic tale that has and always will capture the hearts of readers. "
2184,Ray Irving,"I listened to an audio book version brilliantly narrated by Jake Gyllenhal - perfectly cast. This novel is superbly well crafted and has a well deserved place in the list of great American Classics. The descriptions always ""pop"" in a way that makes the recent film by Baz Luhrman seem less Over the top. Visualization flows convincingly into the minds eye and always one feels like one really is in 1920's New York, from the sumptuous mansions and parties to the desolate grey of the ashes. The narrator (and main character) is sympathetic and draws you into his point of view as the story unfolds. . The story is tragic and tells of how Mr. Gatsby comes to town and proceeds to make quite an impression in order to attract the attention of Daisy, a love from his youth who is now married and, by chance, cousin to the narrator who has also, by chance, moved in next door to Gatsby. So it transpires that Gatsby is brought down by his unrequited love for the woman (or maybe she does love him but is held back by the gravitational pull of her marriage and motherhood - after all, where was he when she _was_ waiting for him?). It then also becomes apparent that Gatsby was only driven to make something of himself in order to be worthy of Daisy. So the tragic irony is complete - Gatsby was orbiting her all along but his ""sun"" was unaware and unconscious of her effect on him. It's a great read and would be really interesting to do in depth, for example as a novel at school."
2185,Kayla,"This is my second time reading this book, and I had an even better experience this time around. I read it the first time my junior year of high school, and although I really enjoyed it, my enjoyment of it was lessened by the fact that it was required reading. But since the movie came out this month I decided to re-read it in preparation.This novel is a great piece of literature. There were so many things that I missed the first time around that I picked up on and because I read it for my own personal reasons, I really got a chance to connect with the novel.The Great Gatsby is a very nice commentary on the party days of the roaring twenties and they way people spent their days living it up and disregarding their responsibilities. It also seemed to comment on the idea that money can't buy everything. These characters are often criticized for being one-dimensional, but I feel like Fitzgerald did this for a reason. They seem to have it all, and yet not one of the characters are actually happy. They also all want things they can't have, and seem to be searching for that piece they are missing. Gatsby of course has longed for Daisy for years, and she is somebody he knows he can't have. Although Tom has it all, he has an extra marital affair with Myrtle and in return Myrtle is cheating on Wilson with Tom.The narrator Nick doesn't seem to fit this mold as much, but he to is empty. Spending his times on the sideline, watching everybody else's life and not really living his own.Fitzgeralds writing is incredible, and beautiful. He flawlessly paints a picture with his words, and some of the imagery is truly lovely. There are great quotes in here. The plot is also wonderful.Overall I love this book, and it is probably my second favorite classic next to A Separate Peace by John Knowles, unless you consider The Outsiders a classic, in which case it gets pushed down to my number three spot :) Though I don't think it's for everyone because people seem to either love it or hate it."
2186,Connie,"The Great Gatsby had a slow and sometime intimidating start. It is written in a way that people hardly understand anymore. I won’t lie, I needed to look up some of the words from its pages in the dictionary more than once. I also hesitated on readying it for almost a week after getting through the first chapter. However, yesterday I finally picked it up and commenced, and thank God I did. This was an fantastic book.It tells the famous story of unrequited love. Once you finally start getting into the life of Jay Gatsby, as told by Nick Carraway, you root for him. You know little of Gatsby except that he has loved and chased after a woman for over five years, and even though his history is a mystery (and possibly full of dark secrets) you still wish for him to succeed.Often times I complain about the ending of books and how they leave me disappointed or confused. This ending was perfect. Though the end of the story is not what I was hoping for, or expecting, it left me content and proud that I now knew the story of the Great Jay Gatsby.There is not much I can say about the book in this blog without giving away the story; the book is only 180 pages long. All I can say for certain is whether you are a hopeless romantic, or a lover of classic fiction, The Great Gatsby will not disappoint and has thoroughly earned its seat on the BBC’s 100 Best Books."
2187,Matt Thompson,"The reason Hollywood always fails to make an adequate version of Fitzgerald's book is because it's simply too big for the big screen. It may be a slim book, but it contains more than can be encapsulated in 90 minutes of auditory and visual stimulation. "
2188,Haris Khan,"Fitzgerald doesn't use a lot of descriptive scenes which made it a little hard for me to understand a bit, initially, but as I got used to it, I kind of became more and more amazed at how much he's said in this book without even saying it. I'd seen the movie when it came out so I had a little idea of what I was going through but I love how there are no saints in this book, every character has a flaw, they aren't classified into Black or White, which is what this book is trying to reflect, I guess. Loved the book and I saw the movie again after finishing it and I have to say, its one of the most loyal and amazing book-to-movie adaptations that I have ever seen.A must read!"
2189,Rebekah Rosito,"""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us.""*If you hated the movie, please read this to have some enlightenment*This novel is about dreams, hopes, and of course love. Jay Gatsby's love was the one that stirred the plot of the story. I don't usually read classics (except for Austen's and this one) but the Great Gatsby was truly an exception to my norm. Nick Carraway's narration gave me a vivid picture of how the Jazz Age really looked like in New York since it was considered as the heart of that age. All the booze, parties, and flappers were all over the place.I loved the movie version before I read the book but now when I reflect on it, the ending of the movie was not right. SERIOUSLY. In the movie no one attended Gatsby's funeral but Nick. MEANWHILE in the book THREE PEOPLE ATTENDED IT. Nick Carraway, Gatsby's father and Owl-eyed man. His death in the movie wasn't given any justice and was extremely exaggerated. Sure, the photographers and the reporters were there but Daisy and Tom was shown to be fleeting away from all the mess. In the book, it was similar but a few days (or was it months) later Nick (who was then disgusted by Tom) encountered Tom in New York.In my opinion though, there is one teeny bit of point in the book I didn't really like. The death of Jay Gatsby (where Wilson shot him in his home) was very anti-climactic. I didn't feel any emotion build up towards that scene. I was just like, ""What. Gatsby's already shot? Okaaay."" But I don't blame Fitzgerald because the book is just a narration by Carraway.Oh well that's all folks. xD Be reminded that the BOOK is always BETTER than the MOVIE. "
2190,Jocelynn Rupp,"""The Great Gatsby"" is by far the most interesting and dramatic book I have ever read. The whole entire book is based on love circles, cheating, exuberant parties and places, odd people, and the consequences of putting all your money on one bet, so to speak. The narrator of the story describes the ties between a group of people and is involved in the complete ordeal of the plot but is involved in the aspect that he sees everything that happens. We get the view of the spectator in a continually dramatic and extravagant story line. The story is centered around Jay Gatsby, a rich, head over heels, heartthrob, that only wants a girl that he had interest in long ago but that is married now. He throws big parties and shows off in hopes that one day she'll show up to a party and see his success and once again be his lover. Everything else that follows is consequence of multiples choices of cheating and violence, none of which turn out well. It really is a story that could be described as incredibly intense with a great build up to the finale. This book would obviously make a great movie even for those that have not read the book due to its drama and endless possibilities for amazing scenes of parties and passion."
2191,Eden,"5 stars“So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”The Great Gatsby is possibly the best American Classic of all times, it certainly is one of the best Classics every written.It is a perfectly portrait of the frantic, energetic and decadent Jazz Age – the Roaring Twenties – and the American dream. It is the rise and fall of Jay Gatsby and his love for the rich socialite Daisy Buchannan, as seen through the eyes of Daisy’s cousin, Nick Carraway.Being a very short book, The Great Gatsby is fast to read. I admired Gatsby’s dream and struggle to change his destiny, his dream to become bigger than he was meant to be, but it gets to a point where he starts believing his own lies and believing time would stop to wait for him.Nonetheless, Gatsby is a remarkable character with a struggle that is imposed to him by society – how could an impoverish soldier and a rich, young beauty get together otherwise? – and I am sure many readers will be able to relate to Gatsby.Being the great Classic that The Great Gatsby is, I recommend this book to everyone."
2192,Neil Hepworth,"Warning! English teacher heresy to follow!Yes, this is a marvelous book, and I think it would be a wonderful book to teach because there is so much going on here. However…I watched the new DiCaprio movie first, and it really helped me to visualize what was going on and helped me to understand the novel in the larger context. I know I would have liked it anyway, but reading the book after seeing the movie made the book come alive in a way that the paper pages wouldn’t have been able to do all by themselves. "
2193,Hannah Rossi,"The Great Gatsby, by novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a classic read that is told through the narration of main character Nick Carraway as he witnesses both the impossible romance of two opposite souls, as well as the degradation of societal values in the bourgeois 1920’s. The novel begins with Nick moving to the West Egg of Long Island, an area populated by the newly wealthy. It is from the moment of his arrival that Nick begins to tell the story of the enigmatic Jay Gatsby, and the intense infatuation that he holds for the woman that he believes to be his one true love, Daisy Buchanan. Gatsby and Daisy had met and fallen in love when both were young, but had separated due to Gatsby’s past inability to support her. However, utilizing some less than legal means, Gatsby gains wealth and fortune, though he cares about neither, and uses both to recover their lost love. 	What truly makes this book interesting, however, is Fitzgerald’s amazing use of symbolism to represent various ideas and social phenomena. In particular, I found that his use of symbolism when constructing the object of the green light to be thought provoking, as one could interpret Gatsby’s quest for it in a multitude of ways; for instance, it could be used to symbolize his idealization of Daisy and how he continually attempts to reclaim her. 	Another interesting aspect of the novel was the overarching theme of materialism leading to society’s undoing, as the drive for material wealth is eventually what leads to the deterioration of Daisy and Gatsby’s relationship. I enjoyed the way Fitzgerald seamlessly interwove this theme into his novel, as it was both subtle and pronounced. This theme is also historically accurate, as this materialistic drive was a precursor to the Great Depression. "
2194,Aziza," As I started reading this book again for my Comp 2 class, I literally could picture every scene from the latest version of the movie (yes the one with Leo in it). It felt exciting to read one section and then picture the movie scene in my head. Although, I did notice there were some things that weren't mentioned in the movie from the book, or that they had done things differently. Still, I enjoyed reading it for what... the third or fourth time, say the least.  It gave me a better understanding of the book, storyline, plot, and the characters. It's like re-dissecting a book again, over and over. You know what they say, each time you re-read the same book, you're always picking up new things about the book that you hadn't noticed before; or acquiring a better understanding of the book (more deeper I guess).  I love this book! It is one of my inner favorites, it's a Classic, as I like to say each time I hear the title. Fitzgerald does a wonderful job depicting the want to ""re-create the past"" through Gatsby's eyes, and that itself says a lot once you re-read the book and get a better understanding of things. I really loved it when Nick quotes that the others are a ""rotten crowd"" (forgive me if I'm wrong) and especially the one at the end, about getting back up and going for your dream again (good word choices for both of those).  Another thing that I liked was, how he mentions the hollowness of the house once Gatsby's gone. No more live parties, dancing, music, booze, etc. Nick can still faintly hear it, and imagine it, as a reader or the audience, I too felt the exact same feeling and emotion. I could feel the hollowness of the house inside me, that indeed, Gatsby was gone... and with it, his mark of being the wealthiest man (due to his outrageous big parties).  Great writing, now I can't wait to start reading other novels by him, especially about the Jazz Age. "
2195,Leila,I read this book in high school and I loved it then. 25 years later I finally got around to rereading it. I love Fitzgerald's descriptive style and character development. Though I must admit that I found the characters in Tender is the Night more compelling than those in Gatsby. The real payoff of the book is the last chapter. It is reflective and poignant and tender. This man could write!
2196,Sarah Marie,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald4.75 stars""And I like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”""Whenever you feel like criticizing any one, just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”It wasn’t until my freshman year of high school that I knew the name Gatsby. The new movie starring Leonardo DiCapprio was something I was intrigued by. Instantly after watching the film I added the novel to my TBR. I know it’s a big no-no to see the film before the movie, but I honestly hadn’t realized that Gatsby was a literary masterpiece. I didn’t realize it was something I would need to read in my life. I honestly think that The Great Gatsby is a book that everyone needs to read in their life. It seems that everyone knows of this novel now because of the movie. Put the movie with Leonardo out of your head because it’s better than the reading experience, but the reading experience is so amazing. I truly love Gatsby. It isn’t until a whole year after reading it that I realize it’s a classic I highly adore. Fitzgerald is a remarkable writer.""I’m glad it’s a girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool- that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.”There are a lot of things to love about Gatsby. Everything from the writing, to the brilliant quotes, the characters, the themes, and the irony is remarkable. My favorite thing about Gatsby is the irony because everything in this upscale New York posh glamour is easily tipped over with little thing. It’s horrible to see how the divide in America is prevalent.Whimsical Writing Scale: 5The main male character is Nick. Nick doesn’t get all the recognition in this story because Gatsby is really the story here, but Nick is in my opinion Fitzgerald. Nick has a lot of the same issues that Fitzgerald did and he is basically the same person. Therefore, Nick is a lot cooler when you actually start to think about who he is. The man of the hour is Gatsby. Jay Gatsby. He’s a fascinating character. He wants to be rich, but is trapped in the essence of a man destined to be poor. He’s ambitious, but also has very many faults. I can go into a whole discussion about Gatsby, but I doubt anyone wants to read my thoughts and literary opinions.Swoon Worthy Scale: 4On the surface, this story is probably the epitome of a love story gone wrong. It’s not Gatsby fault, but let’s face it Daisy is an absolutely horrible human being. She only cares about money, but it doesn’t seem like that. As the novel goes on, it becomes obvious that Daisy a material person who isn’t looking for love like she may seem to be.Tom is an even more despicable character, but he is a man who has everything. Gatsby is the thing that can take it all away. Tom is on the outside a rich racist, but his racism isn’t towards the black people as it may seem. He truly hates the poor people who are ambitiously hoping to become rich and Gatsby is the representation of the thing he wants to stomp out the most.""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy- they smashed up things and creatures and the retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they made…""Also Jordan slays and she is hands down my favorite character in Gatsby. Also she has great hair in the film.Character Scale: 5I’m just going to assume that this book is already on your TBR list and if it isn’t you should probably think about adding it because this novel is a literary masterpiece and it deserves to be.Plotastic Scale: 5Cover Thoughts: My cover is the movie adaptation and it’s ugly, but the original cover is iconic and that is something I love."
2197,Johnny,"This is my favorite book of all time. My favorite character is Jay Gatsby because he reminds me of my ambitions. Becoming a millionaire from nothing and going after the girl of his dreams. The Great Gatsby is a novel about a Gatsby and his dreams of becoming wealthy to win over the girl of his dreams. It is narrated by Nick Carraway, his neighbor and the cousin of the Daisy, Gatsby's dream girl. It takes place in the 1920s, where alcohol is prohibited, however people still drink anyways. Gatsby was a poor boy from North Dakota until he goes to war during WWI, when he comes back he meets a wealthy man, Dan Cody,who takes Gatsby under his wing and teaches him how to be rich. Unfortunately the man dies and Gatsby is taken under another rich mans wing, Meyer Wolfshiem, a organized crime kind-of guy. Once Gatsby becomes wealthy he throws parties and tries to lure Daisy into his parties by buying a house in the West Egg while she lives on the East Egg. However she never comes, although Nick is Daisy's cousin so Gatsby befriends Nick to get in touch with Daisy. However it goes sour when Daisy is already married. In addition Tom has been cheating on Daisy with Myrtle, his mistress. Until one night at an accident causes a sequence of events to take place ending with a dead man and his dreams. I cannot go into deal about the end and how it happens you just have to read the book. Which is why i would highly recommend it. It is a novel, more than a story about love, death, and desires. It has so much hidden meanings that you'll have to decipher yourself. "
2198,April,Favorite book of all time.
2199,Janet,"I honestly thought I had read this book but it was obvious after a few pages that I had not. I found it compelling and was impressed with the fluidity yet depth of Fitzgerald's prose. He is much more to my taste than Hemingway. I thought I would like Jay Gatsby more than I did, but everyone in the book had a distasteful edge. It was an engrossing read and a nice view into the era."
2200,Meagan,"What can I say, honestly? There's a lot of hype about this book and that informs people pretty heavily I think. But really, this is a novel with incredible prose, incredible characterization and one that captures both the contemporary moment while transcending it to become something timeless. The point isn't about Gatsby and Daisy. It's not about a guy who falls in love with a rich girl. It's an allegory, social commentary on the society of the time and a kind of prophetic hopelessness that pervaded Fitzgerald's life and his work. It's a beautiful novel, through and through, and the reason that people spout it as ""the great American novel"" is because it's a perfect example of what the American literary canon has set as the standard for quality literature. So it's my favorite book ever, so haters to the left, it's freaking awesome."
2201,Flavia,"I didn't know what to expect of this story, not having browsed it's title before, yet I found myself one evening with it and had a go. It came to me as a surprise how quickly I grew fond of Gatsby, despite my nature to dislike such shallow people(I of course was prejudice, he had his flaws but that was not among them),perhaps it was an omen as to the future of this tragic character.I liked him, and the more I read the more I liked him better and hated Daisy more. She is a selfish, shallow, pathetic creature, and I hated how she treated someone that showed nothing but loyalty. I grew close to tears when reading how little people truly cared for the great Gatsby, now that he was dead. The story is bitter-sweet, you get to know a great man with even greater flaws and misunderstandings that has been blindly loyal to someone that didn't deserve him. The frivolous character of the roaring 20's society is brought to light, a time when the rich were so much above law and moral conduct. As a side note, I recommend you also see the film, it stayed true to the book and it was gorgeous. "
2202,Shae Smetana,"*Spoiler Alert*  F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel, The Great Gatsby, is probably one of my favorite books. It not only show the corrupted side of humans, but how far someone is willing to go for another person. It has multiple themes that are present throughout the whole book which makes it enjoyable to read; however, some of the passages are worded weirdly, and it can get a little confusing. This book shows the difference between the two classes, the middle class and the upper class. The middle class is portrayed as the class that has morals, and believes in right and wrong. An example of this is when Mr. Wilson was looking at the eyes of T.J. Eckleburg saying that Myrtle might fool him, but not God. Or when Nick feels sick by the way the certain people in the upper class behave. The upper class is portrayed as the class that has decomposing morals. One example of this is when Daisy does not admit that she was driving the car that killed Myrtle Wilson, and instead of going to Gatsby’s funeral, she leaves. Another one is when the reader finds out that Tom cheated on Daisy. This novel does a fantastic job at making the reader think what morals and class you would fit into in an average day. I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to feel some sort of hope in everyday life, which is what Gatsby does for this book."
2203,Mollymack,"Forgive me, but I must confess:I thought Gatsby was referring to something of a Sting operation that took place in the 20s. Not a man. I was all set for a whirlwind adventure that included big ideas about humanity and a controversial commentary on the Jazz Age and... well... the type of this that would qualify this to be The American Classic. Although I was disappointed in the sense of what I thought it would be, I was not disappointed with the book.This was some of the most beautiful prose I have ever encountered. And I'm in high school; they make us read most of the good stuff. This book was everything Fitzgerald promised and more. I would go so far as to say it was perfect (which would be an interesting statement due to the numerous rewritten drafts and prints of The Great Gatsby that Fitzgerald made throughout the years).As far as themes... Nick is a very moral character and has a modest and honest outlook on the events that transpired around him and to him. In this social chaos he is able to find the message that the universe is sending him and all of us. The last lines of the book: ""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter- tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning-- So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past"" (152). A simple theme to a romantic and devastating story... wow. I.. I don't know how to put it in Laman's terms without it losing it's mystical and ominous quality. Basically, if you will have faith and put forth the works, whatever you desire can be yours. Gatsby made the mistake of perseverating on a long lost dream that he believed was still attainable. And although it was never to be his in the first place, because of all his work, the impossible came within reach. But the jealous, cruel, confusing, and careless natures of humans stripped him from his hope. From his life!Nick is the only decent human being in this whole book. What really stands out to me as the defining event for these characters is when they travel into New York one sweltering afternoon and Gatsby and Tom put all the cards on the table. Nick has the advantage of being an onlooker, his scope not warped by passion or an unattainable vision. He saw that afternoon, the defining flaws of each of these people. When combined they would be fatal, but all Nick could do was watch it unravel. I think his rudest awaking to the world was when no one showed up for Gatsby's funeral. Hundreds arrived for his glamorous parties, but only one, the drunk old man who sat one night in his library not even knowing Gatsby at all, showed to honor him when he died. It really shows the honorable character of Nick that he befriended the broken man Gatsby was, hiding behind his money and mystery. In the beginning he says that he never agreed with Gatsby's lifestyle and never in the course of the book does he say he cared about him (except once, when questioned by Gatsby's father if he was a friend). But he viewed his excursions with Gatsby as a ""privileged glimpse"" into the human heart.The most uncomfortable thing to me about this story is the known affair of Tom with Mrs. Wilson. Daisy knows, and she addresses it underhandedly a few times, but no one ever openly talks about it with Tom when Daisy is present and honestly, Tom (who is more of a big kid) gives the impression that he has no idea his wife knows of the affair. I kept waiting for someone to bring it up when they were at the hotel that stifling afternoon. It was so wrong for Gatsby and Daisy to be hanging out, but no one thought it was wrong for Tom to be sleeping around?? That was really frustrating. It seemed only Nick ever showed any disgust at the fact. This was a real sign of the times to me as a social commentary on the 1920s.I felt a little squeamish in the description of the hit and run where Mrs. Wilson played the victim. But it was still beautiful somehow it its... grotesque-ness.I wouldn't say I think everyone should read this book as a requirement or whatever. But I highly recommend it. It was beautiful and entertaining and tragic and if it lacks certain elements to be THE classic, it has done enough in my eyes to be A classic. So there. "
2204,Noeleen,"This was my first time to read The Great Gatsby. I knew absolutely nothing about it and I’ve never seen any movies, so I didn’t know what to expect at all. I feel like I’m the last one to arrive at the party. I’m so glad that I have now eventually had an opportunity to read it. For such a short book and what should have been a day’s reading, it took me several days to read because there’s just so much to digest and because I didn’t want to skim over any of the beautiful prose and imagery. This is truly a symbolic novel addressing such themes as the American Dream, excess, materialism, capitalism and love, to name but a few. I include a ‘love’ theme but only to a certain extent, as in my opinion the ‘love’ theme is highly debatable. I don’t think any of these characters really loved each other at all but rather loved the idea of each other.Jay Gatsby and friends, what horrible, deceptive, arrogant, greedy, false, unlikeable characters you all are, yet you all served a great purpose within these pages. I disliked all of the characters, their excesses, their dishonesty, their untrustworthiness and their sheer love of money and extravagance. Fitzgerald managed to create such phony characters to convey everything that is inherently wrong in the world and yet he placed them within the pages of some of the most beautiful and lyrical writing, descriptions and phrases that I have rarely read in any book. Even though the novel is comparable to a Greek tragedy, and yes it is sad, I couldn’t help feeling that all of the characters got their just desserts in the end, even Gatsby. For me, Daisy’s character was the most dislikeable. I don’t know whether I felt sorry for her or I just wanted to shake her for her stupidity and shallowness.I absolutely loved this book. I rarely, if ever, re-read books but this is one that I will definitely re-visit again, the writing is just too beautiful for it only to be read once in a lifetime. I could quite happily discuss this book for months and still find something new to think about within it. I can’t comment on whether this book is 'the great American novel'...my lovely friends in the US would be better placed to answer that than I would, but for me it was 'great'"
2205,Sergio ⚽,"East Egg a place where a get together becomes a massive party all lead by one man who is only known by those rumors spread about him. Where the man that seems to have it all has nothing at all, who in his attempt to retrieve his old love nothing is achieved. And the heart of a once innocent woman becomes hard as a rock that can only be achieved by money. The Great Gatsby is like those soap operas that you take your date to see only because they want to. Yet once it begins you realize that you are more into it than your initial guest. Like many moments in life we tend to support the underdog because we see ourselves in them and that is what is felt about this main character Gatsby. A formal Gatsby, passionate and mysterious standing at his door steps as he sees his whole life being a complete lie in which his only real goal is to get his first love back in his arms. The book is a box of mixed emotions all put into pages and letters it keeps you wondering what will happen next even after you set it down. Then you realize that once you have picked it up again what you find out next is nothing you expected at all. Gatsby becomes like that boyfriend or girlfriend that you don't even know anything about unless you keep picking at it he becomes a man of many faces and many lies. Still you find yourself rooting him on every time even though the final attempts to get the love of his life leads to an unexpected twist to the end. This book was suppose to be a month reading but I found myself finishing it in a week because i just could not set it down. I would find myself in class daydreaming about what would happen next. The author does such an astonishing job of describing the characters that everytime a new one would come up you could picture that person as if to be someone you had once encountered throughout your life.Even though the book could get a little confusing at times you could always find yourself making out the big picture as if to be solving a mystery or putting together a one thousand piece puzzle. So if you are someone who enjoys romantic-mysterious-dramas this is indeed a book that will have you stuck on it as if glued to you fingers and the only way to put it down is by finishing it."
2206,Chase Stevens,"I saw the Baz Lurhmann movie when it was in theaters, tinting my reading experience, but this book is so densely rich and rewarding that I'm simply glad I had the pleasure of reading it.In a way, seeing the movie did help because Fitzgerald only vaguely alludes to major plot points I might have otherwise missed. [SPOILER] (Can you even spoil The Great Gatsby at this point?) Even knowing what was coming up, I still needed to go back twice or thrice to pick up that Gatsby had been killed.Regardless, it's easy to see why every high school student in America is required to read this book. Fitzgerald's masterpiece is literary gold and one of my newest favorite books."
2207,Annie Sirois,"I quite enjoyed Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby because of it's fast pace and constant drama with Gatsby. The novel was not overwhelming because Nick Caraway was a neutral, undramatic character himself who described the story in a subjective tone. Gatsby was a well defined character who provoked a lot of mystery throughout the novel, though in the end he became very relatable. Once the reader discovers that Gatsby had cheated his wealth they do not despise him but rather sympathize with him. We have all been in a position where we are willing to do anything for someone we love, though sometimes this person does not return the passion. The theme of the American dream throughout The Great Gatsby is intriguing and keeps the reader hooked. The excitement of the roaring twenties adds to the excitement of the American dream. "
2208,Judy Grace,"This is the book that made me cry big time at 3 a.m.F. Scott Fitzgerald is always a hard read, but you just got to be patient because the book really has touching parts. I guess I overrated this one because the friends I told the story about didn't appreciate it when they read the book. But this one really is something. Set in an era when women presented themselves as luxuries and when men were lulled by such luxuries, the story juxtaposed the lives of a helpless lover (Jay), an unsympathetic woman whose breath smells like money (Daisy), a despicable double-crosser (Tom) and a foolish mistress (Myrtle) using the perspective of Nick Carraway (the only one, in my opinion, who knew Jay). This story presented most characters as victims - of society, unhappy marriage, deceitful affection and money. In the end, my heart goes to Gatsby. His was such a lonely, lonely life. ""He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths--so that he could 'Come over' some afternoon to a stranger's garden."""
2209,Tyler McHaley,"After reading quite a bit of Hemingway and other contemporaries of Fitzgerald, I can say that this novel is quite a change of pace for me and a breath of fresh air. The characters could have been more developed, and the story dragged a few times during the narrative. Still, I found that there was much less unnecessary detail or trivial ponderings.I suppose I also compare this kind of novel to others of today, like the thrillers and fast-paced dramas of Patterson and Grisham. Though the latter type of reading can be quite entertaining, I find that I am more drawn to literary types of work like this one, if simply because this type of work lasts for a lifetime, whereas the others last for a year or two until the next book is published. Perhaps, I'm being too hard on today's authors, who want success and rightfully so. However, I would like to think that a novel that provokes our inner tendencies and makes us look of the world differently is worthy of a place of honor in our society, and, especially, in our literary nature."
2210,Rui Alves de Sousa,"E quando todas as atenções estão viradas para a adaptação cinematográfica de Baz Luhrmann e protagonizada por Leonardo DiCaprio (e que até tem sido um relativo sucesso nas salas de cinema portuguesas), eu decidi pôr mãos à obra e saciar um dos meus maiores desejos literários: ler «O Grande Gatsby». E depois de uma leitura assaz devoradora, de uma obra que, constatei, é completamente de génio, apenas posso confirmar, como muitos já o disseram, a intemporalidade da história de Fitzgerald: a história de Jay Gatsby e todas as obscuridades que rodeiam o seu passado, narradas na primeira pessoa por Nick Carraway, que teve o prazer de conhecer essa excêntrica e complexa personagem, fazem-nos entrar, de uma forma profunda, num mundo que não é o nosso, que olhamos de uma distância considerável mas que, no fim de contas, não nos importávamos de, por uma vez, podermos nele participar. Sim, porque apesar de todos os problemas que Gatsby, ou os ""amigos"" que o rodeiam, geram ao longo da narrativa (muitos deles por culpa da relação entre ele e Daisy, uma rapariga completamente desprovida de algum interesse - a meu ver), quem não desejou ver as festas da mansão de Gatsby ao vivo, e não se limitar ""apenas"" ao que a imaginação a literatura nos permite conceber (e que, muitas vezes, nos leva a ideias e conceitos tão distantes da realidade das coisas)... que atire a primeira pedra.«O Grande Gatsby» é um romance de crítica e de exposição da sociedade, através destas pessoas que nunca seriam um exemplo ou um modelo de vida para alguém no mundo. Grande parte das pessoas que rodeiam Gatsby não passam de gente oca e banal, que apenas se aproveita do dinheiro que este possui e que utiliza de uma forma desenfreada. Quando há dinheiro, há amigos, mas na obra o poder do dinheiro confunde-se com o poder do amor, e aquele dito universal que muitos adoram apregoar aos sete ventos tem o seu quê de verídico: ""o dinheiro e as paixões são as duas coisas que fazem o mundo girar"". É o romance entre Daisy e Gatsby, é a desventura entre Nick e Jordan Baker, é o secretismo das infidelidades do marido de Daisy... tudo, em «O Grande Gatsby», é demais condicionado pelas tais duas coisas que comandam o planeta. E no exemplo dos exageros e atribulações deste caricato (e icónico) conjunto de personagens, encontramos uma metáfora preciosa, e humana, sobre a nossa própria vida. Talvez aqui Fitzgerald estivesse a fazer o seu próprio exame de consciência, mas como não sou um investigador literário do autor, mais vale não continuar a teorizar coisas que, muito provavelmente, nada têm a ver com a realidade. Mas que «O Grande Gatsby» tem um pendor autobiográfico, isso ninguém pode negar.Justamente considerado uma das obras primas da literatura universal (está incluído em, praticamente, todas as listas literárias alguma vez feitas que versam sobre esse ""tema""), «O Grande Gatsby» sofreu o mesmo mal de muitos grandes tesouros da cultura mundial: não foi um sucesso quando foi pela primeira vez publicado, durante a década de 20. Contudo, tornou-se a obra mais popular do seu autor, e deve ser, provavelmente, um dos livros mais ""imortais"" de sempre, e irá continuar a impulsionar gerações, a ser polémico e atual e a fazer correr rios de tinta a seu respeito. Algo que se deve a toda a fantástica narrativa engendrada por F. Scott Fitzgerald, como também graças às suas deliciosas (e devorantes) descrições, e à linguagem genial e subtil que utilizou para contar esta sua história. Uma história que ultrapassa fronteiras e que é uma lição de vida para toda a Humanidade."
2211,Lisett Vahesalu,"Suur Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald.1. Teose tegevus toimub Long Islandil 1920. aastatel.2. Peategelane on Jay Gatsby, rikas, kahtlase minevikuga, sarmikas kuid üksildane mees. 3. Põhiprobleemiks on Jay Gatsby unelm ühel päeval Daisy endale saada, seejuures naist idealiseerides, mis loob suure lõhe reaalsusega. 4. Nick Carraway kolib West Eggi Gatsby häärberi kõrvale ning hakkab aktsiaturul karjääri tegema. Ta külastab ka Daisy Buchananit, kes on talle kolmanda põlve nõbu. Seejuures tutvub ka Daisy mehe Tom Buchanani ja tennisemängija Jordan Bakeriga, kellega mehel mõni aega suhe kestab. Tom Buchananil on ka armuke, keda ta Nickile uhkelt tutvustab, nimelt omab vana ja rumal George Wilson keset tuhamägi garaazi. Tema elujõuline naine Myrtle ongi Tomi väljavalitu. Suveõhtutel toimuvad Gatsby elamises suured peod, kus shampus voolab ojadena, pidu kestab hommikuni ja loendamatul hulgal voorib läbi tänamatuid külalisi. Läbi Jordani jõuab Nickini seletus Gatsby suurepärastele pidudele, nimelt soovib ta sinna meelitada Daisyt, kellega neil nooruspõlves armulugu oli, kuid mis jäi soiku, kuna Gatsby oli vaene ja sõjaväkke ning seejärel Oksfordi õppima läks. Kui Daisy kutsutakse Nicki juurde teed jooma, kohtub ta taas Gatsbyga, kes talle oma maja näitab. Peale mõnda koosviibimist Gatsby juures jõuab Tom Gatsby ja Daisy armuloole jälile. Gatsby nõuab, et Daisy tunnistaks, et pole Tomi viimase viie aasta jooksul tegelikult armastanudki, kuid naine ei suuda seda ja soovib oma mehe juurde tagasi. Kui hüsteeriline Daisy New Yorgist West Eggi sõidab, ajab ta alla auto poole tormanud Myrtle’i. Tom ütleb George Wilsonile, et kollane auto, millega ta naine tapeti, kuulus Gatsbyle ja leinas mees tabab Jay. Tom ja Daisy ning Nick lahkuvad West Eggilt. 5. „Ei ükski lihast ning verest olend suuda võistelda selle viirastuskehastusega, mida inimene on võimeline talletama oma südamesse.“„Gatsby uskus rohelist tuld, seda ohjeldamatut tulevikku, mis meie eest iga aastaga ikka enam ja enam taandub. Tookorg lipsas ta meil käest, aga mis sellest- homme jookseme kiiremini, sirutame käed kaugemale välja... Ja siis ühel ilusal hommikul... Nii me rügame edasi, võitleme vooluga, ja meie laevukesed kantakse tagasi minevikku.“"
2212,Ami,I do believe that this was the book that earned me a '5' on the literature AP test. 
2213,Ye Lin Aung,"As I've watched the film before, I have a sense of how the plot starts, reach the climax and ends eventually. But the book still amazed me in several ways.""Old spot, you can't repeat the past""."
2214,Alexa,"Holy moly, how did I make it to 25 without ever having read this book? It was great!Honestly, I'm glad I didn't read it in high school. I don't think I would have loved it nearly as much then. F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing is so lovely. Most of the characters are not people I'd want to be friends with in real life, but they were all so intricate and interesting. I totally want to crash a Gatsby-style party. Or be invited to one. Whatever.I really and truly knew nothing about this book before I read it (aside from it being a classic and that everyone and their uncle read it in high school). A few pages in, a friend mentioned that it was a sad book. I was very surprised to hear that and immediately started thinking of all sorts of sad ending possibilities ... I did not expect the one that happened. And, yes, it was sad."
2215,Suzy,"This ""Great American Novel"" is so beautifully written, I was often awestruck by the prose, backtracking in the audio to listen again. It astutely captures the Roaring 20's in its short 180 pages (or in its just under 5 hours of audio), the years after WWI where societal rules are breaking apart and, it seems, anyone can be anything. Or at least anyone can pretend to be anything. And anyone can find out that what one aspires to or pretends to be doesn't necessarily bring the satisfaction or outcome one imagines. Nick Carraway, the narrator, was the perfect person to expose both the shallowness, but also the attraction, of the lifestyle lived by Gatsby and Tom and Daisy Buchanan. His Midwestern point of view is the perfect foil for Fitzgerald to comment on the times."
2216,Amy,"This has to be one of my favourite books. Initially, I found it very hard going, as Fitzgerald's language is quite archaic. In fact, I went to see the film just to make sense of period in which the story is set (ashamedly so, as I prefer to read the book before I see the film However, I did enjoy the film). I returned to reading it and found it a lot easier to understand and was now able envisage what Fitzgerald was describing, and I really drawn in by the story. And while the novel ends tragically, in my eyes, I saw no other way for it to end. There were only two characters that I actually liked in the whole novel; Nick and Gatsby. I liked Nick because as a reader I felt like I could relate with him, as I was as just confused and curious towards the world he was living in as he was, and I felt sympathy for him at the end of the novel. And I loved Gatsby because he was so interesting; he had so many layers to his character and throughout the novel I could not help but question what the 'true' Gatsby was like because he was shrouded in so much mystery that I was uncertain of him at many moments in the novel. It's fair to say that his character kept me hooked throughout.I did not like Daisy (initially I thought she was OK, but after re-reading the beginning of the novel,I found her a bit pathetic and self-centred) and I didn't like Jordan either, as I found that she was self-centred too. Tom is the kind of person I would avoid in reality, and his complete lack of empathy for anyone else but himself was frustrating. I didn't mind Myrtle or Wilson, and felt quite sympathetic towards them too in the end.The reason for why I didn't think that the story couldn't have ended any other way is that I don't think Gatbsy would have been happy without Daisy and would have kept longing for her, and she obviously was no longer interested in him, and so she stayed with Tom for protection (in my opinion) and this is why I hated Daisy so much; because Gatbsy would have done anything for her. So his death was the only way in which he could be at peace. However, I still found it very sad and unfair.Although the novel is supposed to be a tragedy, I don't feel that way towards it, because of how I feel about the ending and because of the parties which Nick describes (and which I would love to go - they sound like so much fun). Due to the language used and how the different characters lives and actions intertwined to build up to the climax of the novel kept hooked throughout. The Great Gatsby is easily one of the most fascinating and exciting reads that sits on my bookshelf."
2217,Cinthya Tamayo,"Oh Jay Gatsby, I felt that you were hurt through out the book. I honestly think your life was never as happy as you deserved. I liked you. You were hopeful. I honestly believe that you were somewhat of a guardian angel to the people of New York, and yet you yourself never lived in utopia. I think that the reason this happened to you was that you cared too much about people who didn't give a crap about you. all the people you surrounded yourself with were all ignorant and simply didn't care. I believe you had everything anyone could've wanted but nothing you ever needed. I kinda feel that that bullet was for the best in the end. even if you continued to live, you wouldn't be happy. I hope you are happier now, and know now that I cared about you old sport"
2218,Lydia,"I read this book in high school about eight years ago. I don't remember what I thought about it then, but I just re-read it to prepare for the movie (like many others). I listened to the audio book over the course of two long drives, and Anthony Heald is an EXCELLENT narrator. He brings the book's first-person narration to life with his varying - but not overly dramatic (if that's even possible in this book) - voices and inflection matched to each character. You can tell he really did his homework for this book, making sure to understand the characters and how they would have spoken - even going so far as to actually sing a snatch of song sung in the book rather than just reciting it as so many narrators do.My fiance was very irritated at all the people on facebook celebrating the release of the movie with Gatsby parties, dressing up and the like, because he thinks the parties are not something you're necessarily meant to wish to attend due to the more fabulous lifestyle. To him, the people at the lavish parties thrown at Gatsby's house seem to actually be rather pathetic behind all the glamour - especially some, if not all, of our main characters. I agree with this assessment; while the glamorous life may seem fun, if you go home at the end of the night miserable because you're living a lie to maintain an image, you will not be happy.All that said, this novel is very well written - excellent imagery and vocabulary throughout with a compelling story that gives people a glance into the lives of the rich and fabulous in F. Scott Fitzgerald's Jazz Age. I see now why this book is so frequently found in high school classrooms - it contains so many scholarly aspects of literature to discuss! Internal and external conflict, imagery, narration style, themes...the list goes on and on. But I'm a math teacher, not English - so I'll stop there before I make Miss K shake her head in despair for my forgetting all the proper terms for the concepts. :)"
2219,Suzi,"F. Scott Fitzgerald is not for everyone, or so say some. But his genius is telling the untellable in us. He says what we feel, but cannot say. And this particular story is, of course, a paste up of our culture, of how people can reinvent themselves in a Western Puritan sense through self conscious redemption and choices. But this book has a strange big lonely heart to it. An emptiness that makes you feel almost queasy. Jay Gatsby. Brilliant. Rich. Handsome. Has the whole world. How did he get it? What price did he pay for it? ""It"" is never known but hinted at. Why do we live our lives in constant striving for...? Why must we be the best, have the most, be the most charming, be People Magazine's stud of the year. Who loves us when we don't love ourselves. Who are we when we have stacks and stacks of perfectly starched and ironed shirts all packed neatly and most never to be worn. Why do you love her? Why does she love Gatsby. What is vapid? The opposite of rapid? We all want to be Jay Gatsby, but if we think about it, we don't... or better said, most of us don't."
2220,Daphne,"This book is both wonderfully tragic and romantic, yet for the entire book all I could think of was"
2221,Srivatsan Sridharan,"There is no compelling storyline in The Great Gatsby. There are no thrilling action sequences or gripping suspense. Hell, there is no heart-wrenching catastrophic drama either (except in the very end).The Great Gatsby is something else. It’s an exquisite piece of art, the kind of art that should be framed and put inside the Louvre, right next to the Mona Lisa. I must say that it’s one of the finest pieces of literature I’ve ever read. The characters in The Great Gatsby are so real that when I close my eyes, I can imagine them walking around me. It feels as if I’ve known Gatsby and Nick for years and all I’m doing now is just reading their personal diaries or something. To achieve all this with less than 200 pages, without any of the characters having gone through significant enough trauma to evoke empathy, is nothing short of remarkable. There is some sort of magic in Fitzgerald’s words - an elegant prose, flowing like a pristine river through the garden of Eden, coupled with sharp observations of the human emotion and thought process. No wonder, this book is rated by Modern Library as the 2nd best English language fictional work of all time!"
2222,Stewart,"	If I recall, I read ""The Great Gatsby"" on my own in high school or college, then reread it in my 30s. If these memories are correct, I estimate it had been 30 or more years since I had put my nose in this book. With all the hubbub about Baz Lurhmann’s movie, I decided to give F. Scott Fitzgerald’s 1925 novel another read.	I remember the novel as a gorgeous re-creation of an era: the Roaring Twenties, the age of Prohibition and bootlegging, Wall Street fever, flappers, and jazz. The book certainly contains this, but it’s not just what Fitzgerald writes about but how he writes that puts this book so high on many people’s list of best American novels.	His descriptions are superb. The image of the “whip and snap” of the curtains, buffeted by the bay breeze through the open windows in Tom and Daisy Buchanan’s Long Island house when Nick Carraway first visits in early summer 1922 has always stayed in my mind. The image was brought to screen in the 1974 and 2013 movies.	Fitzgerald’s description of Jay Gatsby after he was reunited with Daisy: “He must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass.”	The valley of the ashes was brought to life in this paragraph: “This is a valley of ashes – a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.”	Then there are the surprising adjectives: “Presbyterian nymphs” on the ceiling of the Manhattan restaurant that Jay and Nick visit. Or the “orgastic future” that Jay believes in. Or Nick’s thought about Gatsby: the “foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.” 	We make it to the eloquent and enigmatic final page. We revisit the green light at the end of the pier and read of the dark fields of the republic. And “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”	The amazing thing about this novel is that so much – the eloquence, the amazing descriptions and the jarring adjectives, the look at the excesses, stock market speculation, and corruption of the 1920s (relevant to the 2000s and 2010s), the portrait of the very rich (or the 1 percent, in today’s terms), and the ruminations about the past and humans’ inability to repeat it – is jammed into a mere 180 pages."
2223,Michael Audet,"It's easy for me to forget just how much I love The Great Gatsby.My first encounter with Gatsby was when I read it for the first time in eighth grade. Yeah, I was that kind of kid. I fell in love with the prose immediately, I was content just to read it out loud to myself and listen to the gorgeous sounds of the words. My understanding of the novel, due to the fact that I was, like, 13, was rather pedestrian. It basically extended this far: they're all chasing the American Dream, all feel hollow in their excess, Eckleburg = God. That was it.I've read Gatsby multiple times since, and each time my understanding is deepened. True, it's a novel about horribly shallow people, hypocritical people, blind people, annoying people, selfish people. The narrator is possessed with all the personality and conviction of a damp dishcloth. It's a story ruled by love, but none of the characters seem to know what love is. Daisy is more self-aware about the clothes on her back than the baby in her house. The narrator is so supremely unreliable that it's easy to wonder if any of this is even worth reading. It should be a boring, deplorable read, but it's not.Fitzgerald has a supreme attention to detail, every page brings forth a beautiful description, deepens our understanding, introduces a symbol. Everyone who's survived through an American high school has probably talked about the green light to such an excessive point that I won't bother diving into that pool, but there's so much going on if you stop and look. Gatsby is a short novel but it's also a long one: each sentence carries weight and meaning.Is The Great Gatsby the great American novel? Does that even exist? While I won't put all my eggs in Fitzgerald's basket (especially since the idea of a singular Great American Novel is, well, laughable), Gatsby is a masterful work, no doubt. In a way, even if I'm aware now of all the social commentary and all of the strings working behind the scenes, what I initially loved about The Great Gatsby is still what brings me back to it time and time again.""Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs, so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled, and so I drew her up again closer, this time to my face."""
2224,Ricardo Alfonso,"To put things simply, this novel is about the American Dream. Yes, that ever elusive ideal which few people can satisfactorily describe. It's a good thing, then, that F. Scott Fitzgerald would be the one to put words to it. Not only does Fitzgerald bring that airy concept down to our level, he gives it a name: Daisy Buchanan.Compare the two dominant alpha males, Tom and Gatsby, fighting over the lone Daisy. The former is a pampered dilettante, the latter a self-made man (though made in ways which run contrary to established mores). They're not fighting over a girl, they're fighting over the American Dream. Here we see capitalism made manifest, exposed as the zero-sum game that it is. There is only one Daisy, and they can't both have her. In the book, Daisy seems to make the choice for herself, but we are quickly shown that her fate has already been decided. She is no more in control of her own destiny as George and Myrtle are in control of their economic situation. Yes, Gatsby deserves Daisy by pure virtue of how desperately he pines for her. But he was not born into wealth nor did he graduate from an Ivy League school; he built a facade off of lies and thievery in order to get close enough to speak with Daisy at eye level. And we all know how sturdy a house made of cards is.Beyond the immense plot, there are some negative aspects in Gatsby, all subjective in my opinion. The apathetic narrator, Nick Carraway, manages to be spectacularly uninteresting. His romance with Jordan Baker seems a bit forced and unnecessary. The story also manages to get carried away in its own myth- weaving from time to time, talking for pages about minor details which don't seem to fit the overall flow of the prose. My biggest problem is with Fitzgerald's handling of the Gatsby character. I understand that he's supposed to be a mysterious fellow, which is part of his appeal, but the information we're given about him is flimsy, as though we're expected to doubt every word of it. This makes it hard to follow and connect with the story's titular protagonist, and it leaves those annoying loose ends unconnected even upon the book's conclusion. As a character, Gatsby's motivations always seemed kind of murky and unjustified, and without any solid background information on the man, the reader is left gasping for air as they struggle to swallow the situations as they unfold. Those minor caveats aside, Fitzgerald has a way with words, and the book is very quotable. He is able to tell a concise and meaty story without adding fluff to give the book an artificially voluminous page count. He is able to paint amazing pictures with language, and manages the difficult task of balancing the stark reality of modernism with the more artistic conventions of symbolism and allegory. As a documentary of the 20's, it has few rivals.If you don't mind a haphazard journey into a man's obsessive quest for total and complete perfection, then I guarantee that you will enjoy this book as thoroughly as I did."
2225,Terry Cornell,"I realized I never read the book, after seeing the 2013 film version starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby. Then I discovered my wife's copy in the bookshelf in our family room. I'm not qualified to write a review of such a classic, but will make an attempt. Just Fitzgerald's ability to transport you to a fictionalized world of 1920's era New York is amazing without the tragic story line. An extremely thin book in size, but not in story or Fitzgerald's selection of apt words. I believe the 2013 film was an excellent depiction of the book, while the book does fill in a few minor holes that the movie failed to make clear. "
2226,Suzanne Wheatley,"I was recently invited to participate in a panel on the XM Radio show ""The Big Read"" to discuss The Great Gatsby. Why? Because I had off-handedly commented to a radio-producer friend that I re-read Gatsby every year. When I re-read the book this time it was every bit as good, but I reacted very differently to it. In truth -- I had lied. I did used to re-read Gatsby every year, but many years had lapsed since the last reading. This time around I was much older, and no longer reaching so expectantly for the brass ring of everything life could and should give me. The glamour of wealth, sex and cocktails no longer hold as much allure. For that reason, I was much more aware of the Gatsby's shadow side -- the corruption of all the characters, even the honest Nick Carraway. Gatsby himself was not blameless, even if more pure than the ""careless"" Buchanans. In any event -- I'm sure most of you have read this book at least once, perhaps back in high school as a requirement. Pick it up again. The lyricism of the writing is breathtaking. And like most great works of art, it reveals something new about itself and about you on each re-evaluation."
2227,Joselito Honestly and Brilliantly,"It cannot be the love story for it is an overwrought plot, like a repetitive gravestone in a vast cemetery. Poor, good-looking boy. Rich, good-looking girl. Love. He leaves, appalled by his love's helplessness, but alive by its hopefulness. He makes a silent vow. He ceases not in loving. She is left with their uncertain love yet is surrounded by other loves' many promises, moneyed and equally good-looking. She falls for one. They marry.Five years. Poor, good-looking boy comes back a man now rich. With his love that has not died. Her love for him hasn't either. He now has money to buy their love a ticket for the eternal train. They can go away, far, and live happy forever.They don't. But even so, even if their love ends up empty, it does not infuse the story with newness. In fiction and in real life, anyway, love almost always betrays its hollowness. This is not a novel you can recommend to friends because it has a story. But what then if not its story?CLEAN. Of all the words, it is this which came to me when I began to really see what this novel is. Not boringly, antiseptic clean like a well-scrubbed toilet bowl, but a dreamlike clean, like floating along a cloud formation, all white, not a speck of dust in sight.I am babbling, of course. You won't understand what I am saying unless this novel captures your complete attention while reading it, as it had captured mine. Read this one sentence, with the rich girl Daisy and her husband Tom, their friend Nick narrating:""They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light.""Clean. Even if I try, I do not think you would understand why I began to suspect here, on page 24 where this sentence is found, that I am reading something really special (a confession: I started to read this a long time ago but gave it up bored). It was some sort of a warning as it turned out to be. For later, I'd almost surrendered weary from the untiring assault of brilliance. Like in here, Gatsby reminiscing about a solitary evening with Daisy:""...One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalk really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees--he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder. ""His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.""Tell me, which kiss in literature can come close to this one?"
2228,Cassidy,"One of my absolute favorite books of all time! As most high school students were, I was forced to read this for school and had no idea that I would love it as much as I did. It was so captivating! I love how Nick is the quiet ""observer"" through all of the chain of events. His insight is an unbiased look into the lives of the people he interacts with. He gets so caught up with everyone and their problems, that we actually tend to forget that he himself is a character, instead of just a narrator. He describes himself as a tolerant, open-minded listener, so he is the perfect person to tell this story. I love this story because it is an interesting insight to the lives of the upper-class citizens living in the 20s. You would expect them to be interesting and fun, considering their party lifestyles. Instead, we come to find out that they're dull, hollow, conceited, and careless. Their money is what makes them, and what ultimately ends the affair between Gatsby and Daisy. Daisy is incapable of real and genuine emotions because of her careless lifestyle. Any sign of weakness or ""ugliness"" in a human-being sends her running away. She cannot handle Gatsby because he is ""real"", and his genuine qualities ultimately lead up to his death after taking the blame for killing Myrtle. I love this book so much! 5 stars!"
2229,Henna Pääkkönen,"Disturbing. Sad. Shocking. Powerful.And why am I rating such a book at five stars?Because it is an American masterpiece and it shook me.Fitzgerald's witty and metaphorical writing, full of second senses and in-between-the-lines meanings, accounts post WW I NY living of the rich and the famous whose externally beautiful and golden lives shatter into million pieces, as a mirror hit with a brick.THe book is mystical, superfluous, shocking and beautiful and the last paragraphs are amongst the most powerful ones I ve ever read. "
2230,Chelsea,"This is the great American novel, in all its glittering glory, tragic truth, and horrible humanity."
2231,Nicole Rollins,"Who needs Nicholas Sparks? The Great Gatsby is a love story that manages to never describe all the juicy details Sparks would spend pages narrating. Instead, Fitzgerald composes a love story that showcases obsession and sacrifice at its finest, and when the long lost lovers are finally reunited, its left for the reader to infer what actually takes place between Gatsby and Daisy. Do I feel cheated? Absolutely not! In fact, I didn't even realize the omission of such ""Sparksian"" detail until Myrtle was already dead. How did Fitzgerald manage to move the story along so quickly and beautifully, that I didn't even realize he ""cheated me"" out of the very thing I was waiting for, for Gatsby and Daisy to be reunited and immerse themselves in the other's company? I will say, the story is short, and that's probably where he could have added bulk if he really wanted to. But, if you can write a masterpiece that is not only a quick read but also somewhat of an illusion, I would say you deserve all the accolades of a successful writer.A last thought (one of word choice): why does Fitzgerald choose the word 'holocaust' to describe the homicide of Gatsby and the suicide of Wilson? Seems like an odd choice of a word, but there has to be a reason..."
2232,SusanInSedalia,Gorgeous audio book. 
2233,Karla Velázquez,"http://karlogoldenpoints.blogspot.mx/... Scott Fitzgerald nació en el año de 1896. Su influencia se remonta a escritores como Oscar Wilde. En esta novela, El Gran Gatsby que fue escrita en 1925, podemos encontrar dicha influencia en el naturalismo de la obra, en los bien elaborados párrafos y en las descripciones pretenciosamente perfectas.Gatsby es un contrabandista que regresa después de cinco años a buscar al amor de su juventud. Junto con una vida suntuosa y grandes cantidades de dinero pretende conquistar en Daysi, lo que no pudo hacer hace años: su vida llena de lujos y despreocupación.Sin duda esta novela es una de las grandes obras de la literatura universal, es un imperdible en nuestra lista de pendientes a leer. La soltura, belleza y constitución de cada párrafo vale más que cinco estrellas. Además de lecciones de vida y la crítica hacia la sociedad esnobista que maneja el autor es un crudo relato que sigue aplicándose a nuestro tiempo.La muerte del amor por encima de la vida materialista y un héroe que apegándose a la creencia del poder de esos ideales, pretende recuperar al amor de su vida, es la primicia que encontraremos en la historia de Scott Fitzgerald."
2234,The Pixie Reader,"
Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.
I did not expect to enjoy it this much considering the many failed attempts to read it previously. But I finally found the right moment to pick it up again and I couldn't put it down. Nick Carraway's voice as a narrator was just enthralling. I was touched by his friendship with Jay Gatsby and his loyalty to him. I might not approve the path Gatsby took to fulfill his „American dream”, but his his sparkling optimist bordering on naiveté was quite endearing. It was so dispiriting to see (view spoiler)[Gatsby's life and dreams shattered (hide spoiler)].The story might be set the 1920s, but the themes tackled are all so current. There's so much gloom underneath all that glamour that the feeling of desolation still lingers with me, days after finishing this book. "
2235,Tzippy,"On paper, I shouldn't like The Great Gatsby. (I'm sorry, that phrase is ambiguous in this context. What I mean to say is, when you look at the attributes of this book in and of themselves, then objectively, it doesn't seem to be a book that would appeal to me.) Every last character is unlikable. And I've previously said, on this very website, the following:Stories where I can't connect to the main character don't usually appeal to me, even if they're satire and I'm supposed to dislike them.And yet, it works. Gloriously. Gatsby is one of my all-time favorites. It might be the evocative writing, the NYC backdrop, (the way that you can almost taste the hot summer city nights), the sense of melancholy that pervades the entire story. The way Daisy and Gatsby are both pathetic and sympathetic. The freaking symbolism.Jordan. I can't explain it, but she's the best. My copy of Gatsby from high school has all of her lines highlighted.The way Kate Beaton's Gatsby comics make me absolutely roll on the floor:http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php..."
2236,Mai Eissa,"the purest love story ever.. Gatsby is the man of every girl's dreamthe man who would give anything and everything to the woman he loves.. even if she doesn't deserve such treatmentenjoyed the novel.. cried at the end, though I find it fair enoughGatsby is such a fairy creature.. he deserves a better beloved, a better company and a better life."
2237,Diana,"Este libro me ha dejado completamente fascinada. Su historia, la manera en que está escrito, sus personajes, todo. La historia se desarrolla en la vida americana del siglo XX. Esta historia está llena de misterios, comenzando por nuestro protagonista Jay Gatsby, quien es conocido por sus alocadas y legendarias fiestas en West Egg. Está narrado de una manera exquisita que te atrae, y que a mí en lo personal me enamoró. Y está lleno de metáforas que encontrarás si lees detenidamente. El egoísmo y la frivolidad son características que destacan entre los personajes, pero en lo particular me ha parecido que Daisy además de eso, era una dama que lo tenía todo, y aún así lo que buscaba era sentirse amada, lo que le pasa a la mayoría de los personajes, su único anhelo es sentirse amados, valorados. Pero el egoísmo los consume. Por otra parte, me llamó mucho la atención la manera de pensar de Gatsby. Algo descomunal pero a la vez tan fascinante. El final es un poco triste, pero a mi parecer le ha quedado muy bien a el autor. Es el primer libro que leo de él, y planeo leer más de sus obras. Indudablemente este libro se ha sumado a mis favoritos. Y espero con ansias poder ver su adaptación cinematográfica que será estrenada este verano, la cual será protagonizada por Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobet Maguire y Carey Mulligan. -lo que me aumenta mis ganas de verla- "
2238,yossra khardani,"when I first read the book two years ago I didn't like it, yet this time it's much different. Jay Gatsby was as many; the victime of an elusive dream."
2239,Luana,"Titolo:  Il Grande Gastby Sottotitolo:  Quando uno scrittore sa scrivere anche gli aspetti più ordinari della vita, scritti da lui, assumono il carattere della più completa fascinazione Leggo 'Il grande Gastby' a 20 anni, Fitzgerald l'ha scritto a 29, in pratica io e l'autore abbiamo solo 9 anni di differenza, eppure in questo quasi trentenne c'è una consapevolezza della vita, una riflessione così fondamentale che me lo rende ancora più distante, che mi atterrisce e allo stesso tempo mi magnifica. Fitzgerald è uno di quegli autori a cui è stato fatto dono, o che si sono conquistati - mi piace di più pensarla così - la capacità di rendere stra-ordinario ciò che è banalmente ordinario. Di arrivisti, di ricchi, di spregiudicati, di opportunismo ed ipocrisia non si sentiva parlare sono negli Anni Ruggenti, se ne sente parlare, li si può quasi toccare anche oggi, nel 2011, in Italia, lontani dall'America per terra e tempo. Eppure, attraverso il prisma Fitzgerald si leggono nuove prospettive, si sente il senso tragico di vivere una vita ad un gradino più su di quella che ci si può permettere. Le feste, la gente, la paura del silenzio, il senso opprimente del vuoto che si traduce in continuo bisogno di pieno, pieno e strapieno che cercano di colmare una vita di povertà, una vita in continua scalata in cui non basta impugnare una Montblanc per scrivere un nome diverso da quello vero che il destino ha affibbiato. La forza pungente di un amore per bene che trafigge un ragazzino 'per male', povero e malvestito e che conduce il per male a trasferirsi nel mondo del per bene senza nemmeno sapere se davvero, la nuova vita tanto anelata, ha lo stesso gusto delle case dei ricchi o se invece ha il sapore della solitudine e del grigio di New York. I pregiudizi e le radici, i due mostri sacri dai quali non si può sfuggire nemmeno quando si vive nella più totale sventatezza e nemmeno se si indossa una camicia di seta invece che gli abiti rozzi del contadino; il marito che tradisce non vuol essere un marito tradito, una donna frivola arriverà al 'punto di' ma non si muoverà verso l'oltre, mai, sopratutto se i soldi le han fatto da compagni di vita, quella donna preferirà i soldi all'amore. E poi Gatsby...Pochi sono gli scrittori che ci hanno restituito attraverso silenzi, confessioni late, frammenti di verità ritratti così belli di un personaggio così intenso che mosso dall'amore arriva ai soldi e che dai soldi viene tradito perché i soldi non comprano le persone, sopratutto quelle che già li hanno. Nick Carraway, il narratore, che alla fine di questo episodio ha capito che è meglio tenersi le proprie radici che andare a scavare in una terra fertile all'apparenza, ma arida sino al midollo, che ha capito che Jordan Baker appartiene a quel mondo di cui lui non riesce e non vuole divenire facente parte, unico personaggio che si salva dalla frenesia del Jazz e dalla corsa all'opulenza.Un ritratto dell'America come un ritratto dell'umanità all'insegna della capacità di uno scrittore che sa inserire la parola 'pane' in una frase d'amore e farne comunque la frase d'amore più romantica mai scritta. A Tom e Daisy, che si preservino nei loro pregiudizi, nelle loro finte infelicità, io mi getto anima e cuore a seguire l'insegnamento che Nick, vero amico e vera persona, mi ha dato."
2240,Kristina,"When I first read The Great Gatsby, I was in my Sophomore year of high school. The novel was one of the only required readings in the duration of my high school career that I didn't find particularly boring. Still, I didn't completely grasp the meaning, or implication, of many of the events in the book until seeing Baz Luhrmann's 2013 adaption starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan.Upon re-reading, I realized what I like so much about the novel is the characters. All of them, even Tom, garnered my sympathy at one point or another. Nick, whom I found flat and somewhat dull during my first read through, I now realize is my favorite character. Not only is he tolerant and open-minded of everything transpiring around him, I also felt for him in the fact that he must have been distraught over keeping so many secrets (first Tom and Myrtle's affair, then Daisy and Gatsby's affair, and then the true nature of Gatsby's past when it was revealed to him). And he was still able to keep a good head about it all, though was prone to fits of annoyance, just as all normal people are, as evidenced when he tells Jordan Baker off near the end of the novel.Gatsby earned my sympathy in one of the simplest ways; he loved a woman so fervently that with everything he did, he had her in mind. Of course, I believe he put her up on such a high pedestal that nothing Daisy could do could ever live up to his previous expectations of her, but the way in which Gatsby loved Daisy is, I think, the way everyone in this world wants to be loved. And for him to take the blame for many events in the book that weren't his fault to the bitter end is the bravest thing any one man can do.I think Daisy loved Gatsby as much as a superficial, effervescent young woman can love anyone. I've known a few readers of the book have felt annoyance and outright animosity toward Daisy, but the fact that she couldn't tell Tom she never loved him and run off with Gatsby just shows that she was afraid. Perhaps afraid of what Tom might do, or afraid of what people would think. And this makes her more human, as everyone feels fear in their day to day lives.Tom I felt less sympathy for, surely, but it was still there. Maybe it's just because I'm a forgiving person, but when he promised to take better care of Daisy, despite his affair with Myrtle, I felt for him. However, this could have meant that after Myrtle's death, he would have felt nothing and simply forgotten about her, but he even cried and obviously felt responsible for the incident so he's not without a conscience completely.Jordan Baker, George Wilson, and Myrtle Wilson also had my sympathy at various times throughout the book and I'm just disappointed that it took a great adaptation of the novel for me to really see the great truth in it because it is one of the best books I've ever had the pleasure of reading."
2241,Tazriana Lodhi,"'But no one knows the woman's name, and no one cares' this book really hit me there..describing human nature in the most real way. This was truly an amazing book!"
2242,Golu,"I am not a fan of ""great literature"" since I believe that it is generally slow and long and boring !The reason I picked up the Great Gatsby was that it was the American Novel of the Century - that ought to be an interesting read, and as importantly because it appeared shorter than most classics!Of course, I managed to get an Audiobook that I really enjoyed listening to in my car.This book has singlehandedly changed my mind about old classics. The beautiful flowery language, the very interesting description of characters in the 1930s, upper class social structure critique, and the flawed yet handsome hero (Gatsby), all come together so beautifully (yet tragically) in this short tale, that it is really a marvel.One of my lifetime faovrites, I wonder if the other books by this author are as much fun?"
2243,Grant Schuchter,"Throughout The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald develops extremely interesting characters and disillusions the reader about how said characters aren't as great as they appear to be. Specifically, the ""Great"" Gatsby is revealed to be somewhat of a selfish individual that not only loves Daisy, but also loves to hurt her husband Tom. On a deeper level, Fitzgerald perfectly describes the Gilded Age and its effect on society. For example, Nick Carraway, who was off fighting the ""Great War,"" wasn't able to attend Daisy's wedding. In short, this book showed me that people aren't always as great as they appear to be, the world is filled with imperfections, and that bad things happen to good people."
2244,Jessa,"It's official. After all the many books I've read, this is my favorite among all of them. Master of The Game by Sidney Sheldon used to be my favorite, and trust me, you have no idea how much I  loved and adored  that book.So I'm gonna start with I'm still 14 and my English Class is still on discussion with books like Animal Farm and Little Prince. And I wasn't forced to read this book because of any bloody English Assignment or the like. I've read this on my own free will because I was interested when a lot of people said that it was a great book.I've never read a book before that challenged me to understand every mysterious sentences there are. This was so thought provoking.This book was sad and great at the same time. The connections between all the events that happened to Gatsby were so heart breaking. I was really sad about Gatsby's burial. I kept on remembering a quote from The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky which was ""We accept the love we think we deserve.""This was the kind of book that makes you change your perspective about true friendship and establishing real relationships with people.I've read a lot of childish comments about this book like, ""read it bcoz of english class. hated it lol."" and ""this is boring shit!""And I was always like ""Hey, you stupid piece of shit. You don't go judging a book because you read it half-heartedly (or with no heart at all) just because it was a requirement for you to read it! This is a great piece of literature and before you go bullshitting about it, you go read it properly and analyze carefully every single meaning between what the characters did in this book! Now, you're still gonna talk?!""Okay this was childish of me to post these childish thoughts in a book  review.  (Apologies.) But I just think that this book deserves justice."
2245,Judy Lee,"Most people would say that 'The Great Gatsby' is an awfully boring book, but to be honest, I think it is the masterpiece of masterpieces, a book that can turn all books into steam. PLOTAs you might have expected, the story follows Mr.Gatsby, Jay Gatsby, but is written in Nicholas (Nick) Carraway's point of view, and is based in 1922, America. There is quite a lot of character development, as expected in most fiction stories, and its a love story, to those who didn't know (yes, I know, I know, it doesn't seem like one). *Spoilers* What I don't understand is how someone could leave a person that's loved you, since forever *End of Spoiler* CHARACTERIZATIONThe characters in 'The Great Gatsby' are really well written, including the minor characters. F.Scott Fitzgerald really knows how to paint pictures in your brain, and bring these characters to life. His characters are easy to relate to, and you can easily feel a connection with these characters, despite how short it is. In the end, I still felt that I knew and understood Nick and Gatsby better than most. They were easier to relate to, because of how in depth their characters were written. WRITINGF.Scott Fitzgerald is a genius! How he was able to visualize every moment of this book, I don't know, but he was able to make this book become a book filled with pictures. The description and detail to everything was defiantly what divides this book from other books, a true miracle. Words alone can't describe how much I loved this book (despite the ending)!*Warning: there are some inappropriate language in the book, may not be suitable for young children*EMOTIONAL IMPACTAs I have said before, this book is so- so - well written, it brought the story to life and made every scene seem realistic. In other words, it was a roller-coaster ride of emotions. You could feel everything the characters were feeling, from hate, anger and jealousy to love, joy and happiness, you could feel it skin deep.OVERALLNo language ever known to mankind could describe the beauty I saw in this book. It is a true masterpiece and I would recommend this book to anyone who would love reading a good book (because good books and good authors are pretty hard to find). PLOT: 4.5/5CHARACTERIZATION: 5/5WRITING: 5/5EMOTIONAL IMPACT: 4.5/5OVERALL: 5/5 If I get the chance, I would defiantly re-read this book :) I just watched the movie (16/5/13) and the movie was fantastic, but I still think that the book is better!"
2246,Jesse,"It sure has taken me long enough. I mean, the book is what, not even 200 pages longs and it has been burning a hole in my shelf all this danged-ly long time. Well, I am happy to report that I have finally picked up this classic and have taken the laborious task of trudging through its pages upon myself. Am I a better man for it? Well, at least I know how it ends. No, but seriously folks...Sure, I enjoyed it. Not too shabby, I must say. It was not the life altering experience that I've gather it has been for some (due to the avalanche of acclaim it has received over the years). I was neither in love with it, nor hated it. In fact, I was no where close to hating it. I rather enjoyed myself. It was... fun. Yes, fun. I can use the word ""fun"" when speaking about a timeless classic such as this book. It is perfectly appropriate description of my enjoyment of the story. Fun.While reading the book, from quite an early point, I could see the characters only in the likeness of Orsen Welles and Joseph Cotton. However, perhaps not from the likes of Citizen Kane, which would be the most obvious association. No, as for my understanding of the characters, I though it was much more fitting to dream of them much more along the lines of The Third Man, with Welles's Harry Lime in the role of Gatsby, and Cotton’s Holly Martins as Nick. In fact, this association was so strong that I could hardly think of anything else as I was reading it. And upon the revelation of Jay Gatsby's employment, as it were, the connection seemed absolutely on the nose.Without trying to repeat myself, I shall sum up my enjoyment of the book by saying it was a very good and concise read. Not over long as a good many books prove to be, and not underwritten, as some stories perhaps could be. Each page did its job and although I may not be the better for it, I am a tad more content."
2247,Natalia Cc,"Posee un bella narrativa de hechos cotidianos y simples, ilustra lo peligroso de seguir obstinadamente a una idea que perteneció al pasado o lo erróneo de no cuestionarse la admiración ciega. Dibuja y revela la sociedad de la época post Primera Guerra Mundial."
2248,Ryl,"I finished re-reading this, miles ahead of the March book club meeting. In fact, I only got this copy at the Feb book club meeting which was Monday night, so I must have started it Tuesday, and I finished it last night (Thursday). I don't usually think of Fitzgerald as a quick read, but in this case it was. On the one hand you don't want to read something like this too quickly, because it deserves some concentration, but on the other hand I didn't want to take too long with it because I believe that sometimes the experience of certain books really suffers when you break up the ""flow"" too much. I believe that's particularly true of this one.What intelligent comment can anyone possibly make about The Great Gatsby at this point? Surely everything has been said before. I will say that I was certainly too young the first time I read it. I can't remember when it was but I was probably in college, so very early twenties at the latest. I think I knew nothing about New York when I first read it, also. I think that knowing a bit about New York helped with my experience with it, but also knowing a bit about marriage helped, as well. And of course, a bit more about people, a bit about dreams, a bit about disappointment. The first time around, I remember finishing it and thinking, I must be missing something, what's the fuss about? I didn't really get it. This time, though, I really, really enjoyed it.Now I'm wondering if I should give ""Tender Is The Night"" another go."

2253,lanalang,Mi sono innamorata di Gatsby! :)
2254,Ally,"The Great Gatsby in an amazing book! It took place during the prohibition era, which was an important time in our history. The prohibition added greatly to the plot. All of Gatsby's money comes from an 'unknown' source. later in the book, we find out that tis 'unknown' source is really the sale of illegal alcohol. Gatsby and his friend Wolfsheim buy many drug stores and then illegally sell alcohol. In the 1920's drug stores were allowed alcohol incase they needed to prescribe it to a patient. Because of this this many people abused this opportunity. Gatsby had been giving alcohol to some very important people (commissioner, mayor, etc.) These people gave Gatsby favors and other things in return for alcohol."
2255,Zhi Xin Lee,"
I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a house -- the wrong house. But no one knows the woman's name, and no one cares.
Re-read it after 7 or 8 years, and since I completely do not remember anything from the first read, this was like a new read for me. There was such a flow to the prose, such mood, such lushness -- the twenties in New York have always held such an allure in the way it has been described: the glamour and splendour of it all, and underneath, the vacuousness. The Age of Innocence and The Custom of the Country both twirl around in that sort of an atmosphere as well, and are both books I enjoyed immensely.The book sped towards its conclusion, and what a breathtaking tie-up it was -- this is the kind of book which will leave you with that feeling at the end of a rapid walk past a travelator, the feeling that your body hasn't quite caught up with the rest of you yet. "
2256,Little Pigo,"Potrei facilmente definire questo libro un piccolo capolavoro. Fitzgerald crea un ritratto affascinante della società mondana degli anni Venti, dedita agli eccessi e allo sfarzo.In questo particolare contesto fa la sua comparsa il milionario Jay Gatsby, che pur non essendo il protagonista del libro (a raccontare la storia è Nick Carraway), è senza dubbio il personaggio più importante. Percepiamo la sua presenza ancor prima di incontrarlo, nelle parole del suo vicino di casa, come nelle dicerie di chi frequenta la sua casa.Fitzgerald è stato davvero abile a creare l'attesa: più leggi di questo misterioso gentiluomo, più vuoi saperne.Sempre attraverso gli occhi e la voce di Nick conosciamo la famiglia Buchanan, con Tom, che vive nella vanagloria e nel ricordo dei suoi passati successi, e colleziona più di un'amante, e Daisy, sua moglie, che cerca nei passatempi frivoli un modo per dimenticare le continue scappatelle del marito.In questo matrimonio alla deriva Gatsby giocherà un ruolo importante, offrendo a Daisy una scelta: la possibilità di una vita diversa, più vera e probabilmente più felice, o la sicurezza di una vita fatta di continue apparenze da salvaguardare.Questo conflitto è il filo conduttore di tutto il libro: se Tom, Daisy e tutti gli altri habitué di quel mondo sfavillante, rappresentano la corruzione in un mondo ormai privo di valori, Gatsby è invece la purezza, colui che farebbe e sacrificherebbe di tutto per la donna che ama. Lui è il sognatore che non perde mai la speranza, che ha la forza di volontà di pianificare la sua intera esistenza pur di raggiungere un obiettivo.Tra tutti è sicuramente il personaggio più ammirevole, e i passi che lo riguardano sono i più emozionanti. Più infatti andiamo avanti con la lettura, più scopriamo le sue debolezze, più ci affezioniamo a lui.Anche Nick cambia nel corso della narrazione, e ancora di più cambia il suo punto di vista sul mondo che lo circonda. Quando capisce che il marcio ha lì radici troppo profonde, capisce anche che è ora di andare.Se Tom è indifendibile (oltre che insopportabile), Daisy rappresenta il personaggio più complesso. Si sente in trappola e trova nel suo vecchio amore una via di fuga. Con Jay riscopre la felicità e la spensieratezza che avevano connotato i primi anni del suo matrimonio con Tom. Ma nonostante tutto non trova la forza di andare fin in fondo, rinunciando alla stabilità di una vita agiata e di una famiglia, che nel bene e nel male, ormai esiste. Nel descrivere Daisy, Fitzgerald non è molto chiaro: lei dice di amare Gatsby ma, quando è il caso di farlo, non lo dimostra. A mio parere lei l'ha davvero amato un tempo, ma alla fine ciò che vede in lui è solo un uomo che la ama profondamente e che le offre una via di fuga dalla sua triste vita. D'altra parte il passato non si può cancellare, ormai ha un marito per cui, nonostante gli sbagli e i continui tradimenti, continua a provare affetto, e un tenore di vita a cui non intende rinunciare.Tuttavia l'unico amore vero, incondizionato, che non si pone limiti è quello di Gatsby. Per quanto Daisy creda di amare entrambi gli uomini, il sentimento che lei prova non è minimamente paragonabile a quello di Jay. Pare quasi che lei e tutti gli altri siano diventati incapaci di provare davvero affetto o empatia. Difatti tutto quello che fanno è pensare al loro tornaconto.Nick è il tramite tra questi due mondi, fino a quando non capisce da che parte schierarsi.Tralasciando l'analisi dei personaggi, che l'autore è riuscito a rendere in maniera brillante, altra cosa che mi ha colpito molto sono le descrizioni, così ricche di particolari da rendere agevole per il lettore qualsiasi sforzo di immaginazione. Sfogliare ogni pagina è come fare una collezione di foto, di sensazioni ed emozioni. Fitzgerald ritrae un mondo attraente e crudele e ti ci porta dentro. Senza dirlo esplicitamente, ti fa capire come dietro quell'apparente benessere si nasconda in realtà un meccanismo torbido in cui tutti si servono degli altri, per gettarli via quando non ne hanno più bisogno.Tutti, eccetto Gatsby."
2257,Maddy,"This fantastic love story takes place in 1920's New York and follows narrator Nick Carraway's experience with his millionaire neighbor Jay Gatsby. Five years before the story begins, Gatsby falls in love with Nick's cousin Daisy Buchanan but while Gatsby is overseas Daisy marries Tom Buchanan who is very rich but overpowering and rude. Gatsby tries to rekindle an old spark with Daisy five years later. While Fitzgerald amazingly portrays the 1920's, his unique style of writing, way with words, and the ability to connect me to characters, he simply stole my heart with one novel. I would recommend this book to everyone and it is my favorite book of all time. "
2258,Dess,"“Who is he?” I demanded “Do you know?” “He’s just a man named Gatsby.”Last summer, my father offered me a book bag. Unfolding it, I saw a pair of sad yellow eyes staring at me, a mystical creature, a femme fatale, a burning city with great melancholy. Printed with big white letters was the name Gatsby. The Great Gatsby. The Great American novel. So they say. But when I read Gatsby, it’s not America(understand USA) that I see, that I feel, that I experience. But a story of human condition, of weakness and delusion, of greed and grieve, of stupidity and sorrow. There’s surely a picture of that so called ‘American dream’, or of its birth more likely. But I would prefer to go beyond that etiquette and explore Gatsby’s world. So let’s push the gates ant step in. We have to meet Gatsby. Gatsby is just a man. He’s in his core no different from any other human being. He’s simply mortal. He has this awful dream about a girl, a dream that drives him through life that gives him sense about what he is and what he’s doing. Without it, nothing of what he has gained does matter. He sees his dream every night through a green light…""I'm the Sheik of Araby,Your love belongs to me. At night when you're are asleep, Into your tent I'll creep----""And he creeps, slowly but surely till the moment he finally meets that girl again. And at that moment everything falls apart. The dream disappears, as does Gatsby like a shiny fat soap bubble. It’s a story about how we, as human beings, make sense of life, how we answer the question ‘why we live’ and ‘what’s everything about’. But practically, life has no meaning, no big one, but our own. And Gatsby is doomed from the beginning till the end to see the nonexistence of this life meaning. And that’s only right because Gatsby does not exist either. He’s part of the dream. He’s a lost boy’s sad delusion. And no one comes to the funeral of a mirage.As we step forward, we hear a little voice…“I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope she'll be a fool--that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool."" I think Daisy describes herself beautifully. Because, it’s what she is. A fool. Daisy sees no meaning in her life. She does not think. And precisely because she doesn’t think and doesn’t know what she wants, she is governed by the desires of others, by their little games and dreams. I thought Daisy to be the weakest of them all.But then, we must step aside. There’s a crowd to let in. A crowd of empty people.“Once there they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with amusement parks.” There are Tom, Myrtle and Jordan. Another bunch of shallow fools Fitzgerald gives us to play with. They have no significant role in the book outside of being fools. They are of no use at all, but to witness the downfall of a dream and to rejoice at its death. And finally we meet the honest almost chevaleresque Nick. He says about himself to be in and out at the same time. And he is right. He’s in the story but has no real part of it. He plays no role of how the destiny of the others will turn out. He observes them, describes them and makes no judgment. ""Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,"" he told me, ""just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."" There are few book openings that fit for me so perfectly with a feeling how a hero should be. Nick is like Dante who leads us through Hell and offers us all kinds of sins and sinners. But he has the cardinal virtue of honesty and there’s no place for him between them. He just can’t fit it.Every good book is like a zoo offering some of the finest human specimen. Every great book is like a mirror fill with smoke which reveals at the end our own picture. Of us, humans. Gatsby deserves to be read just for that if it’s not for the delicious prose of his author. I made an attempt to read the book in French (due to my French residence) but gave it up. Unfortunately Fitzgerald is one of those authors whose prose is untranslatable. The beauty, the sadness and the melancholy, one translated, are lost. So I picked up the one staring at me all the time from my book bag. And I must say it. Read it in English or do not read it all. Otherwise, there’s no use of reading it. Finally, reading Fitzgerald reminded me of reading Kerouac. There’s something of the way Sal sees and describes the world that reminded me of Nick. There was that same feeling of melancholy, of asking why, why we are here, of thinking over and over “You can't live forever, you can't live forever."""

2260,Chyna:d,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is simply a classic. It is a good thing they make almost all high school required to read this book because everyone should. Not only does this novel have memorable characters and a great plot but it is set in the era of fame and fortune. The roaring twenties just as it is coming alive. There are many themes Fitzgerald portrays in this book. Society, class, true love, and most of all the love for money is what stands out. There are many different backgrounds each character has and one thing at the beginning of the book that stands out for one of the major themes is when Nick Carraway states what his dad had told him and it always stuck. ""Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,"" he told me, ""just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."" It really developed the character of Nick. There were many characters that simply describes the ""roaring twenties"" Daisy Buchanan is very young but she is not a fool. Well maybe a little. She knows that her husband Tom Buchanan is having an affair but she doesn't do anything about it. I think that in the end she just really wants the wealth and class status that she has so she will keep on pretending that she is happy to get things. Jay Gatsby is the big character and really makes this book special. He is the true ""American Dreamer."" He somehow always found a way to get what he wanted, illegal or not, except Daisy. Which is ironic because once he met her he had to do everything in his power to get her and never did. I really like how this book just fits into the 1920's, probably Americas most interesting and classic time. Although the wealth and class only last about 10 years it really made an impact on everything. The way people dressed, independence, finding ways to make money (even if it was illegal), and overall just the excitement of a new era. This book really explains and goes into depth with this time. I gave this book 5 stars because it is so original and you will never find another classic like this. I even took into consideration with my view on certain things because of this book. I recommend it to pretty much everyone. If they have only seen the movie then they need to pick up the book right away. The movie does no justice to how truly great the story of the roaring twenties and the lives of 6 crazy characters are. "
2261,Deborah,"I decided to reread this novel after many years in preparation for the upcoming film with Leonardo diCaprio. I was apprehensive at first, because Gatsby was my favorite book in high school. I wondered if it would live up to my memory of it. The beginning is a bit slow and it's a classic, after all, not a page turner. But I needn't have worried. It really is as good as people say it is. I don't know how well it will translate into a movie since the greatness of this book lies in the perfect prose, not the plot. Fitzgerald certainly could write. If I have one criticism, it's how many times, he used the word ""jaunty"" to describe Jordan Baker. I mean, dude, you made your point. Also, this is probably just me, but I couldn't help wondering what became of Myrtle's puppy. For a book that was written in 1925, I was surprised at how relevant it still is. The myth of the American dream, that anyone can be successful if he/she works hard enough. And the reality, which is that hard work will only get you so far. Gatsby's connections were pretty shady, but he was far from the only unscrupulous character in the book. I found it interesting that Jordan Baker, athlete and role model, apparently cheated to get where she was. Nick's fascination with the Buchanans, who inherited their wealth and probably never worked a day in their lives, was no different with the American fascination with the lifestyles of the rich and famous. Then there's the whole theme of how you can reinvent yourself. From dirt poor Jimmy Gatz to fabulously weathy Jay Gatsby, anyone can become part of the melting pot, right? Except you can't. No matter how many shirts you own, you can never escape who you are, like the boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past. (Best last line of a novel. Ever). "
2262,Marie,"Love, love, LOVE!!"
2263,Dustin,"A lot of people mention the portrayal of the American dream in this book and I get that but that wasn't what stood out to me the most. There were two things, mainly, that I found compelling.One was Gatsby's fierce clinging to a past moment in his life and his desparate attempt to get back to it. He was willing to do anything that he thought would help him achieve it (namely all the criminal activity that it took for him to become wealthy). He meets his end virtually friendless due to his single minded refusal to move forward.The other was Nick's perusal into the life of decadence of the rich. The rich and famous are often portrayed today (I don't know any personally to know if this is accurate or not) as shallow and selfish and that is exactly how Tom and Daisy behave. Nick is tempted by this lifestyle but at last realizes he's ""grown up"" past that kind of behavior."
2264,Darryn Imoto,"The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald tells the harrowing tale of Nick Carraway, a recent World War 1 veteran and Yale graduate, and Jay Gatsby, a mysterious young millionaire. Fitzgerald uses elegant prose to articulate this picturesque tale of two men in the 1920’s. Nick Carraway moves to New York by way of Chicago in 1922, he rents out a modest but charming craftsman on the coast of West Egg in New York’s Long Island. Nick learns that Gatsby hosts lavish parties at the Gatsby mansion, Nick is invited to one party and befriends Jay Gatsby. Jay Gatsby takes Nick on many adventures through the exciting and bustling metropolis that is New York City. As the plot develops relationships are broken and there is drama between all the characters. This novel really used the setting as an appealing factor. The story is told in the booming 1920’s in the Jazz age in the big city of New York. This novel taught me that all the riches in the world cannot buy love or happiness. Fitzgerald had amazing word choice and really took me to a different era, an era of class and luxury. By reading this book, you can feel the effort and care in each sentence, using imagery and foreshadowing frequently. This novel is truly an American classic and definitely should be read more than once so you can truly appreciate the elements of conflict and forbidden love. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in reading a historic novel and has an appreciation for details."
2265,Hanna,I can't seem to find any reason to rate this book any less than 5 stars. It's a wonderful read! Nick Carraway's narration throughout the whole story captivated me just as he was mesmerised by the whole idea of this man who calls himself Jay Gatsby.Gatsby is a tragic character and I'm very upset because Daisy did not show up for his funeral as if she had not known him at all. Only Nick stayed faithful as a friend to Gatsby until the end.
2266,Jeri Collins," I re-read this (from high school) for my book club. Good choice considering the recent release of the movie (which by the way I loved). This book is so much better than I remember it in high school. The writing is so great. I had to look up a lot of words and references throughout, which is interesting. For example, I had no idea who ""Trimalchio"" was and why comparing Gatsby to this person made sense. I thought several of the sayings from the characters were interesting. There is, of couse, Daisy's statement that she hopes her daughter is a fool. ""...That's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool."". Then, there is Nick's statement that: ""Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you can never blame deeply."" What strong statements about the role of women at the time! Really? A fool and dishonest? Has society's view truly changed since then? The most interesting take away from this reading was how differently I felt about Daisy. My 15-year old self completely missed how complicit she was in the events & how she betrayed Gatsby in the end. All I remember from high school was that the green light was symbolic of Gatsby's yearning for Daisy and her world. And, of course, the billboard of the Doctor's eyes.Excellent book - Take the time to re-read and enjoy it!"
2267,Karin Hwang,"After re-watching The Great Gatsby and having become obsessed with Lana Del Rey's song called Young and Beautiful, I finally decided to pick up two copies of The Great Gatsby which had been gathering dust on my bookshelf for about 3 years. I first read it in Japanese translated by Nozaki Takashi and really wasn't much into the story. Hence, I ended up giving it 3 out of 5 stars. And then I picked up the original written by famous F, Scott Fitzgerald. This time I could say I loved The Great Gatsby.I don't have much to write about it. Fitzgerald did a fantastic job and it's a truly great book. Daisy was just a fantacy to Gatsby yet he deeply loved her.""You're worth the whole damn bunch put together.""""I'll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don't worry. Just trust me and I'll get somebody for you.""Let me say this: Daisy was the biggest bitch. He first dated Gatsby and after she found out he was penniless she left him. And then when he got rich she came back to him, cheated on Tom. When she killed Myrtle she again left him, knowing that he would get the blame. Daisy didn't even come to his funeral. WTF.I love this poor little old sport, Gatsby. He loved Daisy and made her his first priority. Everything he did was for her.My heart has been torn apart. This book has left me with way too many mixed feelings. The more I thik about it the more my heart aches. It was tragic and heartbreaking yet truly beautiful."
2268,Mubina,"The Great Gatsby was one if the best books I have ever read. This book takes place in Long Island 1922. They called it the crazy years in history and that's what it was for Gatsby. The book is told by Nick, Gatsbys closest friend and neighbor. Gatsby was a secretive man, his house enormous, his parties fabulous, but how did he get all of this money? The book is sad, beautiful, intense, and makes you wonder.This book is also a love story between Daisy and Gatsby. This love story is long, but sad. Daisy is a confused, happy, and intense girl. Gatsby has been i love with her all of her life, but Tom MIT be a little bit of trouble. Tom is Daisys husband. This causes conflict. All of his greatness is for love. This book is incredible and people should read it."
2269,Katarina Bukowski,"A great novel. Better educated than Hemingway, he was - on the face of it - a better writer. More colorful. More descriptive. More articulate. And yet . . . despite the magnificent craftsmanship his work is somehow not quite as honest, not quite as ""true"" as old Ernest's. He doesn't let you get as close. He doesn't reveal as much of himself. There is a wonderful letter from Max Perkins at Scribner's that he sent Fitzgerald upon his receipt of the Gatsby manuscript. Well worth reading. Gatsby might be the greatest American novel ever written. If it has an emptiness at its core, if there is not that ""truth"" that we so often find in Hemingway, perhaps it mirrors a similar hollowness at the center of the American psyche as well and is thus fitting. "
2270,Morgan,"This is the second time I have read this book and like it better. I mean I liked the book when I read it in high school, but after I saw the Baz Luhrmann movie I had to reread the book. Now, I'm in love with the whole thing again. The first time I read the book I got OBSESSED with the Jazz Age, but reading it a second time I really fell in love with the writing.The book nails it with descriptions and dialogue. The way the characters talk is so crisp you can almost hear they way they talk as you read the book. Even hearing Gatsby say ""old sport"" over and over just fits his character so well. Color is another huge importance to this book too. This book isn't just black and white, but it's filled with all the colors of the rainbow. Take Daisy's name for instance, she looks pure on the outside, but she's a coward on the inside and supported by money.Most of the book I remembered and not even from the movie. Yes the newer movie follows the book really will, word for word almost, but that's not how I remembered the book. In high school we drew storyboards for each section we had to read and that helped me remember the plot of the book. However, this time around I read this in two days and could have been one day if I was focused. Thank God there's no easy for me to write now.If you are looking to read this book or reread this book, like me, I highly recommend this book in the summer. There really is no other time to read it. It set the mood for a summer afternoon to summer evening perfectly. I can see why this is one of the most important books for Americans to read. There's something very magical about the Great Gatsby."

2274,Garrison Watts,"(Spoilers)I loved this book, I couldn't put it down. I've read this several times over and always get something new. I love Gatsby and Nick, i sometimes feel like I relate to Nick and then other times relate to Gatsby. I decided to read the book before I saw the newest movie and that's when I fell in love. The whole love triangle creates a frustrating cycle that you end up enjoying. A bleak point of view on the roaring 20's generation and how ""vulgar and lazy"" they were. And although it show some of the downsides of life in this time, it makes you enjoy what they did and how wrong people were. A very bleak view on the ""American Dream"" or lack there of. Leaves me wanting more every time I read through it. You hate who you're supposed to hate(Daisy) and you love who you're supposed to love(Gatsby). One of the best written books I've had the lucky chance of reading."
2275,Vanesa Kim," The Great Gatsby's principal figure is not Gatsby but Nick Carraway, a classic narrator, aged 30 in that summer of 1922, a midwesterner educated at Yale alongside Tom Buchanan and Daisy's second cousin. Following his dream, Nick lands next door to a mysterious, party-living man called Jay Gatsby, who uses Nick as a way of re-engaging with Daisy. With the help and support of Nick, Gatsby begins to live and re-start the history of love. The Great Gatsby is a romantic novel about the wealth and habits of New Yorkers during the Jazz Age. The author,Fitzgerald, writes about the Jazz Age in language that beautifully evokes music. He writes about a hot day in a way that almost makes you sweat. His characters are well-drawn, and the plot is engaging and fast-paced.  Personally, the Great Gatsby was my favorite book that I've read during the Summer vacations. Since Fitzgerald did indeed partake in the Jazz Age's decadent high life, it was not surprising that the details of the setting and characters make The Great Gatsby a time capsule of the 1920s. In my opinion, the author described the plot and setting with great details which helped me understand the development of each one of the characters. Gatsby is taught all over the world partly because it's a history lesson and novel all rolled into one delicious wrap of intrigue."
2276,Ruairi,"In my hopeless clamour to read every classic book every, I most recently managed to get around to F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. On the surface a tale of an affair among the rich, the message underneath the novel's pretty standard story is that money can't buy happiness. There is a sad and beautiful portrait of humanity, manners, love, and bullshit in the book's few pages, and the more I think about it, the more I realise how great a book it really is. Ice it with Fitzgerald's beautiful knack for phrase and you have a hell of a read. Never thrilling, but perennially charming."
2277,Alexandre López calvo,"Mi madriña querida, casi dos meses para leer un libro. Un libro que apenas tiene 100 páginas. Para ser sincero me lo he leído dos veces. La segunda disfrutándolo y todo.No voy a decir mucho sobre el Gran Gatsby que no se haya dicho ya. Este libro es viejo, probado y leído. Es una obra maestra y punto. Fitzgerald es un genio.Ahora bien, ¿por que he tardado tanto en leerlo?Puedes ver el resto de la review en...https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blo..."
2278,Leoni Horton,"How do I even begin to talk about my favourite book of all time? It makes me want to dream, but at the same time makes me think what is the use of dreaming. Everybody has a Green Light, we are all Gatsby. Reaching a little further, wanting a little more. Gatsby tries to move forwards, but can't remove himself from the past. I utterly adore the line 'So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.' This just explains everything to me, as a human race we push forward, want the impossible green light. Are stuck so foolishly in the past and we refuse or can't seem to understand that we need to change. What we want is not what we need, we are obsessed by the green light, believe in it like Gatsby.Another favourite line of mine is 'I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.' when i first read this I was like c'mon Daisy! Thats the worst thing a girl can be, but now I see that Daisy is anything but a fool. She is not the fool she pretends to be, she understands exactly what she is, she holds the power over Gatsby, over Tom. The whole of Gatsby's life has been completely devoted to the hope that maybe she'll show up at one of his parties one day. She understands the role she has to play as a woman, the subordinate. This line however reveals her opinion on gender and power, she simply plays the fool, its not what she is."
2279,Maija,"What can i say about this book, that haven't already been said? Classics are classics, hate them or love them, but one has to be familiar with them. Most of the time critics and literates tend to name this or that book the greatest ever, but us, regular readers, don't really get it. But with this one, i get it. Fitzgeral's style is charming, intelligent and smart, and i'm glad to genuinely say i love this book. No doubt that i'm gonna re-read this many more times. "
2280,Yana,"This book allows you to emerge into the jazz age so well so that you can see the rotten society from the inside. At first we see Gatsby as everything that the main character despises, but ""he turned out alright in the end"".This book is not complicated for comprehending. It is about a man who inspite of his wellness lives only thanks to his dream. It gives him courage and strength to live. A man with a dream can achieve a lot. And Gatsby, the great Gatsby teached us and showed us a lot. Though you can't return past, but always can try...Great book, I'm still impressed by it, I will certainly reread it someday. It became one of my favorite books of all time."
