such a freakin  genius  and the sadest part is  that his  science  literally killed him  if you ve read a lot in Darwin  as I have  you come to understand that as a religious man  his studies seriously conflicted with his beliefs  I hate it when I hear someone say that Darwin says   we come from monkeys   because that is not the case his theory is on EVOLUTION  not monkeys  all he wanted people to understand was adaptation and survival of the fittest is really a simple concept  and daily life  proves just that his theories don t have to impede on your beliefs in God  he was a Christian man  himself  but could still see the science before his very eyes  give it a shot if you are intrigued by species changing  growing  dying  extinction  over time    Dear Carol Thank you for your mail  and of course I remember meeting you on the flight last month  It was a very interesting discussion and I m still thinking about it  The semester has now started here at Creationist U and I am working hard  but I found time to read the book you recommended  And I m glad I did  because it was really a lot better than I thought it would be I guess I was expecting Darwin to be like Richard Dawkins  but he was respectful of religious ideas  And it was great that he liked Paley s Natural Theology so much    he says he almost knew it by heart  We read Paley last year in History of Creation Science  and I also thought it was a terrific book  So I could see Darwin was an open minded person who was prepared to look at both sides of the question  Richard Dawkins could learn a lot from that The way he sets up his argument is smart  He starts off talking about how stockbreeders can improve their breed   well  I m a country boy  and I could see he knew his stuff  This is someone who s spent time down at the farm and understands how country people feel about livestock  And I liked that he d done all that work raising pigeons  Not the kind of scientist who just hangs out at the lab all day  After that  he introduces his Big Idea about the survival of the fittest and he almost made evolution sound sensible  He s a good writer  And then he was honest when he explained all the problems with the theory  He really got me   I was wondering if he was going to mention any of that stuff  and a page later he came out and said just what I was thinking  Nice work  Mr  Darwin  But I did wonder what he was doing  cutting out the ground from under his own feet  He said he could explain things like the eye and how bees could evolve to make honeycombs  but even if he was real good at making his case  I wasn t buying any So by the halfway mark  I figured he was done  but like ol  Dubya used to say  I misunderestimated him   he d saved all his best stuff for last  He had some good shots  I got to admit  he made me think  Why does God put the species that look alike in the same place  Like he says  it is weird how you have a mountain range  and there s one kind of animals and plants on one side  and a different kind on the other side  God s ways are inscrutable to us  but why does He care about those mountains  And the islands  they were even worse  He says if you look at the species on a lot of islands  you don t have any mammals there  except you do have bats  Why  I could see where he was going with this one   the bats could blow in off the mainland and evolve  but other mammals couldn t do that  I admit it  I don t have an answer  except maybe God s testing our faith again  But I can see not everyone will like that  I m still wondering about those bats  Okay Mr  Darwin  I said it already but I ll say it again  you were a smart guy  So how s life at MIT  And I hope you read the book I recommended to you  A Canticle for Leibowitz will show you that faith and science have more in common than you might think Take care Bob  One general law  leading to the advancement of all organic beings  namely  multiply  vary  let the strongest live and the weakest die      Charles Darwin  The Origin of Species It is amazing to think that this mild  scientific book published a little less than 155 years ago caused  and is still causing  such a complete storm  I m surprised at how adapted we have become  or at least the segment of those people on the planet who don t reject Darwin s theory of natural selection as counter to their own idea of the way God makes and shakes  to Darwin s revolutionary idea s   Like with many of the pantheon of scientific geniuses  Copernicus  Galileo  Newton  etc  there was a bit of random chance involved  The ground was ready for Darwin s adapted seed  There were enough scholars and scientists and rationalists around to carry his idea s  hither and his theory thither  So while this book  and Darwin himself  were both stellar examples of scientific restraint  the force and momentum of OftS can t be under appreciated  It was just the right time and right place for a scientific revolution  Darwin and his little book walked by a labour of scientific mouldywarps who happened to find themselves on the chalk cliffs of science  pushed those sterile hybrids off  and never looked back  Evolve bitches  Are you an Evangelical Christian  Or  perhaps you are a student participating in one of nation s modern and progressive science classes  learning about the Origins of Man  but confused by the lack of scientifically observable studies missing from your text books  Fortunately for you  Darwin spent decades of his life documenting the observable changes in various species  hypothesizing about these changes and drawing some interesting conclusions about his life s work   Richard Dawkins  narration of this book is excellent    I enjoyed it immensely  however  without my semester of physical anthropology  the essential points would have required much more mental attention  Dawkins inserts clarifying information throughout the book and while Darwin s writing is wonderfully clear  I think more of Dawkins  notes and updates would have been an enhancement I was surprised to see how diverse Darwin s background research was and how elegantly he wrote  He anticipated counter arguments to his ideas and cleanly  systematically eliminated them  As he concluded each level of his argument  the gaps in his knowledge  due to gaps in scientific progress at the time of his being published  required that he make certain logical leaps and assumptions  These were especially interesting because he was invariably correct  as time has shown Dawkins abridged the book to some degree which makes me leary   I want to know what the author intended the reader to know  And because the subject is still  astoundingly  controversial  abridging anything of this nature will likely invite criticism  My science education left a lot to be desired  I was never taught the Theory of Natural Selection in school but only heard it mentioned when some adults scoffed at it  Thankfully  my natural talents steered me away from a career in Biology or Genetics  so this lack of knowledge didn t affect my career prospects  It just affected my understanding of the world  I learned years later the basics of the theory but this just piqued my interest about reading the actual book  I always have problems with Victorian authors  very long sentences  so the print version gave me some difficulty  If it weren t for Richard Dawkins  excellent narration  I don t know that I could have enjoyed this book as much I m almost shocked that I was able to follow the concepts herein as well as I did  I am amazed that Mr  Darwin could write this book  one of the most important in the history of science and the whole world  in such clear  concise way  that a person with minimal understanding of the topic in general could follow along so well  The concepts are explained logically with tons of examples so the reader is not left dangling wondering what he meant  Not only that  but he also writes beautifully and the prose is sometimes as poetic as it is instructive As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds  and these  if vigorous  branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch  so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life  which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth  and covers the surface with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications From the beginning  I understood this wasn t a book I could listen in one sitting or while doing other things  I took it slowly and that allowed me to think things through  It made me think a lot about our place in the world and how sometimes we think we are above the system when in fact  we are just one creature among millions and not the most important in the grand scheme of nature  if we were to go extinct  the planet will continue merrily along   It made reflect in our attempts to control nature  to see change as a bad thing  and our hubris that we can keep in check a process that has moved relentlessly forward for millions of years Darwin was certainly cognizant that his theory wouldn t be accepted immediately   Any one whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject my theory    But I think he would be surprised by how much discussion there is still going on about the subject  specially given that DNA evidence has already proven he was correct in thinking that every living being sprouted from a single progenitor  mind staggering as it seems  As I already mentioned  Richard Dawkins is the narrator for this audiobook and he did an amazing job   you could tell he s probably read this book a million times and knows it like the back of his hand  His diction was very precise and clear  and his enthusiasm for the subject was contagious  It almost feels like Darwin is the one speaking  Overall  a must read for anybody with an interest in learning how we came into being   O Homem nao veio do macaco   Entre o homem e o macaco ha apenas um antepassado comumA adaptacao e sobrevivencia do mais apto   Aparentemente um conceito simples   Finally re read after decades of good intentions  For a recondite classic it is full of surprises  mostly pleasant  its supposed impenetrability largely confined to parts we already knew were directed at specialists  I admit to slogging through the section on barnacles  for example  But Origins is highly readable  pleasurable even  almost in the way of an Edmund Wilson essay  Darwin proceeds deliberately through the mountain of evidence he collected over twenty years as he constructs a virtually unassailable intellectual structure  Freely recognizing arguments against natural selection  the central thread of the book  he gives his best arguments based on the knowledge of his day while carefully pointing out its limitations  I was not prepared for how well he anticipated later discoveries  Mendel s pioneering work in genetics didn t see publication until the early 20th century yet dovetails almost seamlessly into Origins exposition  as does the Modern Synthesis  If you re interested in any of the broad fields of biology evolution  taxonomy  genetics  The Origin of Species is a must read  If you are a creationist  even in its deceptive guise of intelligent design  you are not intellectually honest if you have not read and honestly come to grips with this book  which gives the lie to the railings of a few misguided Christians and Muslims who seem to think it a product of their devil  Yet  so thoughtful and measured a book makes it clear any devils are in the eye of the beholder   With my brand new shiny degree in geology paleontology  this was the first book I read after commencement  I give it 5 stars for the importance of its text  not for its readability  It took me awhile to drag myself into reading this one  People have always commented that it was so dull and that it was convoluted and hard to follow and I have always believed in evolution and found modern books very accessible on the subject so I thought why bother  Then again I have a thing for classics  and as my list of books on evolution grew I started to chide myself that I still had not even read from Darwin s own hand  So I bent to the grain and pulled it out  This book was nothing like what I expected  Absolutely NOTHING like what I expected  If you read this with an open mind  slowly and take each of his points into consideration you find an absolute flawless logic to his argument  It is well presented and actually I find that compared to many scientific articles it is clearly written for the wider audience  Darwin wants you to get it  He wrote as plainly and carefully as he could  He did not propose his idea half assed or hurriedly  I was floored to find that all of my favorite arguments for evolution came straight from the horses mouth as it were  Darwin got it  He really really got it  He went at it from every angle he could  geological time scales  fossils  birds  plants  animals  interactions  sexual selection  selection on islands  selection in various terrains  He broke it down bit by bit and said  Look guys  I hardly wanted to buy this myself but this is how it is  Just look  See for yourself  Make up your own mind  His methodical manner is hard to shy away from  He did not come up with an idea and let others run with it  He did the research  he talked to people  he took it from all angles and presented it in the clearest manner possible  Yes I have to admit that the writing was a bit dry  but the river of content was overflowing  and the proposal was elegant and clear  What a wonderful contribution  I am honored to have read this work and chide myself yet again for my hesitation   Imagine if you will that this year a scientist came forward with concrete evidence that there is an afterlife which does not involve God and that he wrote a book about it  No doubt we would all run out and buy it  We would be skeptical at first but in view of the extraordinary amount of evidence we would finally have to admit that this is the truth  In the years to come further studies would be made to support this idea to the extent that we would no longer even remember what it was like before this book  We would take this knowledge for granted I have given this example so that whoever is reading this can understand my difficulty in writing about it  It is not my place to review Darwin  frankly there aren t enough stars in the ranking system  We have all been conditioned to take as granted the words of Darwin  And in that respect yes  it was a very difficult and tedious book to read  certainly not one to be picked up for entertainment purposes  But it is a book that has not been out of print for nearly 200 years and that says something  It is also a book that was written in such a language that I  200 years later  was able to read and follow and for that I m grateful  So I will put myself in the shoes of the people who first read it and who up until then thought that we were all put on this earth in a magic way by the Creator  And when I do that I can only bow respectfully to the work and intelligence of this man who in all modesty and knowing the consequences of what he was saying had the courage to change our perception of the world  My favorite quote in relation to this book  and one that I feel serves as a review in and of itself  is   Every educated person owes it to themselves to read The Origin of Species   After reading it  I whole heartedly agree with the statement  Only when one reads Darwin s perspective on such topics as breeding  domestic speciation  migration  instinct  etc  does one come to fully realize how much this book ushered in a new age of modern thought  The Theory of Evolution is so pervasive in the mindset of today s world that only by reading the work can one understand how much of a statement Darwin was making by risking its publication  He very literally changed the world or  rather  told us how it had been changed Within the book Darwin also makes many references to the  beauty  and  wonder  of nature  something that I found quite fascinating considering how many  or at least some  believe his works to be the antithesis of religious ideals  I gained a respect for Darwin s knowledge and love for the natural world that surrounds us  and there is no question that his words caused me to appreciate nature in both a scientific and spiritual sense  As my opening quote demonstrates  you owe it to yourself to read this book  It changed the way mankind viewed the planet  their relationship with it and  indeed  their relationship with their very origins   There is grandeur in this view of life     Darwin s The Origin of Species is the best eye opener for people who want to understand the theory of evolution  With the current paradigm of creationism and its argument against evolution  it is the best book to refer too  Darwin s theory is very strong and realistic and can be easily related to today s universe  I finally did something I ve been meaning to do for a long while  I read  On the Origin of Species   And I m incredibly glad I did  It seems silly to give a  review  of such a book  but I wanted to make a quick note on one thing about it that struck me repeatedly while reading it  I have read lots of books on natural history and evolution  and it s been a topic of fascination to me since I was relatively young  Such books often make a point of defending evolutionary theory from doubters  i e   creationists   Indeed  that often seems their main point  This is so common that I d gotten into the mental habit of assuming such defenses were reactions to new difficulties with the theory  I m a little bit flabbergasted  but in a very pleasant way  to find how very wrong I was  In fact  all of the conventional arguments against evolution by natural selection are answered quite explicitly by Darwin himself I had known this to be the case of the most common argument  the argument from design  but practically every other complaint against the theory I d ever read or heard of is likewise addressed  here in the foundational text  It s really amazing  If you could somehow ignore the 19th century language  as well as Darwin s understandable ignorance of the mechanism of inheritance  DNA   you could almost think this book was written as a contemporary reply to  Intelligent Design  advocates  The bulk of the text  in fact  is made up of Darwin saying  in effect   Here s a potential problem with the theory   and here s why it s wrong      With over 20 years of painstaking experimentation and data collection to back up his argument  There s even this little nugget near the end   Anyone whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject my theory   To see why this is so funny  Google  Dover trial bacterial flagellum  The whole experience has left me feeling more than ever how intellectually bankrupt ID really is  Not only do they continue to advance the same discredited arguments over and over  but their arguments themselves were discredited from the very beginning  Two options remain for such people  and I m talking about the leaders of the ID crowd like Michael Behe  not your run o  the mill fundie  1  They ve never actually read the book  Perhaps I shouldn t be too judgmental either  since I d never read it either  But then I haven t based my career around attacking a theory I don t understand 2  Or  more likely  and cynically   they HAVE read the book and the rest of the canon of modern biological sciences and choose simply to ignore them  largely on the assumption that the hoi polloi will assume the arguments have not been successfully refuted In either case  they are not worth taking seriously by any standard  I can t imagine anything less necessary than writing a capsule review of the Origin of Species  but    it s a really great read  Darwin was unusually reflexive and tempered in his writing  probably owing at least in part to the heavy disapproval he know he would encounter from everyone from the clergy to other scientists  but props to him for writing in a way that is at once confident and humble  Reading this after Feyerabend s Against Method  the major thing I took away from it was that science should always leave itself open to the consideration of new theories  even if those theories contradict the logical systems that presently reign  In the case of Darwin  it is utterly apparent  to me  that Natural Selection is an ethical and valuable creation myth that opens the field of scientific inquiry to an untold number of fresh possibilities  That it was abused by so called social Darwinists and other politically motivated actors only reinforces my feeling that the ethical implications of all scientific theory should be subjected to at least as much rigor as data  methodology  and repeatability Finally  Darwin uses awesome examples of strange animals  Se podemos  devemos  eis o impulso que fez nascer esta obra e o motivo que me levou a querer le la Embora tenha saltado alguns capitulos menos necessarios a uma apreensao geral e satisfatoria  nao tenho duvidas de que me apaixonaria mais por Darwin a cada palavra sua que lesse  Nao so estamos perante um livro que foi responsavel por uma das mais importantes reviravoltas na historia do pensamento cientifico como estamos   e esse e o seu grande merito   perante umas das mais bem sucedidas formas de fazer a ciencia chegar as pessoas  tratando se  com efeito  de uma obra acessivel a qualquer um Nao faz sentido entrar aqui em detalhes acerca da teoria evolucionista proposta por Charles Darwin porquanto esta e hoje largamente conhecida pela generalidade das pessoas  mas nao deixa de ser pertinente reflectir acerca do modo como esta teoria foi recebida ha seculo e meio e como teria sido hoje  epoca em que todo o conhecimento estaria a seu favor  E sobretudo a sua capacidade de previsao  que  de modo geral  e requisito de qualquer teoria cientifica  e a sua ambicao  ainda que revestida de uma genuina humildade  que a tornam tao importante do ponto de vista biologico e progressista  Ler A Origem das Especies e testemunhar  a luz do que sabemos actualmente  ate quao longe pode ir a intelectualidade humana  E e tambem  talvez acima de tudo o resto  uma inesgotavel fonte de prazer  Reviewing a timeless book like this one is no easy task  but after having read it three times I might be able to put something together The Origin of Species is one of my favourite accounts of the theory of evolution  It s not the first piece about the theory ever written as many believe  nor is it compatible with everything we know about evolution today  What makes this book special  however  is the narrative  As Darwin guides the reader through the proposed theory of the origin of living organisms and their gradual development  only one word can come to mind  elegance  Elegance in the ideas  elegance in the delivery  and above all elegance in the acknowledgement that there is so much that is unknown  at his day  One particularly pleasant aspect of the book is the tremendous amount of examples that Darwin provides  Reading the book becomes then like browsing a catalogue of various fauna and flora from all over the world as you slowly begin to understand the basis behind the theory  It s not a book to rush through  nor is it the book that I d recommend for getting acquainted with the subject  for that purpose I recommend The Greatest Show on Earth  The Evidence for Evolution   but it is the book to read if you want to go back and understand how the theory of evolution began to develop and why it is often credited to Darwin  Several aspects of the book surprised and delighted me I didn t expect this to read as a novel  and it was not one  this was a philosophical thesis  and the result of some 30 years of research and contemplation which has not gone to waste As a non native English speaker I expected this to be a upstream struggle in comprehension   it was not  The language is only slightly archaic but overall is surprisingly down to earth once I got used to the style of the narrative The logic and the examples used to support it were clear Charles Darwin did not make his conclusions lightly and had full understanding of controversial nature of his work  but felt it was necessary to express the truth that was revealed to him through his research  It is apparent from this book that he had discussed each and every point of the theory at length  Much with those who were like minded and just as much with those who opposed him  And he relates the counterpoints in this very volume along with his reasons for thinking why these counterpoints are invalid On this what surprised me is that  at least to my knowledge  the biggest opponents of evolutionary theory today  let s call them creationists for simplicity  have not came up with any new counter arguments to it  Everything creationists are saying today against evolutionary theory Darwin has answered already in this very book  Should they only ready it and follow the logic     but I digress In conclusion I should point out that this isn t an entertaining book  and at times it does become tedious  but it s invaluable educational and historic piece that anyone interested in evolution and modern science should  suffer through  at least once  A must read for anyone interested in natural history I ve probably listened to and rated over 15 books about evolution over the last two years  but I was always hesitant to read the granddaddy of them all  I should not have been and am glad I did for the following reasons 1  The book reads as well as any of the good popular science books available on audible  It is written as if his attended audience is for a 13 year old  That s how good of a writer Darwin is 2  I had obtained a google book version  but couldn t bring myself to read it  and I had obtained a free audio version floating around the net  but this audio version is professionally read and doesn t suffer at all from the narrator 3  The book lays out a very complicated argument in 13 basically independent chapters  Each chapter by itself is enough to convince the listener of the fact of evolution by natural selection  The author is very smooth at telling you what he s going to tell you  then tell you  and then explain to you what he has just told you 4  The book is a guidebook on how to lay out an argument and convince others to your viewpoint  He makes sure that he fairly presents criticism that could attack his theory and refutes it masterfully 5  My favorite reason for having read this book is that my smugness index has gone up  When I come across people who haven t read the book and deny the scientific fact of evolution I can now say that I have listened to the book and smugly add statements like  even a thirteen year old can understand evolution  haven t you even read  On the Origin of Species    Every bit as important and ground breaking as every reference out there makes it out to be  And  surprisingly  it s not hard to read at all  Darwin was not a scientist  he was a naturalist  an observer of nature  and that s what makes his work not only commendable but also very approachable  For me  everything he explains about descent through modification and rudimentary organs and common ancestors not only makes sense but is corroborated by the principles of Biology concerning classification and evolution  Darwin  contrary to how creationists reacted and are still reacting towards him  does not confront the idea of  God created everything out of nothing  and dismisses it as nonsense  except maybe a little towards the end  when he writes  Do they really believe that atoms have been commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues     He takes more of a perplexed approach and doesn t seem to understand why they can t look at the facts This man definitely changed the world   A note on the Kindle edition  it seems abridged and it doesn t include a chart that the author refers to several times    Not much to say here except that the book was more accessible and more interesting even today than I expected it to be  I expected to know pretty much everything that Darwin would say from science class  but I did not The book will be tedious for those who don t have analytical scientific minds because each chapter and section are structured to advance the argument that the diversity of species in nature descended from a small set of original progenitors via natural selection  This often involves literally listing out each possible scenario for each argument under discussion and examining each one in turn  or explaining in detail facts which support the arguments he s advancing  but at a minute degree of detail so that no room for interpretations other than his are left All I can say for those who are religiously opposed to the theory of evolution by natural selection is  read the book   If you disagree with evolution  don t do so from ignorance  In some places  Darwin goes far to reconcile his doctrine with religious creationist belief  He gives perhaps the best attempt that I ve read to reconcile evolution to creationist doctrine when he discusses the  perfection  of the eye  and our tendency to compare the eye to the telescope He says  paraphrasing   We tend to believe that the eye could not have been created by degrees because the telescope was invented by design by man  But why should we be so presumptuous as to think that the Creator invents in the same way that man invents his devices   Good point  isn t in possible that God s acts of creation are not similar in nature to man s acts of creation  and that arguing by analogy to man s creative process is too presumptuous A very worthwhile read  In het Nederlands   Over de oorsprong der soorten  Toen enkele jaren geleden een nieuwe vertaling van dit meesterwerk uitkwam heb ik besloten om het te lezen Dit boek is de basis van een van de 3 grootste wetenschappelijke theorieen waarop onze huidige kennis is gebaseerd  Evolutietheorie  relativiteitstheorie en kwantummechanica  Ondanks het feit dat de falsificatie van deze theorie vereist dat men ook de huidige kennis van de geneeskunde  de biologie en de geologie in vraag stelt  zijn er nog altijd mensen op de wereld die deze prachtige inzichten niet willen aanvaarden  Altijd op basis van religie Weinig mensen tegenwoordig hebben dit boek  waar iedereen over leert op school daadwerkelijk gelezen  Het is nochtans een zeer leesbaar  boeiend en toegankelijk boek ondanks het feit dat het een wetenschappelijk basiswerk is Het is vooral opvallend hoe creationisten niet weten welke theorie ze bestrijden  Ze geven als tegenvoorbeeld voor de evolutietheorie het ontstaan van het oog en citeren Darwin met   het is duidelijk dat het ontstaan van een oog door natuurlijke selectie uiterst onwaarschijnlijk lijkt   Maar vergeten de rest te citeren  want Darwin gaat verder met  doch  dit is slechts schijn  en dan wijdt hij een volledig hoofdstuk aan hoe het oog kan geevolueerd zijn Als je dit boek leest kom  ben je onder de indruk van de enorme berg aan bewijsmateriaal die Darwin al verzameld had om zijn theorie te bewijzen  Na zijn inspanning is die berg in de voorbije 150 jaar alleen maar toegenomen en wel tot zo n proporties dat deze theorie een fundament geworden is voor de moderne geneeskunde en biologie  maar ook voor economie  psychologie en sociologie  Arguably the most important book ever written  and it s an easy read  If you ve never read it  DO IT  Darwin makes his case in the introduction  and the rest of the book is EVIDENCE  Tons and tons of EVIDENCE The version we are most familiar with today is the first edition  and that s a good thing  In later editions  Darwin was compelled to alter his theories so drastically  they looked more like Lamarck s work  He did this NOT because of opposition or religious pressure  He did it because  as all good scientists should  he paid close attention to the work of other respected scientists At the time  physicists had not discovered modern atomic theory  or even that atoms EXISTED  They could not come up with a testable theory that established the sun as being more than a few hundred thousand years old  This made Darwin s billion years old Earth unworkable But of course  when quantum physics came along  Darwin was proven right  and his FIRST ideas were shown to be his best  And when DNA was discovered a few decades later  it did all the things he said it would So yeah  READ THIS BOOK I recommend this pocket size hardback edition  It s convenient for travel  and it s beautiful  too http   www abebooks com book search i    OK  its the classic and its old  But it is great in the sense that it allows you to see how Darwin thought  and how far we have come in 150  years  It is a well reasoned argument that stunned the world so many  yet so few  years ago  Writing was Darwin s only way to communicate with the outside world  I wonder how he spoke  what his own defence would be if he had chosen to speak for himself rather than have Huxley speak for him  The outrage the book provoked is best remembered by Bishop Wilberforce s wife s comment concerning evolution    Let us pray that it is not true  but if it is true  let us pray that it not become generally know   Sorry about that  So many people still do not accept evolution as fact  but one must accept the notion that it takes 400 years for knowledge to reach the lowest intellectual levels of society  250 years to go  Darwin s insight is well known but to read the book is to gain something more than just additional detail  it is to have direct contact with the clarity of his mind and expression  The arguments are elegant and assembled precisely such that anyone can read the book  albeit they may gain more with a greater knowledge of species and plants mentioned  but that aside  it does not render the book difficult in anyway  This ought to be on the  must read  lists   Thus  from the war of nature  from famine and death  the most exalted object of which we are capable of conceiving  namely  the production of the higher animals  directly follows  There is grandeur in this view of life  with its several powers  having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one  and that  whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity  from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been  and are being  evolved  Coming to read  On the Origin of Species  initially felt like an intimidating task  I was familiar with it and had gone through most of the well quoted referenced sections in college while taking plenty of anthropology courses in addition to my other reading on the subject but my biggest shock  and delight  was to find how accessible this thing really ends up being  It wasn t the slog through technical jargon that I anticipated but rather a beautiful  vividly written narrative Examining Darwin s evidence and his findings is a real treat but the biggest joy  for me  comes out of seeing how right he really got it  and with so little to go on at the time   It s staggering too to put yourself in the shoes of a typical mid nineteenth century reader or naturalist and to hear these ideas for the first time and to think how game changing it would be Oh  and again    the language  I m going to work on bringing progenitor back into the casual lexicon Recommended  A good version of Darwin s chef d oeuvre  The title settles the scope of this work   The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life   Given the political debate over Darwinian theory  even though the scientific debate has essentially been settled for decades   it is essential for people to at least understand what Darwin actually wrote  As such  this is a valuable resource  This book wasn t written to entertain  but to defend a scientific proposition  It wasn t written in opposition to the Genesis account of creation  which many serious scientists by 1859 had already discarded  Truly there s no point in arguing with proponents of the Biblical account  who are playing by different rules  Really  by no rules at all Theories of evolution had gained a reasonably wide acceptance by the time Darwin published this book  but he was dissatisfied with the lack of any apparent verifiable mechanism for these theories What you see throughout this book is no reference to the concepts of  evolution  or  as it was much more widely known then   transmutation   Instead  he talks constantly of  natural selection   the mechanism for the evolutionary process  For this reason it s apparent that he was arguing not with the church but with the followers of Jean Baptiste Lamarck and other evolutionists His arguments are deep and long  to be sure  and not always captivating  But Darwin anticipates  sets forth  and counters substantial objections to natural selection as the driver of evolution  His work is not only thorough and brilliant but highly rigorous and convincing  What struck me when I read this book was the theory s anticipation of discoveries that were  in certain cases  more than a hundred years in the future  Darwin had no knowledge in 1859 of the function  workings or even existence of chromosomes  genes or DNA  nor even of Gregor Mendel s work on heredity  Darwin was working in the world of the everyday  and drew conclusions  sometimes varying a bit from current thought  but usually profound and far reaching  It s axiomatic to say that it is the foundation of the modern science of biology That the book is not a nail biting page turner is no criticism to me  It s like being disappointed in the Statue of Liberty because it won t float    What should be done if a perfect kangaroo were seen to come out of the womb of a bear  This is just one of the many extraordinary questions that Darwin uses this book to both ask and answer  My version came with extracts from  Voyage of the Beagle  and Darwin s own autobiography  but also quite a few references to animals that I had no idea ever existed  let alone evolved This book is a classic  so I don t need to go into too much detail about why it s incredible  Something to take a note of is that even the introduction was good  I was given a good insight into the time period and scientific context to which Darwin was writing unconventionally The introduction relieved me  too  of my first fear  I worried that this book was going to be full of language very specific to Naturalistic studies  Whilst this kind of terminology and jargon isn t entirely avoided in the book  it is nowhere near a scientific abstract  The book was clearly intended to be read and understood by the general public  This  in my opinion  causes a conflict in the writing  Darwin  who is a genius  is writing down to the general audience  who   let s be honest  the majority of us aren t geniuses  To work around this  Darwin almost over explains some of his ideas  Whilst it can get annoying  it does lend an air of constancy to his ideas   proving they aren t passing thoughts  but are evidence backed statements Darwin said that he wouldn t publish the book until it was perfect  It has since been published innumerable times lktb lmqds ldrwyn ybhrk Hyn tqr h kyf stT  fy  Srh

one of the first printings of this book  This may be the most important factual work ever written  There are books that are arguably more influential  but they do not  by and large  contribute to our understanding of the physical world  There are books with greater factual content which has been less revised in the light of new knowledge  but it is hard to think of one quite as influential  Darwin  after a decades long process of formulation  research and self doubt  with this book both established the theoretical framework that turns natural history into a science and identified humanity s place in that framework  The effect has been profound I must admit  I found Darwin s prose harder to follow than I had expected  Victorian prose tended to circumlocution  and Darwin for this reason was for me less readable than either modern protagonists of scientific theory or the philosophes of the Enlightenment  This was a pity  and detracted somewhat from the pleasure of reading such a profound work  For crystal clarity of explanation I would choose Dawkins  For gravity and historical impact  one has to read Darwin Stylistic niggle aside  it is striking how much Darwin got right at a time of limited knowledge and means  and sometimes even more illuminating what he got wrong  or did not know  The greatest lacuna in his rather encyclopaedic knowledge of nature concerned the rules of variation and development  These are a continuing triumph in science and their effect has been to confirm and complete Darwin s own triumphs  Darwin was not aware of the rules of Mendelian inheritance  He was  therefore  forced to fish in the dark for an understanding of how variation arises and re emerges over generations  The synthesis of this understanding  when it was widely realised  reinforce natural selection and turn it into a true  mathematical  science discipline  Darwin believed in the inheritance of acquired characteristics  We now do not  except in the limited technical sense of epigenetics  but this  along with the plasticity provided by the principles of use and disuse  merely strengthens natural selection When he gets it  right   as defined by our present understanding  Darwin is even stronger  On homology and biogeography his case is simply compelling  He backs up his arguments about the movement of species with case after carefully tested case regarding the survival of seeds in salt water  the presence off shore of flying insects  the movement of eggs and earth on birds  feet and so forth  It has been said that Darwin s unique notoriety in a period when evolution was emerging all around him and was formulated independently by another  Wallace  is due to his discipline and patience in gathering and documenting evidence  I have to agree  He is the quintessential scientist Had Darwin never lived  natural selection would have been known before the end of the Century regardless  We owe to Darwin that it became a true science and that it stood so early on such strong foundations   Finire questo libro equivale per me il raggiungere la vetta dell Everest per uno scalatore  E stato un viaggio lungo e lento  quasi tre mesi     che ha visto ripide salite  pause e discese  Ma che viaggio  gente Charles Darwin mette nero su bianco la sua innovativa e criticata  all epoca  teoria sulle origini delle specie  prendendo in esame tutti i casi a suo favore ma anche quelli che potrebbero metterla in difficolta  Nella versione che ho letto io  la sesta del 1872  risponde singolarmente a tutte le obiezioni che gli sono state poste  E stato pesante leggere i suoi infiniti esempi  su specie di amimali e vegetali che non conosco  mentre e stato piu semplice leggere di colombi  formiche e api    Ma al di la delle difficolta  non si puo non apprezzare un lavoro di simile portata  che ha cambiato la storia della scienza e i cui risultati oggi fanno parte di noi della nostra logica Ci sarebbero tante cose da dire  libri da scrivere e tesi universitarie da fare su questo argomento  E l unica cosa che rimpiango e di non avere una cultura abbastanza ricca da poter mettere in relazione questa opera con il periodo in cui e stata scritta e di poterne cogliere appieno gli effetti immediatamente successivi  ma a questo c e rimedio e sicuramente cerchero di documentarmi a dovere Concludo dicendo se non Darwin  cinque stelle  chi li merita   There is only one other book that is so widely known  discussed  and debated  yet so rarely read  that other book is the Bible  To make my point  here is a little quiz  1  Which name is most closely associated with the theory of evolution   2  Which book did this person write on evolution   3  What claims are made in that book   4  What else is contained in that book   With astonishing regularity  the average literate adult will respond as follows  1  Darwin  2  Origin of Species  3  Humans descended from apes  and 4  I have no idea  The first two are correct  the third is absolutely false  and the fourth is an admission of complete ignorance  Considering that Origin of Species is long  and took nearly two decades to write  one would expect it to contain something more than the four simple words Humans descended from apes  which  in fact  it neither contains nor implies  So  what DOES it contain  There is one word that best summarizes the bulk of Darwins magnum opus  observation   It is a lengthy book  at times it is tedious  at times politically incorrect  and at times scientifically off base  But  despite its numerous flaws  it is one of the greatest achievements in the history of mankind  Even if you are among the few who refuse to accept Darwins ideas  you cannot deny their impact  The theory is the cornerstone  if not the very foundation  of modern biology  Whatever your preconceptions  you will likely be surprised by this work  Darwin was the consummate naturalist and scientist  as well as a refined and articulate gentleman  Origin is a delight and an epiphany to read  Its amazing how much Darwin got right  despite the fact that he had essentially no idea of how inheritance worked  Its amazing how much data Darwin carefully assembled  analyzed  and described  Its amazing how meticulously Darwin weighed the evidence  noting when competing theories made different predictions  when the available evidence was not what he would have expected  and what future evidence could completely discredit  falsify  his theory  Its amazing in its honesty   The misconceptions about Origin of Species are not merely rampant  they are effectively universal  fueled  largely in the US  by the rise of creationism  which seeks first and foremost to vilify the theory of evolution as well as Darwin  often failing to distinguish between the two   Its worth the time to read this enormous but meticulously crafted volume  if only to allow you to form your own opinions about such an influential book  Once you have  take the little quiz again  You may need all the pages to answer the last question   Most Victorian writers have a tendency to make me despair  but that is another argument all together  putting aside my dislike of the period I can say that something strange happens in this book  Yes the theory of evolution is a masterpiece of scientific deduction and logic  and to my mind one of the most profoundly beautiful discoveries in our history  yet what is strange is the man who discovered it  Somehow Charles Darwin the person is in every page of this work  his personality is etched into the DNA of the whole volume  In parts it is intoxicating to read and in other parts quite droll but over all the man writing it is almost touchable in his words  It is also interesting that when I was reading it the process of hind sight played its merry game in my own mind  Its a book so worth reading because all of the pieces of the puzzle fit  Its mentally satisfying to read and like a full meal  Darwin writes it in such a conspiratorial way that I was left with the conviction that I had discovered the theory myself       So do not be afraid of the science behind the words  you will love it or hate it but you have got to read this illuminating and simple book For what its worth I would have given it twenty stars  in fact the only way it could be any better is if the publishers threw in free cakes for all reading it        I have just finished a rereading for the 4th or 5th time and as always I am stunned by the depth and breadth of Darwin s work  A lifetime of gathering facts and analysis succintly set forth in this lttle volume  Probably the most important single work in the history of science I don t believe that anyone can consider themselves to be educated if they have not read this book  Of all the sciences what can be more important than a general understanding of how we got here To remember that the work was rejected by a majority of the literate world when the first edition was published in 1859  is to understand the profound difference between knowing and believing for most humans Fortunately for Darwin no church could put him on trial as had happened to Galileo in 1632 for suggesting that earth was not the center of the universe The fact that current polls show 55  of Americans believe that Darwin s theory is not correct is testament to the continuing difference between knowing and believing  Read once again 12 30 15  I should mention a favorite piece of trivia  the incredible coincidence that two of the greatest humans who have ever lived were born within a few hours of each other  Charles Darwin and Abraham Lincoln  Darwin brought us a revolution that has swept aside mythologyI wish this were required reading for every student in high school  It is the perfect example of reasoned argument based on years of study and experience with the subject  Far from an arm chair theorist  Darwin experimented and traveled constantly  driven by a desire to know That there was such an uproar in response to this work is testimony that our emotions rival  if they do not surpass  our reason Written in a clear style without assuming the reader to be a scientist  Darwin carefully lays out his theory and the objections raised to it  He is cautious and anything but arrogant  as have been so many of his opponents  while making his thinking clear Yet  several of the points of argument against natural selection are maintained to this day  the incomplete fossil record  for example  in spite of the fact that the results of scientific investigation in so many areas have only reinforced Darwin s theory What most impressed me in the book is that Darwin s thinking on the cause of change in life forms through inheritance came so close to the target  since revealed to be contained in the chromosomes  of which he had no knowledge Clear thinking here for all to read  from precocious 12 year olds to octogenarians  but only if their minds are open to reason  Why do we think this theory is superior to others  Simply because it makes sense in light of everything we have been able to discover on the subject of where we  and all life on earth  come from  Since this book is a scientific classic  I assume there is little need to explain what it s about  but just in case you ve spent your entire life in a cave  this book describes a theory of the evolution of life over the long history of this planet  Darwin wrote it in the technical style of the 19th Century  so it s somewhat slow going for a modern reader  Still  to follow the methodical thought process of this brilliant man as he presents the evidence for his revolutionary theory is well worth the investment of time  Most of his work has stood the test of time very well  such as the idea of natural selection  and the observation that unique species will evolve in isolated environments  There are  of course  some things that Darwin just got flat wrong  such as his ideas of how characteristics are transmitted from one generation to the next  Darwin knew nothing of genetics   when he wrote the Origin of Species Gregor Mendel was still doing his famous experiments growing peas in an obscure corner of eastern Europe  It s interesting that Darwin devoted a chapter to the potential flaws in his theory   how many modern authors would do that  But he was a man who was genuinely seeking the truth in a scientific spirit  He presented the drawbacks as he saw them but was confident that they would be overcome  as indeed they were  For example  he cited the lack of fossils of transitional species as a problem for his theory  but he noted too that the geological record of the time was very incomplete  Within a year of publication  the first fossil of Archaeopteryx was found  a clear transition between reptile and bird  Again  the book is not a page turner but it is very thought provoking and I recommend it to anyone   even creationists who will not believe a word of it  Read it anyway  you ought to at least understand what you re claiming is untrue  A teoria de Darwin movimentou o homem da sua posicao ocupada no centro da criacao causando um impacto ate os dias de hoje  O que Darwin dizia era que somente a luta pela sobrevivencia  dando uma grande distancia no tempo  pode produzir o rico e variado mundo que vemos hoje O Darwinismo foi encarado com muito ceticismo Ele viajou por toda America do Sul no Navio Beagle e quando o deixou  com 27 anos  estava c seu caderno cheio de anotacoes sobre as especies  Tinha uma colecao enorme  Em sua colecao de besouros ele juntou 1 500 especies  4 000 peles  ossos  especimes empalhados e muitos fosseis  Ele retornou com 3 000 paginas de notas de entomologia  geologia  paleontologia e zoologia  Era o idolo da comunidade cientifica de Londres Ele fez duas declaracoes importantes  A primeira foi que acreditava que todos os organismos vivos  animais  plantas e tudo mais descendia  de um ou mais organismos simples  Mas esse e o processo simples de descendencia  o processo simples de reproducao biologica  A ideia de evolucao  A segunda coisa era o mecanismo  o processo que faria isso acontecer e que era a sua ideia de selecao natural Ele mudou de forma fundamental e permanente a nossa nocao de natureza  Precisamos de novas vacinas para a gripe todo ano  venenos para insetos pesticida resistentes  Nos encorajamos a evolucao de resistencia aos antibioticos que usamos  o que e irresponsavel  descuidado e estupido de nossa parte Esse livro nos deu o mundo  Ha grandeza nessa visao da vida com os seus poderes originados pelo Criador em varias formas ou em apenas uma  De um comeco tao simples  varias formas lindas e maravilhosas foram criadas e evoluem Como disse Schopenhauer  toda teoria revolucionaria passa por tres estagios  No primeiro  ela e ridicularizada  No segundo  e rejeitada com violencia  No terceiro  e aceita como evidente por si propria Acho que nao e necessario deixar de acreditar em Deus para ser evolucionista  Amazing  The Origin of Species shook the world upon its publication in 1859  and though the theory of evolution is now a fact  some people still deny its existence  I expected this masterpiece by Darwin to be more prose than fact  but it was loaded with so much data  gathered by such a stupendous amount of study and experimentation  that it will make your head spin  I am totally blown away by Darwin s carefully calculated  fact backed argument  I find it so hard to believe that the Bible thumpers still regard this book as heresy  Their stupidity sickens me   Here we have this curious and ingenious guy reporting observations collected during experiments such as  breeding pigeons from different places  watching ants and bees  and much more  He even challenged the intellectual tools of a very very unlikely  Creator   What a practical mind  Amusing that he often writes  we are profoundly ignorant on    More importantly  his ideas are accessible to any curious mind at no cost  open domain   Much to my embarrassment  I have never read this volume from beginning to end  I have only read excerpts or portions as related to a specific set of information  Now that I have completed the entire volume  I am even more disappointed in myself as it is utterly amazing  I have long been in awe of Darwin  but how one person could have covered the enormous amount of information he did and have derived the vast number of conclusions and postulations is mind blowing  His response to criticism is noteworthy  He took each comment separately and either clearly explained his position or noted that the answer was not complete but stated how it would be solved  He stated he was less writing for the scientists of his age as he did not expect to change their thinking but for future generations would not only accept his thinking but fill in the many gaps   Wow  Detailed  Thought provoking  I think I would have to read this many times before fully understanding the entire theory But I was provided enough information to make my own decision with regards to Evolution vs Creationism  In particular Christianity  as this is how i was brought up  I cannot comment about other religions  Charles Darwin  the revolutionary scientific theorists that introduced the theory of evolution to the world  His findings are praised by the scientific society and despised by religious establishments  Origins of Species is a amalgamation of Darwin s comprehensive analysis s on various physical characteristics of animals that corroborate the theory of evolution  He gives thorough explanations on the difference between evolution of domesticated animals and wild animals  in addition to countless both factual and observational validations that introduces the reader to a entirely new way of thinking about evolution  The book goes beyond than the mere platitude explanations of evolution  and gives the reader a in depth and insightful view into the mind of a extraordinary man   Inarguably the most magnificent compendium of observations about life on Earth  An enjoyable read for the science minded  An essential but unlikely read by for those who still cling to the allegories and metaphors of the Bible as a true origin story  I have  for a lifetime  held some grievous misconceptions about the man and his work  I doubt that I am a lone victim in this deceit  I did find his pervasive redundancy a little tedious  He exhausts the speakers mechanism of telling you what he s going to tell you  telling you and then telling you what he s told you  I wonder if this may have been common in scientific papers of the time  I had always assumed that he was an atheist  He was not  In fact  I consider the contents of this book to be compelling evidence that there is a God  I m no longer convinced that creationism and Darwin s theory are mutually exclusive  If this old  but very relevant  book has  until now  eluded you too  I think you may find it valuable on a number of levels  It s surprising to me just how clear and simple the original case for evolution was put forward  It would have been very hard to argue against it 100 years ago let alone today with all the confirming evidence from bio chemistry and genetics  This is also a good example of what science is all about  He spends a little bit of time putting forward an idea  Then he spends a very large amount of time coming up with arguments and reasons why his idea should be proven incorrect  Then he explores each idea honestly offering points of view from each side  He clearly is interested in finding the truth and not in being correct  It s very discursive  You can almost hear Darwin pulling up a chair to the fireplace to discuss this idea he s had  And he s thought about it a lot It s also very cleverly written  starting with something the reader knows about  the human breeding of pigeons  then expanding slowly from that to the new stuff  but returning to that base whenever Darwin needs a clear  easy to understand example It s a complete refutation of the  one great man makes a giant leap for human understanding  way of looking at scientific progress  with Darwin being very careful to say where and who he has got information from and whose ideas he s building on  even if he s retested as much of the info as he can and tested his theories as best as he can   He s also a lot nicer about his fellow scientists than a look of books today are I like that Darwin states the parts where his theory might not explain everything  and that he uses observation to try to plug those gaps He might have been able to cover more detail in the book if he stopped apologising for the amount of stuff he couldn t put in Looking backwards from what we know now  it s amazing how close Darwin gets to being right about most of it  and a lot of his uncertainties could only have been cleared up once genes and sequencing were discovered There s a couple of points where he wanders down paths that turned out to be dead ends  recapitulation theory is bunk  and we ve still not got a  how  of instincts  but given the information Darwin had to work with  he s right more than he s wrong It s pretty much a must read for scientists  and it s reasonably accessible to non scientists  and a fairly straight forward read once you ve got used to certain Victorian writing quirks Definitely worth reading  I thought that at my age  69  it was high time to read what it was that made people crazy about where how man came to be I am a Christian so I grew up in total belief of what an un Christian heretic Charles Darwin was    an advocate of the Devil  As I became able to think and reason in high school and college I came to the conclusion that my church leaders simply took on faith their beliefs and took refuge behind their shield of  That s the Word of God   and an absolute fact  A class on Comparative Religion showed me how much different religions could interpret something  that they agreed happened  in totally different ways Additional theories  particularly the BIG BANG Theory  convinced me that Darwinist s and Creationist s were arguing about opposite sides of the same leaf Additional reading about Darwin convinced me he was a confused and troubled man  Raised as a Christian  and even studying for the clergy before finding his vocation  Darwin believed his scientific observations argued against God  I firmly believe if he had lived to see other scientific observations and theories he would have been able to reconcile his scientific observations and his religious beliefs I ve never been more comfortable in my belef and my faith  I an enthusiastic Christian Darwin never said that man evolved from monkeys  While we share 99  of our DNA with certain species  no one has been able to find the  missing link   My theory is that these genetically close animal relatives devolved from man at some time in the past An Agnostic would be perfectly at ease with my theory  The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin is book I have been meaning to read for a very long time  It was a more challenging book to read as I had to constantly remind myself that the information in the text was more historical than accurate in the modern sense  now that we have genetics and phylogeny to support Darwin s original ideas  But  there s no doubt about it  Darwin s controversial book is one of the most important publications in all of human history  especially in the scientific world  Darwin s brilliant relation to the public of his ideas  especially in a time when most scientific work was only shared amongst the scientific community  He first begins  step by step  going through how we breed animals and plants and how that relates to natural selection    clearly making his audience out to be common folk who can have little to no scientific knowledge  I believe everyone should read The Origin of Species as it is such a historical and monumental piece and  besides the old fashioned language  is a sort of beginner s guide to the scientific theory of evolution   Proud to have ticked this off the bucket list  Exceeded my expectations  as for some reason I read Descent of Man first  and this is far superior  My thoughts drift to a recent interview Dawkins gave to a young theologian  who accused him of  talking all that fancy Darwin talk   Now having read Origin  I find that comment hilarious  Darwin is anything but inscrutible  his devastating argument is fueled by timeless logic based on the straightforward evidence available at the time  This book is a compelling read  I must say  I approached the subject solely to understand the reasoning behind the rejection of creationism  in favor of evolutionism  Though one might find it hard to read this book at first considering the weight of the subject discussed  after little adjustments made  one would gladly find that this book is readable and enjoyable at the same time  For when else would one indulge oneself better on understanding the mighty creation of this world but to read a book on such a matter The concept of the  Tree of Life  as proposed by Darwin  is one in which he believed that we  humans  animals and plants  descended from a common ancient source which had lived in a period that is so remote  that throughout a long continued  slow and gradual process of evolution would produced varieties of only a small  insusceptible degree of variation at first  and under the means of natural selection  the kind of variations or modifications which are deemed to be of advantage for the survival for life would be preserved  accumulated and later inherited by the descendants  The descendants would then branched off further from this parent species  varying at an ever larger degree  accumulating a much bigger and better variations and modifications that are helpful to survive the competition between other organisms  Thus at one point  these descendants would attain forms and structures which are strikingly different from the parent species that it would then be referred as another distinct species  rather than just varieties of parent species  So  under this theory  one common parent species could produce multiple new species throughout the means of natural selection  In other words  it would be hard to believe the independent creation of distinct species  given the relations these species have between one another  ie  quagga and zebra   To put it in the most simplified form I must admit however  I failed to grasp firmly of his objection against the theory of creation in regards of his theory of evolution  It must be that I personally found it hard to believe that the incontestable and inimitable degree of perfection and complexity of the creation of this universe  including its inhabitants  could only be reasoned with such a simple explanation  that it was created out of nothing  Also so random of the whole processes that it made me cringed all the while  disbelieved  Darwin had put forward and addressed some grave objections that he expected to arise after the publication of his book  he addressed some so well they were appraisable  yet some like the imperfection of geological record is disputable  still  Nevertheless  my objection could have come solely from my ignorant and knowledge that is far from perfection on the subject I would not say that evolution does not exist  Darwin could be right  to certain extent  I took into likings some of his inferences  But he could be wrong at the same time  for I believe that nature and its force alone could not produce such perfection of a highest degree  Might it not be probable that both creationists and evolutionists are right all this while  Might it not be probable that to believe in one  does not necessarily propel one to reject the other  Might it not be probable that there is a creation which later on takes the form of evolution  Might it not be probable that religion and science could co exist in this world  Might it not be probable that what Darwin referred to be as a common source  to be of what the creationists believed as the Divine source    wm  wtytm mn l lm lW qlyl mhm  rfn fnn ln n rf lW  ql lqlyl fy s yn llwSwl l  lHqyq  lmTlq    drwyn

Darwin s ability to describe the theory of evolution  This  his finest and most influential work  is a complex  beautiful  and yes  very long culmination of half a lifetime of careful observation  Darwin was not by any means the first to espouse the theory of evolution  but he explained it more coherently and accurately than any other Take the time to read  Origin   and you will not be disappointed  It s not an easy read  but I found Darwin s science and reasoning to be fresh and relevant  over 150 years later  His understanding of the natural world and its development is staggering  considering what science had not yet revealed about genetics and heredity Without a doubt  this is among the most important books I have ever read  It was dense  but surprisingly enjoyable  I heartily recommend it to anyone curious to understand our world  and life on it  a little better  One of humanity s greatest scientific works  Even though it is difficult to read due to its Victorian language  and the many references  it is science  after all   it is well worth the effort  Even though we understand much more about evolution than Darwin himself did  it is great to see a most wonderful theory at its humbler beginnings  The ending not only summarizes the theory very well for the layman  but it is also a work of art  Thus  from the war of nature  from famine and death  the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving  namely  the production of the higher animals  directly follows  There is grandeur in this view of life  with its several powers  having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one  and that  whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity  from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been  and are being  evolved  P S For bookkeeping purposes  I read the 1st edition of the book  When Charles Darwin wrote this book a wave of misinterpretation of he wrote went through the scientific and religious community of this time and unfortunate until today there are people that quote Darwin but never read his book  AN example   Darwin said that we come from monkeys  Darwin never said that and it was one of the reasons I bought this book so I will finally really find out what Darwin really said He expressed the most natural thing  something that is occurring in front of our eyes every day  that species in order to survive and multiply they must be able to evolve  he presented the evolution that all of the species on this planet either slow or fast do at some point in their existence in order to continue living  Wonderful book anyone who doesn t believe but instead searches and researches and wants to call him her self a human being should read this book  Buying the first  unedited version is absolutely essential  Darwin later changed his views on several parts of his theory  influenced by outside forces  and the clarity of thought is therefore lost  The first edition is simple  clear and concise  very well written with extensive examples of his theory from around the globe and is a real eye opener to his thinking behind this revelation  I recently finished reading the classic  The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin  This book has been on my reading list for quite sometime  particularly after reading The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins Below are key excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful Finally  varieties cannot be distinguished from species  except  first  by the discovery of intermediate linking forms and  secondly  by a certain indefinite amount of difference between them  for two forms  if differing very little  are generally ranked as varieties  notwithstanding that they cannot be closely connected  but the amount of difference considered necessary to give to any two forms the rank of species cannot be defined  In genera having more than the average number of species in any country  the species of these genera have more than the average number of varieties  In large genera the species are apt to be closely  but unequally  allied together  forming little clusters round other species  Species very closely allied to other species apparently have restricted ranges  In all these respects the species of large genera present a strong analogy with varieties  And we can clearly understand these analogies  if species once existed as varieties  and thus originated  whereas  these analogies are utterly inexplicable if species are independent creations Owing to this struggle  variations  however slight and from whatever cause proceeding  if they be in any degree profitable to the individuals of a species  in their infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to their physical conditions of life  will tend to the preservation of such individuals  and will generally be inherited by the offspring  The offspring  also  will thus have a better chance of surviving  for  of the many individuals of any species which are periodically born  but a small number can survive  I have called this principle  by which each slight variation  if useful  is preserved  by the term Natural Selection  in order to mark its relation to man s power of selection Natural Selection acts exclusively by the preservation and accumulation of variations  which are beneficial under the organic and inorganic conditions to which each creature is exposed at all periods of fife  The ultimate result is that each creature tends to become more and more improved in relation to its conditions  This improvement inevitably leads to the gradual advancement of the organisation of the greater number of having beings throughout the world  But here we enter on a very intricate subject  for naturalists have not defined to each other s satisfaction what is meant by an advance in organisation And this  I am convinced  is the one hand  and the tendency to reversion and variability on the other hand  will in the course of time cease  and that the most abnormally developed organs may be made constant  I see no reason to doubt  Hence  when an organ  however abnormal it may be  has been transmitted in approximately the same condition to many modified descendants  as in the case of the wing of the bat  it must have existed  according to our theory  for an immense period in nearly the same to our theory  for an immense period in nearly the same any other structure  It is only in those cases in which the modification has been comparatively recent and extraordinarily great that we ought to find the generative variability  as it may be called  still present in a high degree Whatever the cause may be of each slight difference between the offspring and their parents  and a cause for each accumulation of beneficial differences which has given rise to all the more important modifications of structure in relation to the habits of each species It has been objected to the foregoing view of the origin of instincts that  the variations of structure and of instinct must have been simultaneous and accurately adjusted to each other  as a modification in the one without an immediate corresponding change in the other would have been fatal   The force of this objection rests entirely on the assumption that the changes in the instincts and structure are abrupt Hence it seems that  on the one hand  slight changes in the conditions of life benefit all organic beings  and on the other hand  that slight crosses  that is crosses between the males and females of the same species  which have been subjected to slightly different conditions  or which have slightly varied  give vigour and fertility to the offspring Thus the appearance of new forms and the disappearance of old forms  both those naturally and those artificially produced  are bound together  In flourishing groups  the number of new specific forms which have been produced within a given time has at some periods probably been greater than the number of the old specific forms which have been exterminated  but we know that species have not gone on indefinitely increasing  at least during the later geological epochs  so that  looking to later times  we may believe that the production of new forms has caused the extinction of about the same number of old forms The inhabitants of the world at each successive period in its history have beaten their predecessors in the race for life  and are  in so far  higher in the scale  and their structure has generally become more specialized  and this may account for the common belief held by so many palaeontologists  that organisation on the whole has progressed  Extinct and ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of the more recent animals belonging to the same classes  and this wonderful fact receives a simple explanation according to our views  The succession of the same types of structure within the same areas during the later geological periods ceases to be mysterious  and is intelligible on the principle of inheritance It is interesting to contemplate a tangled bank  clothed with many plants of many kinds  with birds singing on the bushes  with various insects flitting about  and with worms crawling through the damp earth  and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms  so different from each other  and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner  have all been produced by laws acting around us  These laws  taken in the largest sense  being Growth with Reproduction  Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction  variability from the indirect and direct action if the conditions of life  and from use and disuse  a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life  and as a consequence to Natural Selection  entailing Divergence of Character and the Extinction of less improved forms  Thus  from the war of nature  from famine and death  the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving  namely  the production of the higher animals  directly follows  There is grandeur in this view of life  with its several powers  having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one  and that  whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity  from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been  and are being evolved A highly recommended scientific read  Ce livre est absoluement fascinant  Tout ce qu on nous apprend a l ecole est la  Il y a par contre certains points a laisser de cote mais dans l ensemble tout est  vrai   C est tres bien explique  Il parle autant des points positifs que negatifs  Meme ceux n ayant pas etudier en biologie pourrait comprendre mais avec un peu de difficulte  This has to be the greatest called shot in the history of writing  When the views entertained in this volume on the origin of species  or when analogous views are generally admitted  we can dimly foresee that there will be a considerable revolution in natural history  It s not boasting when you re right  Damn  Charles   Every scientist should read this book  Especially the first and second editions  It s actually surprisingly well written  with doses of wry humor here and there  But it s main strength is just the insight into a brilliant mind at work  There can be no better lesson for someone intersted in a career in science  As someone with a PhD in evolutionary biology this is an awesome book  Reading this while working in the same field makes you realise the genius of Darwin  many of this things he stated still hold true  often after having been challenged within NeoDarwinism and coming back full circle to Darwin s original proposal  Yes it s long and  yes it s a bit dull by its repetitive aspects  But  once we step back to enjoy the whole picture Darwin is here painstakingly painting  the whole reveals itself to be a stroke of genius absolutely marvelous  A beautiful big bang  still resonating today  A beautiful must read  Expectations high because of its reputation  I found the book slow paced and quite boring  Not a word about human evolution  Darwin was no Dawkins in terms of wording and pacing  but this book led to a major paradigm shift in human thought  Its enormous impact cannot be disputed  A revolutionary book   It s amazing how this book set ground for The Theory Of Evolution as we know it today  Darwin concluded  through observation  that modified offspring subjected to the process of natural selection allowed life to gradually evolve on Earth from simple forms to more complex ones  And he was right   Well  not about everything  Since in Darwin s time nobody had the slightest idea about genetic code and the fossil record was kind of limited  some speculations and hypothesizing had to be made throughout the book  However  thanks to the advancements in different fields of Science  Today we have a better understanding of how we and other life forms evolved on this planet  And there s still a lot more to learn  Darwin would be really surprised   Darwin is exceptionally good at clearly explaining what he sees  Modern Biology formed itself around the refinements of Darwin s theory  Nature  no longer a Moral presence  is revealed as a chance constructed  machine    The book was fantastic   Darwin made many arguments to prove how natural selection was the driving force of evolution  He also provided many counterarguments showing how scientific reasoning wasn t perfect  The book itself was written in a lovely way  I am someone who hates nonfiction  but I love biology and am a strong believer in evolution and enjoyed reading this book greatly  One thing that many people may not enjoy about Origin of Species is that the book itself is extremely slow and dry  There are parts which are incredibly slow and I had to drag myself through the chapter little by little  Besides those certain areas  I greatly enjoyed the book and recommend it to any science lover  Good luck  Over the years I ve read parts of the book but never the whole thing  The simplicity Darwin s elegant logic lays out the principle of descent with modification with such elegance you wonder how there could possible be any disagreement as to how species arise over time  The real achievement of Darwin s theory of natural selection is that it can be concluded simply through the observation of life s current diversity and distribution  Darwin had no knowledge of the mechanics of DNA to create variation and a limited fossil record  but those recent discoveries only add further strength to the evidence Darwin had through his collection of living flora and fauna  All current species are descendants of previous forms with features modified and adapted where they prove to be beneficial in that environment  This is why we see the same bones in the human hand  bat wing  seal flipper and horse foreleg  We all share a common vertebrate ancestor who had carpals  metacarpals and phalanges  modified from a previous form  and have inherited slight modifications as the families  genera and species  And it s the same with all attributes  physical and behavioral  groups diverge from previous forms as slight modifications  which prove beneficial  compound and ultimately a new species becomes separate from previous forms Some of the most interesting parts of the book focus on anomalies which at first glance would seem to undermine Darwin s theory but ultimately only strengthen the argument  Why no mid oceanic islands have indigenous frogs or newt even though the climate would be very favourable  why alpine geese who never swim have webbed feet  why desert dwelling woodpeckers who never peck trees retain their features are only three interesting aspects of descent through modification The language is a little challenging but the content is anything but dry  Recent editions contain editor s notes citing subsequent evidence that supports Darwin  While  On Origin of Species  is no  page turner  it is worth sticking with  Darwin s delicate and precise passion for nature and his Natural Selection are at once incredible and endearing to read   Not to mention scientifically beneficial   Gracious  I love Charles Darwin   Very dense and demanding reading listening  I mostly listened to a Librivox reading of the work   often repetitive  and brilliant  What he says applies to every aspect of life on this planet  In 1966 this book had me expelled from a private catholic high school due to an argument with a nun who was teaching biology  It was 3 days before I was re instated into that school  Everyone should read at least an abridged version of this book  It is essential to understanding the living world  The scope of knowledge and the thoroughness of the author are impressive  Even if you have already read  Origin   it is worthwhile to hear Richard Dawkins narrate this abridged version on audio  One biological genius reads the work of another   Like many of you  I know that the current view of the world is fundamentally shaped by the thought and writing of Darwin  and perhaps like many of you  I had still never considered reading the book itself  Well  I have now  and I am beyond glad  Darwin is not only a careful  conscientious thinker  he is a very articulate and skilled prose stylist  I was lucky enough to find the book on CD  read by Richard Dawkins  another one of my heroes   so I picked it up immediately  The combination of Darwin s lucid presentation of his theory and Dawkin s familiar  trustworthy voice made this book easier to follow and to enjoy than many contemporary thrillers  whose sentences are often as plodding as they are obscure   This book made me marvel again at how tenuous in their beginnings are the truths we later accept as fundamental  That Darwin made his voyage  did his research  lingered over his thinking  and then wrote a book as brilliantly clear in word  sentence  chapter  and thesis is a wonder that we should create an official U S  holiday just to celebrate  How about Evolution Day  Even better  maybe we should just add an eighth day to the week so we can enjoy our good luck to have been born in such a time and such a place  Darwin Day could easily and appropriately precede Sunday  Read this book  Civilization depends on your support  Happy Birthday Charles Darwin  Today is Feb  12  Charles Darwin s actual birthday  I finished reading this a few days ago  but I wanted to publish my review as part of today s celebration  I also read this book as part of the ReadHarder 2016 Challenge  What I found most amazing about this book was the unexpected insights  He would be describing some principle of natural selection and then he d give an example of how it was working in a particular environment  and you ll think   Wow  I didn t expect that  I didn t expect his observations to be so insightful   I mean  this was published 157 years ago and still has so much to offer  Darwin changed the world like few ever have or will    natura non facit saltum  is repeated throughout this fascinating book  It gets rather dense at times but well worth the read  Towards the end of the book  the author states  all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection   I would agree with the former but question the latter  If our violent society is indicative of approaching perfection  we have been waylaid on the way  Many of the authors contemporaries disagreed with Natural Selection and the author spends a lot of time vociferously and methodically countering those arguments  I look forward to reading one of his biographies   Main breakthrough in science  and the original research is explained clearly with good prose  If that is not amazing  nothing is  dawkins reading the most important books of our time was amazing  I plan on listening to this again very soon  khyly dbyt mshkhly drh  m fwq l dh s  mkhSwSn

scientific minds of all time  and definitely the greatest observational scientist of them all  Only  Principia Mathematica  by Newton has influenced the scientific community more than this treatise  Evolution is a fact of life  Galapagos Island or North America  Asia or Africa  Earth or off world   A molecule of life must exist to transmit information through generations     Charles Darwin  proven correct almost a hundred years later with the discovery of DNA  Spectacular introductory book for my journey into scientific literature  First chapter was challenging but got used to his writing style few pages later  Some impressive imagery used in here  Darwin is an artist and a scientist Some may not enjoy the thorough explanations and examples he provides  it can be taxing  but then again  if you wanted a bedtime story  you picked the wrong book   I found his experiments with flowers  pigeons  bees delightful  Five stars because 200 years later  it still generates readers   The greatest book ever     While the Theory of Evolution is not a new one   it has been articulated centuries before by Ibn Khaldun and others in the Islamic world   Charles Darwin was the one who discovered it from a scientific point of view and made an argumentation that is beyond any doubt I think this book should be read by all of us  as it is and will remain of reference for generations to come  It absolutely revolutionized science  for the good   philosophy  in various ways  but also society  it paved way for dubious ideologies   Case closed   Should be required reading for all students of biology and ecology  Ecological principles are explained so eloquently  and his prose brings light and life to topics covered in sometimes clipped and phlegmatic biology textbooks  It s been a joy for me to read this for its thoroughness and careful analysis of different arguments for and against speciation by natural selection As someone who has made biology and environmental sciences her educational background  I will say it s useful to know of the things that we know now  The obvious is Mendel and the principles of genetic inheritance  Darwin spends lots of time musing various ideas about how traits are passed on  and why variations occur  It s also useful to know of other biological phenomena  like of Environmental Sex Determination  invasive species  K  and R  selected species  and different examples of reproduction strategies  Darwin spends a lot of time wondering whether climate acts on traits  and how sexual vs  asexual reproduction are advantageous  so knowing in advance current data and theories helps to appreciate what Darwin understands as a 19th century naturalist  Common biological terms  such as parts of the plant  stigma  style  anther   and terms like analogous  homologous  and rudimentary  are also useful to know  but Darwin expounds so much on these ideas  that I m sure even someone unfamiliar with these terms would come to understand them well after reading this book Like Rachel Carson s Silent Spring  it does pile on the examples  this can be boring  so I d say put the book down and instead listen to Origin of Species on tape  I listened to Origin on tape  and I plan to afterwards read it in Spanish A word of warning  this is a 19th century British gentleman  so words like  civilized  and  barbarians  are definitely there  Also  this sentence   If it could be proved that the Hottentot had descended from the Negro  I think he would be classed under the Negro group  however much he might differ in colour and other important characters from negroes   Probably not a sentence you d find if a 19th century  Negro  or  Hottentot  had written the book  Thank goodness we re in the 21st century  at least most of us   Another bit of antiquity  is the idea Darwin sometimes gives of creatures coming to  perfection  overtime  with more recent forms more perfect than previous forms  I don t know if this is just a manner of speech  as there s nothing very scientific about such an assertion  so I ll have to read it again to see if this is the case All that said  this book is fantastic  Very quotable  and very comprehensive  To begin with  a note on the edition  This Barnes   Noble Classics series version is based on the first edition of The Origin of Species  which is actually nice for a couple of reasons  First  it allows the reader to experience the book as it originally appeared  This is not only interesting historically  but a nearly unmitigated virtue because of the second reason  The core content of the book remained essentially the same throughout the later revisions Darwin made in his lifetime  but such changes as he did make were for the most part unnecessary or even  in retrospect  unfortunate   mainly minor concessions to skeptics  religious and otherwise  and to the Lamarckian theory of evolution  as opposed to natural selection as the basic mechanism driving evolutionary change   return  return That said  there are several things to say about the book itself  First  it is extremely readable  Modern audiences  especially those educated in the American government schools  which almost certainly failed to introduce them to this material  might be intimidated by the prospect of tackling a somewhat technical scientific volume of this size written a century and a half ago  Those who attempt it  however  will be pleasantly surprised to find that Darwin s presentation is extremely clear and intelligible  at times even beautiful  This admirable writing style is in large part due to his scientific method  which leads me to the book s next great virtue  return  return Darwin s approach is primarily inductive   that is  he was not some armchair philosopher abstractly theorizing off in an ivory tower somewhere  as one might suspect from the photograph of him as a bearded old man with which we are usually presented  In other words  evolution is not  just a theory   precisely because Darwin was not just a theorist  Rather  Darwin gathered massive amounts of evidence on his Beagle voyage  and continued to accumulate ever more  with the help of his scientific colleagues in various related disciplines  for decades before he felt ready to publish his theory  and he still felt rushed into it    Indeed  for anyone interested in the philosophy of science  or in epistemology in general  On the Origin of Species should be the textbook case of scientific induction   Darwin then presents all of this evidence to us piece by piece  building up his case from the ground  as it were  and in effect recreating his own line of thinking for his reader making it incredibly easy to follow his case  return  return Which brings us to the third point  What kinds of evidence does Darwin draw on  Intriguingly  Darwin did not begin his career as a biologist aiming to solve the species question  He boarded the Beagle as a brilliant amateur natural scientist generally with an inclination toward geology  Perhaps this is why he was able to draw so widely on various fields in making his case for evolution when that question did become his main interest  From Lyell s theories and his own geological observations  Darwin concluded that the period of time available actually allowed for a very  previously unthinkably  slow process of evolution  From this geological perspective  he naturally was able to look at various pieces of evidence more directly bearing on the species question  such as the fossil record and  more importantly  the geographical distribution of species  After the Beagle voyage  he was able to conduct experiments in many other areas  and correspond with colleagues about the results of their experiments   including artificial selection  Darwin s pigeons being the most famous example of this  which became important as an analogy for the process of natural selection  the means of the geographical distribution and isolation of species  including seeing whether seeds can germinate after extended periods of submersion in salt water or passing through the digestive tracts of birds   and even the sex lives of barnacles  All of these experiments are described at some length in The Origin of Species  return  return But Darwin  ever the scientist  was in fact cautious not to overstep the limits of what he could prove  The Origin of Species contains an excellent chapter anticipating and answering possible objections to his theory  and acknowledging its shortcomings  For instance  Darwin acknowledges that the fossil record at the time did not tend to show gradual progression from one species to another  and offers an explanation as to why the fossil record might be so incomplete  He also acknowledges that while he found the evidence for evolution by means of natural selection to be overwhelming  he did not know the actual physical  biological mechanism by which this takes place  as genes had not been discovered and the discipline of genetics created at that time   but he does briefly mention a hypothesis that was actually sort of on the right track  In fact  in all of these weak areas  subsequent history has borne Darwin and his theory out remarkably well  return  return And finally  in addition to being a masterpiece of scientific thought  The Origin of Species is also a work of  at times  almost poetic beauty  and deserves praise for its literary merit  After presenting or indicating all the evidence in a specific area throughout each section  Darwin ends each chapter by summing it up in an eloquent statement naming the general principle to be derived from this vast array of specific evidence  often employing an apt and evocative metaphor  The most famous of these passages is of course the one with which he concludes the book   Thus  from the war of nature  from famine and death  the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving  namely the production of the higher animals  directly follows  There is grandeur in this view of life  with its several powers  having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one  and that  whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity  from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been  and are being  evolved   return  return You cannot legitimately consider yourself an educated person if you haven t read this wonderful book  and yet a shockingly small percentage of Americans  including even those who claim to believe in evolution  have read it  But you will find that to do so is not a chore  but one of life s great pleasures  Holy wow  What an immensely prescient work  What an incredible man Darwin must have been  I feel like what those swooning idiots feel when they faint all over Justin Bieber  Charley  I would totally swoon over you He thought about massive geologic change before we knew about plate tectonics  he thought about a single common ancestor before we knew about DNA  he thought about psychological aspects of evolution before we ve even come up with theories about it What  A  Dude  As it says on my coffee mugs at home  Darwin is my homeboy Side note  I was surprised that he took kind of a combative stance against Creationism   actually calling out arguments and saying how creationism cannot actually explain any of them  I thought I ve read that he was quite nervous to offend any of the old guard and hesitated in speaking his mind  I also thought I read that his wife was very religious and he tried to temper his words because he didn t want to upset her  I shall have to go back and find where I thought I saw all that  In any case  wonderful book  I did a class on Evolution in college and am shocked that we weren t REQUIRED to read this  It is a must that people know exactly what Darwin s contribution to our current understanding of the world is This is on the re read list   El origen de las especies   5 estrellasEste libro es en realidad un largo texto argumentativo  que hace uso de todos sus recursos  y que para quien guste de la biologia  paleontologia  geologia o simplemente le interesa el tema  le va a resultar apasionante e intrigante  Darwin explica muy bien cada uno de sus argumentos  incluso sometiendose a si mismo a las criticas de otros cientificos y los pensamientos religiosos opuestos  Esto perdura hasta el ultimo capitulo  donde realiza un resumen de los resumenes previos  muy concluyente Me gusto mucho encontrar que su escritura era muy buena  temia que por el hecho de ser de la rama de la biologia  la redaccion o traduccion fuese mala   porque suelo encontrarme con esos inconvenientes  Si bien es verdad que constantemente utiliza tecnicismos y los nombres cientificos de ciertos animales o plantas  se puede leer y comprender de todas maneras el punto general al que se refiere Me parecio sorprendente que hace tanto anos este hombre  mediante estudios arduos y observaciones  haya descubierto relaciones entre especies que expliquen su origen  y quiza echen luz sobre el nuestro tambien   hechos que ni siquiera yo sabia hoy  convengamos que tampoco soy una especialista en el tema   De alguna manera  sentia que estaba viendo un muy buen documental sobre la evolucion  Pero no es solo eso  abarca un monton de datos y detalles  que siempre se vinculan  y no te deja lugar para la duda  Fue un adelantado  una mente admirable de curiosidad implacable  un visionario para su epoca y para todas las epocas  Me llevo varias frases resaltadas de este libro Si te gusta la biologia o ramas afines este es un must read  super interesante Por ultimo  al final del libro lei la pequena resena de la biografia del autor  No se si no lo recordaba o no lo sabia  pero a pesar de lo revolucionario que fue la introduccion de su teoria en el mundo  seleccion natural  la superviviencia del mas apto  el darwinismo   y la conmocion que eso causo  sobre todo en la religion  Darwin creia en Dios  Es decir  antes de embarcarse en sus famosos viajes  estudio Teologia en la Facultad de Estudios Cristianos en la Universidad de Cambridge  para convertirse en clerigo rural   Es el colmo  De hecho  alli conoce a otro cura y botanico  quien lo conduce a su posterior expedicion  No solo se tuvo que anteponer a las creencias y criticas de todos  sino a las suyas propias  que quiza sean las peores  no lo se  Ello explica  quiza  porque en sus pensamientos nunca deja de mencionar la concepcion del creacionismo  En fin  me parecio un dato no menos importante  pero mejor paro aca  porque sino cuento todo el libro  Primer libro terminado del 2015  Muy bueno  My public school education on Charles Darwin was scant  to say the least  The story was simple   that he was a clergyman who went on some world travels  noticed some peculiar things about the adaptation of animals  and came up with a theory of how that happened  basically on a hunch After reading this book  I found that there was so much more to it than that Darwin presents more than just a hunch  but a thoroughly and honestly investigated theory explaining all the life on Earth today  He collected absurdly detailed data on plants and animals  especially pigeons   and compared data with scientists all over the world  Darwin was more than a guy with a hunch  he was a true scientist I expected a lengthy  boring  and difficult to read book full of things I already knew from reading other books on evolution  mainly Richard Dawkins  Instead  I found an extremely well built case full of great evidence  arguments  and insights This is a must read for all science minded individuals  I read Origin after being inspired by Richard Dawkins  love of Darwin  even if you hate Dawkin s  a position which would be quite understandable  it s difficult not to be charmed by his affection for Darwin   It s probably also required reading for an aspiring biologist  Given the period it was written in  and the circumstances of its publication  having its publication brought forward to claim precedence on the idea   I was pleasantly surprised by the book  First  it s very readable  I d recommend it as a general introduction to evolution for the layman  The language is clear and not stilted as you might expect from a book of the period  There also isn t a constant effort to disprove or ridicule religion at the same time as proving evolution  As such I d probably also recommend it as the book for a curious creationist  Dawkins would probably be too offensive  Second  Darwin s ideas on evolution are quite fully formed  I knew he d been amassing evidence for evolution  and planned to amass even more before publication  so I was expecting the many  and I mean many  examples of organisms that supported his theory  or hypothesis  as it was at the time   I wasn t expecting him to have considered as many implications or requirements of his theory as he did  and to then have performed experiments to try and prove that he could account for these  The distribution of species is a particular example  where he had considered that similar species are present on sometimes distant islands  and had carried out numerous experiments with floating seeds in seawater and seeing how long they could stay afloat  If only plate tectonics  or continental drift as it was called when it was proposed  had been suggested 100 years earlier  Of course Darwin wasn t quite right in several respects  and some of Alfred Russell Wallace s views would prove to win out  such as allopatric speciation being the main mechanism by which speciation occurs   but that doesn t detract from how impressed I was at how complete and modern his theory of evolution was I m tempted to read more Darwin  especially his  The Various Contrivances by which Orchids are Fertilised by Insects   but I know that they ll contain significantly more examples than Origin  which has too many itself  I think the temptation to read Darwin on one of best topics   orchids   will win out in the end  It s either orchids or pigeons  and I don t think I could bring myself to hear about pigeons that much  After reading Darwin s  On the Origin of Species  I can see why its been noted as one of the most significant books ever written   especially when it comes to scientific literature and observation  I ve come to realize that many of Darwin s ideas are over emphasized  underestimated  and way ahead of his time To my point on being over emphasized  I have heard many assumptions by many people that assume Darwin wrote this book in a way that pushed evolution to being the explanation for all of life s origins  Many of his ideas and observations are either taken out of context or argued in a way that makes it seem like Darwin had all the answers  If people who openly debated evolution actually read this work  they would come to understand that many of his ideas make perfect sense within the context of his observations  He also dedicates a full chapter to problems with his theory   many of which are some of the arguments still made today To my point on being underestimated  I think that when people have taken Darwin s ideas out of context they are missing a grander point in that natural selection is a means by which we can explain evolution and change through time  I think that many people also misunderstand Darwin s observations in that he was able to use empirical evidence to support his ideas  which can be easily overlooked by individuals that attack his theory as an  opinion  or theory without explanation To my point on Darwin being ahead of his time  I found it extremely interesting that he was able to make predictions about tectonic plates and the movement of the earth s continents that allowed for the geographical distribution of species 50 60 years before scientists began working off of the theory of plate tectonics  I think many of his other observations have since been confirmed regarding inheritance  now that we have the technology to craft phylogentic trees and such   even to the extent of using mitochondrial DNA and rRNA to track ancestry Altogether I found this book fascinating and look forward to reading it again  I ll also look forward to checking out his other writings at some point  Part of me wishes I would ve read this book in college when I would ve had more opportunities to explore his ideas as well as take advantage of professors that could have spoken at great lengths on the subject Pros  Truly a classic when it comes to scientific observations and how science should be performed Cons  The chapter on hybrids was a bit dry and hard to follow Bottom line  Excellent read for anyone interested in life s origins or how there is commonality amongst life forms  This is probably the single most important  most impactful book ever written  I guess Principia Mathematica would be up there   Anybody read that lately   Some might argue that the Bible  or Koran  or other religious texts are more influential  1859 was an epoch changing year  The history of science and the mind will never be the same  Explanations of life  philosophy  medicine  religion and psychology after 1859 were forever altered  and ancient ideas were laid to rest forever  No single book has altered the course and scope of human thought so radically  The ideas contained in it are the foundation of biology  the basis on which medicine is built  and the key to the workings of the human mind We can t unmake the truth of this book  The genie won t be put back in the bottle   Not without the destruction of the modern  secular  technological society as we know it   though many people would like to see that happen  Don t underestimate their power and numbers worldwide  And this is not to overstate the role or contribution of Charles Darwin  Alfred Russell Wallace also discovered the same truth  And if they hadn t  someone else would have  But one must admire Darwin s judgment  his understanding of the power of the idea  and his subsequent caution in its use   his modesty and his humanity  Natural selection could not have picked a better spokesperson  This book is written in an accessible style  but it s not gripping or explosive  Darwin  understanding the power of the idea  is methodical in his presentation  citing a long list of evidence for his idea  and directly addressing issues threatening to undermine it  This is more like a legal argument than a passionate harangue on a new world order  But the fuse was lit  The fireworks have followed Most of the book stands the test of time  Darwin rarely made claims that he couldn t justify  If you want to read a book about evolution  there are many up to date and more entertaining books available today  And there are a host of books on the impact of the idea  But if you want the original book   the original spark   of a world changing idea  you need to read this  I ll end with two quotes from the book  In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches  Psychology will be based on a new foundation  that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation  Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history    p  458  Thus  from the war of nature  from famine and death  the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving  namely  the production of the higher animals  directly follows  There is grandeur in this view of life  with its several powers  having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one  and that  whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity  from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been  and are being  evolved    p  459 60  I have been delaying reading this book for some time now  I was afraid that it might be written in some form of older English and  combined with the subject being rather technical  I might have trouble understanding it  especially given that English is not my primary language But I have to admit that I was wrong in all counts It was written in a language that may have been technical at the time  but now  with my limited knowledge of biology  I had no trouble understanding  It s use of English wasn t difficult either But why did I give it five stars Evaluating this book is tricky business  Obviously Darwin didn t have the knowledge scientists have today  and his book has been surpassed by many discoveries  He was also wrong in at least one thing  where he says that dogs did not evolve from wolves  or so I understood  I may be wrong   but given his level of knowledge you can t hold it against him and evaluate using today s standards  So this is not an issue It is also not a literary book but rather a scientific one  not meant for the layman  So  I can t compare it with Stephen King for example  or any other novelist Considering however the impact this book s idea had  the effort Darwin put into it and the evidence to back it up  I really think you ll have a hard time finding a book that is more important than this one Hence the 5 stars  Like Newton  Darwin stood on the shoulders of giants  Like Locke he was an empiricist  relying on reason and close observation  Like Bentham he was a utilitarian  not interested in human nature or the order of the universe or wisdom handed down through the ages  or the Bible   Darwin was interested in what he could measure  In prose accessible to the general reader Darwin isn t asking why there are so many kinds of animals  or what did God have in mind  Darwin asks a genealogical question  how did so many kinds of animals come about  Like Wordsworth and Coleridge he has wonder about Nature  He wants to observe  to be in the thick of it  so he goes on a 5 year voyage on the Beagle  For the next 20 years he catalogues his findings to a fare thee well  true perfectionist that he is  and then is abruptly impelled to publish because his acquaintance Wallace stumbles on the concept of evolution in a malaria induced delirium  Now that he s on the hot seat we finally hear about Natural Selection  that progress happens through unintended  minute  contingent variations that then get propagated  if they are advantageous  over very long periods of time  I am glad I read this as an audio book  the sometimes very detailed narrative just kept going even if I got a little lost in places  and I was able to pick up the thread later on  I may have struggled to get through this if I d chosen to read this  The Audible version of this is  appropriately  read out by Richard Dawkins  who narrates well  I was surprised how clear Darwin s argument is  I read somewhere that his purpose was to write a book for the general public  which perhaps explains why he begins with a chapter on variation in domestic species  I reread the last few paragraphs a number of times   they are surprisingly poetic for a science manual  Also  I would say this is a must read for anyone with a passion for science fiction  as Darwin s explanation of life gives us a very wide perspective on our day to day lives  placing our individual beating hearts in a context of all life struggling to come first over a very long period of time  I recommend reading Richard Dawkins  book The Selfish Gene before reading this  The shockwaves from the publication of this book still resound today  The full title of the book is  On the Origin of Species By Means Of Natural Selection or Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life  by Charles Darwin and it was first published on November 24th of 1859  The importance of the work was not in the originality of the idea  the idea of evolution had been a theory long before as Darwin discusses in the text  nor was Darwin the only scientist at the time to arrive at the theory  as a paper by Alfred Wallace arrived the same year as Darwin s  What made  The Origin of Species  so significant was the way Darwin discusses the theory  and that it was not written just for scientists  but for everyone  This makes it a work of Literature as well as one of Science Another key aspect to  The Origin of Species  is that it has completely changed the focus of the subject from the point of its publication until now and undoubtedly will do so for some time to come  It is still the dominate point of reference in the argument between those who oppose the theory and those who support it  Those on both sides of the argument  and I use the term argument because the term discussion would lead one to believe that the discourse is much more civil than it actually is  would do well to emulate Darwin in the way he discusses his theory  The Origin of Species  in many ways sets the standard for scientific argument  Though again Darwin did not create the standard with this book  the significance of the work and the readability of the book make it stand out as an example of the correct way to present and defend a theory  Of course Darwin presents facts which support his theory  but it is his discussion of problems with the theory which is the strength of the book and his theory  Darwin admits he doesn t have answers to all of the issue  and he offers ways to prove his theory wrong or at least force a significant adjustment to the theory It is interesting that the issues with Darwin s theory and the methods of proving it wrong are in many ways unchanged  There will always be gaps in the fossil record  and there will probably always be questions of reducibility  but that doesn t mean that there isn t more evidence to support the theory than there ever has been  there is a lot more which has strengthened the theory  and the key point is that there hasn t been any evidence found to disprove the theory  And with regards to species being fixed  the scientific argument has long been over  though one can still find non scientists who would argue the point  The Origin of Species  remains an important work of science and literature today  Understanding Darwin s theory is necessary to understanding the political discussions and ramifications that continue to take place  It also serves as a great guide to understanding what a scientific discussion is and how it works  and by contrast how it differs from a political  social  or theological discussion  It should go without saying that  The Origin of Species  gets five stars  and the introduction by John Burrow enhances the experience by putting it in the context of Darwin s life  and the times in which it was written and published  I was a little surprised that the Penguin Classics edition didn t include any notes on Darwin s text  but it does include a bibliography of Darwin s works  Also  while the text included is from the first edition of the book  it does include  An Historical Sketch  and a Glossary which were in later editions  So wonderful to read  in ways I can t even explain but that have to do with confronting what Darwin actually says after years of being exposed only to hearsay through the cultural ubiquity of his ideas  To feel informed  to come face to face with the actual words  is both relieving and empowering  The problematic implications of his ideas  eugenics  etc   are almost entirely absent here  they surface far more troublingly in the Descent of Man  and surface even more in work inspired by but not connected to Darwin himself The Origin is at once  as my professor puts it  more ordinary and more radical than one expects  Darwin emerges as a smart  funny narrator  a gentleman scientist storing pigeon carcasses in the bathtub and gutting fish at the dinner table  He knows what he s doing is groundbreaking  and yet he tries  for very personal reasons given his wife s religiosity  to minimize the controversy  His figurative language is beautiful  and his dual audience of scientists and laymen makes this a smooth read and a fascinating venue for thinking about the literary qualities of scientific explanation I highly recommend the Oxford World s Classics edition because a  beautiful cover b  Gillian Beer s introduction is one of the most helpful introductions of anything that I have ever read  c  I liked reading from the second edition  which followed closely on the heels of the first  Darwin changed little here  but the changes were significant gestures towards the religious uproar over the implications of his theory  and this edition was widely read  The later editions strip out even more of the figurative language  How can I not give this 5   Even though it s a bit wordy and unclear in places  even though my Kindle version had diagrams missing and even though I pretty well understood the whole concept of evolution before I started reading it  this is still a masterpiece beyond any doubt  The nitty gritty and repercussions of the details regarding animals  plants  insects  geology  geography  the timescale of the evolutionary process  the age of the Earth  embryonics  morphology  systematics and ultimately Creationism  is quite astounding  Hardly a stone is left unturned  Darwin was very close indeed to at least fathoming out the existence of DNA If I have any criticisms  it s that this is quite clearly an academic piece  The wording makes it almost inaccessible to the average  or younger  reader which is somewhat of a shame  Some chapters are rather pigeon centric and Darwin occasionally flits from one rare plant to another rare insect to the point where everyone but the most academic of naturalists lose the thread  The recap section is rather long and feels a little like reading the whole book again  A few more diagrams  or even pictures of the particular organisms geology mentioned would certainly help  even if they were copper plate etchings or water colours contemporary with the book  Darwin must ve considered splitting the book into sections focused on animals  plants  insects etc  but has instead chosen to sort by topic  which didn t always seem ideal from this reader s point of view  although considering the scope of the book  quite understandable from the author s point of view A thoroughly thought provoking and quite unmissable read  Having learned  Darwinian evolution  back in school  it has been something I ve gone back to in my mind time and again    in college  while reading light or heavy science articles  in conversation  and even during software programming design  But I had never actually read Charles Darwin s earth shattering publication that changed the way Life itself is viewed I don t think you could ever call this book anything but a heavy read  But it certainly did not disappoint  It s a little bit weighty to be reading text that had such a huge impact on world science   both then and for the 150 years since   The only other book that comes to mind that even comes close is Newton s The Principia   Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy   which I now need to also add to my list   Admittedly  that was part of what bumped it for me from 4 stars to 5 Some of the material was unexpectedly dry  For example  an in depth discussion  controversial at the time  on the difference between  variety  and  species   Other parts were unexpectedly new and refreshing  His description on instincts in inheritance with  among others  a convincing argument on exactly how bees form geometrically perfect hexagonal hive cells was engrossing  I think when most people picture a proof of evolution it includes trail of fossil records  It really surprised me that Darwin s argument was terribly convincing  even though a lot of the  new  concepts are now ingrained into our basic thinking  with zero reference to fossil records   In fact  the one fossil topic in this book was disproving the apparent lack of a fossil record that was   at the time   expected to support Darwin s argument  It s hard to imagine some of the ideas presented being controversial   almost as hard to imagine as people still evidently having a problem with them today  I would love to find a book on the impact of this book in Darwin s era  AUDIO NARRATION  David Case also narrated Don Quixote  His crackling  british accent is very distinctive which had my brain confused for a while on which book I was listening to  Good overall  but it wears on you after a while   477 pages  Donated 2010 May Natural selection is introduced by Charles Darwin as an explanation of life on Earth adapting itself to exist in the environment where it began and gradually change to become better suited to the surroundings it would progressively encounter as it traveled to other locations in search of the necessities for survival  At the end of the book Darwin wrote that  Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history   His theories of a common ancestor  species variation  evolution  and eventual extinction have paved the way through whole disciplines of sciences to a transforming brilliance of creative purpose  The evidence Darwin presents is direct and persuasive enough to overwhelm his critics  Please Note  This book is easy to read in true text  not scanned images that can sometimes be difficult to decipher  The Microsoft eBook has a contents page linked to the chapter headings for easy navigation  The Adobe eBook has bookmarks at chapter headings and is printable up to two full copies per year  Both versions are text searchable What a book Charles Darwin s theory of natural selection has been called  the best idea that anyone ever had   and I am tempted to agree  Darwin s great insight was that in the same way that humans breed plants and animals with certain characteristics  nature  breeds  itself  and creates variation He notes that all creatures reproduce at a rate faster than the earth can support them  and so many of them must die  He realized that it is not random which individuals die and which ones live  Rather  those that are best fitted for their environment are most likely to survive  Over time  the attributes that allowed them to survive will be passed on throughout the population  and will supplant the old population Darwin s realized that these small  gradual changes were strong enough to create all of the diversity around us  over time  He uses embryology  the fossil record  migration patterns  classification patterns  and the existence of rudimentary organs as evidence for his beautiful theory  Since then  we have found more and more evidence for the actuality of evolution as  the origin of species  I highly recommend this book  Some of it is fairly dense and repetitive  but it is wonderful  It provides a new way to see the world  and as Darwin says in his concluding paragraph   There is grandeur in this view of life  with its several powers  having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one  and that  whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity  from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been  and are being  evolved   Darwin s species isn t extinct  but its longevity is not beyond doubt  His kind has always been rare  hunted tirelessly by the more savage varieties  driven to the extremes of the literary environ  lost  forgotten  near the point of vanishing  With so little hold  it bears asking  would we know his type if we saw it  Can we still say what it was that defined his breed  How it was that they made their way  Let me say something about these questions The Origin of Species tasks itself with accounting for the organic world  what explains the arrangement between species  their differences  their constitution and behavior  how it has occurred  and why  What an ambitious undertaking  Darwin s answer is that species are related by a common descent  modified over time  and that this is explained by Natural Selection  This submission is Darwin s source of fame  it is novel  compelling  intuitive  and possesses implications that carry into the philosophic realm  But this is not what distinguishes him  There is another feature of The Origin that equals  and in my opinion  surpasses Darwin s contribution to biology  In a breath  that is its fullness A good argument begins with sound premises  proceeds by valid inferences  draws well prepared conclusions  and  of equal importance  contends with viable alternatives and serious criticisms  The Origin of Species advances along precisely this path  Even more  Darwin s argument moves with so much care and deliberateness  meeting every problem with a refreshing sense of honesty  that he nearly exhausts the reader with his diligence  But the weakness there is ours  not his  Darwin isn t shy  and his discussion guides us around every issue   confronting  methodically  all the difficulties and overcoming those that he can  and identifying those that he can t  Where other authors would slur or elide  Darwin faces up  offering his best treatment  and always with an eye to the stakes involved Don t get me wrong  this is no paean to Darwin  The Origin is far from perfect  His writing is often recondite  the persistent contrasts with Creationism dubious  the discussion is starved of imagery  his sentences are frequently untamed  and run on at extra ordinary length  he abuses the semicolon  and major concepts become confused as  for example  with Natural Selection  whether it considers only the Good of the individual or  as he adds later  the  family    And  if so  how is the family delineated from the rest of the species  But  let all these charges attach to The Origin  its accomplishment as an argument  its fullness  exceed these petty complaints  The theory of Natural Selection may have created Darwin s notoriety  but it is the ability of his argument that will keep it  Whether Darwin s thesis is ultimately right or wrong  I don t know  but his exposition is a model for everyone to follow  It is a rare kind that can so completely and sincerely meet the demands of an argument  It is my prayer that his type does not pass out of being   I listened to the audible version with Richard Dawkins as the narrator  I loved the book and will listen again with Kevin  We all know the basics of the theory  but to actually read what Darwin wrote about the subject is fascinating  Of course he was writing at a time when his theories were not well known or accepted  so he had to write in a way to defend and convince  The complexities are incredible  The presence of cats in a neighbourhood for instance  would change the population of rats and mice and as a consequence insects  plants and more  The best line from the book was regarding his ability to convince the other naturalists  impossible to convince those older men     whose minds are stocked with a multitude of facts  all viewed     from a point of view directly opposite to mine     A few naturalists endowed with much flexibility of mind and who have already begun to doubt the immutability of species  may be influenced by this volume  but I look with confidence to the young and rising naturalists  who will be able to view both sides with equal impartiality    If you had an idea  perhaps one of the most important ideas of all time  but one that contradicted the established doctrine of a millennia old institution  how would you convince people your idea was right  And let s make no bones about the importance of Darwin s theory of evolution  As  the Russian Orthodox Christian  Theodosius Dobzhansky would famously put it over a century after Darwin s masterpiece was published   Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution  Looking at the modern online  debate   and by using that word I stretch its definition well beyond its elastic limit  between the pro  and anti evolution camps  it s a rather depressing scene  The anti  camp tends to get hung up on the meaning of the word  theory   I m currently striving to make a career out of studying number theory  Given that the theory of numbers requires an abstraction of thought far more chimerical than any theory in the physical sciences  perhaps these masters of debate would suggest that numbers don t exist either and thus the Thomas More Legal Centre will start giving out millions of dollars to the needy    after all what is a million  No  seriously  what is a million   Or in a more earthy example courtesy of Tim Minchin  maybe those who dismiss evolution as being  just a theory  feel the same away about the theory of gravity  and maybe they ll just float the fuck away  The pro evolution camp fares little better to be honest  and by the pro  camp I m not talking about the scientific community  Scientists know evolution is the basis of how life works  most of them are about as willing to have serious debates on it as I would be to debate the true value of pi  No  by the pro  camp I mean the youtube commenters and the such like whose responses to Creationists tend to invoke the promiscuity of the latter s mother Based on modern sentiments  then  to convince Victorian England that his theory of evolution was correct Darwin presumably launched a scathing attack on the Church and highlighted the fact that we must descend from smelly  hairy apes because he d seen yo  momma  Zing So is that how he kicks off his treatise  with a rousing assault on the enemy  Not exactly  He talks about dogs  And chickens and goats  And Mr Blyth  who knows more about domesticated fowl than you or I ever will  Oh  and pigeons  There s a great deal about pigeons  The first chapter is in fact distinctly unrousing   We know all this  Charles   you feel like yelling   Shut up about the God forsaken pigeons already   Chapter two rolls around and the talk of pigeons ends  Praise be  What begins is Darwin s definition of  species   Given the work s title it seems fair enough that we should know what a species is  so Darwin defines one as being a collection of animals that can interbreed  He notes some empirical facts about the geographical distribution of genera and varieties and again the whole chapter is entirely unobjectionable Chapter three follows up by pointing out that exactly how one wishes to divide up living beings into groups is immaterial and will always be slightly artificial  What we can agree on is that within each grouping of alike animals or plants there is individual variation  as discussed in Chapter 2  and we know from domesticated animals and plants that living things tend to pass on certain characteristics to their offspring  and if we didn t know that when we started the book we do after the extensive discussion in Chapter 1  Finally  again from domesticated stock  we know that offspring inherit much from their parents  but will sometimes have quirks of their own  Spend enough time gardening or with an isolated group of animals and you won t be able to refute this  Thus  Darwin points out in Chapter 3  what happens if one of these distinct quirks the offspring develops is actually advantageous  Slightly better camouflage  say  or the ability to survive with less water  or seeds that are slightly more palatable to birds  or flowers that are more attractive to bees  By the definition of the word advantage this offspring would have a slightly better chance of surviving and producing offspring of its own  Only slightly better  yes  and still open to the whimsy of the environment  but better nonetheless  And if humans can turn wolves into Basset Hounds in a few hundred years  presumably over a few hundred thousand years these small statistical gains can add up to result in a living thing that is so far removed from its descendant that breeding would be impossible between the two of them  Thus we have  the origin of species Darwin  it should be pointed out  has nothing to say about your or anyone else s mother in The Origin of Species It s hard not to smile during the first few chapters of the book  Darwin lays out truths so self evident that no one could refute them without losing all credibility  It s slow paced  sure  but only because Darwin is making sure that there can only be one inevitable conclusion  Even if you think your faith is irreconcilable with the conclusions he draws I think you d be hard pressed to fault his logic  Indeed  most doubters of evolution seem to be Young Earth Creationists  those who believe that the Universe was created on Saturday 22nd October  4004 BC  a remarkably specific date determined by the Irish Primate James Usher  not to be confused with rhythm and blues singer Usher Raymond IV who  to the best of my knowledge  hasn t made any attempt to calculate the exact age of the Earth   It s no coincidence that the Venn diagram of Christians and non believers in evolution tends to intersect on this particular group  Darwin s theory requires hundreds of thousands of years for undirected evolution to work  A cat with laser eyes might have a massive advantage over its brethren but that advantage comes to naught if it gets ran over before it can make laser kittens  Over many years  though  the chances of every laser cat that randomly appears being ran over tend to zero  Fortunately for Darwin  Victorian geologists aged the Earth at many millions of years old  ample time for laser kittens As important as what is in the book is what isn t in the book  I smiled as I saw where Darwin was going with his argument  But oh how I cringed every time he tried to explain the mechanics of inheritance but couldn t because Mendel s theory of genetics wouldn t be widely publicised for another forty years  He also  wisely  doesn t apply his theory to humans  merely suggesting near the end of the final chapter that via evolution   Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history   By the 1870s and his publication of  The Descent of Man  England had almost unanimously accepted evolution and was thus more willing to accept that man too had evolved from  lesser  lifeforms  Indeed  one of the more controversial aspects of Darwin s later work wasn t that we might have evolved from the same creature as did chimpanzees and orang utans  but that the civilized English gentleman sipping his tea in the club was of the same species as the dark skinned  spear carrying savages one heard of in fantastical books  That even this revelation was accepted by the majority of readers hopefully conveys the power of Darwin s arguments  And one more thing that doesn t appear in The Origin of Species is the woeful line that  we evolved from chimps   Few statements show a more feeble understanding of evolutionary theory than the notion that most extant species have been the same for hundreds of thousands of years while new species branch off  After all  Image by Matthew Bonnan as part of the Second annual Stick Science Cartoon Contest  Whatever your personal beliefs  it s hard to claim that The Origin of Species is anything short of a masterful argument  If  as Young Earth Creationists claim  God made the Earth look four and a half billion years old  hid fossils in the ground  and constantly tweaks species to better suit their environment but makes it all look like it s occurring naturally  then Darwin simply brought us all one step closer to understanding God  If on the other hand God either isn t there or doesn t care  then Darwin brought us one step closer to understanding the Universe itself  and I can think of no goal more sacred than that  Origin s ideas  and the astronomical consequences of its publication  mean it completely deserves at least five stars  The fact that Darwin dared to go against the religious doctrines of the time  and  by extension  set himself up for untold ridicule and possible eternal damnation    That he could think in a whole new way  and open his mind to possibilities way outside of these supposedly unquestionable truths that were thousands of years old    It s so amazing  Major respect  Charlie Origin of Species is a truly deep and exhaustive account  the crowning lifetime achievement of a clearly fascinating man  whose extensive knowledge and experiences add a real richness to the narrative The work itself  of course  centres around the evolution of life by means of natural selection  and largely hinges on analogy between this and artificial  human  selection  using the easily accepted truths of domestic breeding to introduce the potentially scary   especially for the time   subject matter It s remarkably well conceived  A lot of the arguments and explanations I heard as a science student today were direct from the book  more than 150 years after its publication Having said that  not all of the content ages so well  Darwin went to great lengths to persuade his 19th century readership  and  as a consequence  some parts can be a little tiresome to a modern day reader in the know  Nowadays  many of us accept   with little doubt   a lot of the basic facts Darwin labours to convince us of  such as variety between animal individuals  which now seems so simple  Darwin was also unaware of Mendelian genetics and accurate geological time frames  meaning he could only speculate as to the mechanisms of inheritance and the age of planet Earth  Since the book s conception these fields have advanced hugely This makes it all the more incredible  really   in many ways D was far ahead of his time  If only he d waited for the pesky fields of genetics and geology to catch up  he d have had such an easier time upon publication All in all though  it s a fantastic read  if you re into biology    I can imagine it being very dry if science ain t your thang   Although  perhaps  if you want a truly comprehensive account on evolution  there are plenty of more up to date texts around But it s still a captivating read  even if you just want to revel in the wonders of what this guy did  and the incredible things he accomplished  I found this to be quite Monotomous at first due to the fact mostly everyone is taught his theory of evolution by means of natural selection from a very early age  Darwin lists an incessant amount of evidence backing his theory  The first half of the book is extremely detailed and at points rather slow  However  it must be remembered that this book was written at a time where the majority of the world believed in Creationism and much of  if not all of his theory was quite new and scary  The endless examples and anecdotes make it for the reader to understand this quite intricate theory in a relatively simple form  The fact that his theory was generated and manifested without the use of DNA and modern technology is utterly remarkable  The second half of the book consists of examples that are taught much less  to my knowledge   I found the last 1 3 of the book fascinating as Darwin begins to write much more philosophically and attempts to subtly criticise the more widely accepted views of the society in his present day This book paved the way for the expansion of naturalist sciences  evolutionary sciences and led us to an immensely detailed account of how all species have most probably evolved from one or few primordial species  I would fully recommend this book to anyone  It is relatively easy to understand and you will definitely begin to see the natural world in a different light  If you can plough through the first half of the book you will definitely not be able to put it down  Enjoy Luke I approached this in the same way I did when I decided to read The Bible  Basically thinking  well if I m going to say I believe this stuff I better read the book   and expected it to be incredibly boring  I was wrong  I loved it  I wouldn t recommend it to people just as a book to read  you have to love science to appreciate it  but I m more impressed with Darwin than ever before  This guy was fantastic  I listened to a good majority of it on audiobook and the guy reading it has an English accent and gave a slow nasally tone of voice to it that made me picture him in an old drawing room just casually making conversation about his latest travels to foreign lands while holding a giant brandy glass   Think Higgins from Magnum P I   I also found it ironic to listen to this as I worked since I read DNA  The whole time and especially when he s trying to figure out hybrid characteristics and how they work  I couldn t help but thinking  if Darwin only knew what I know  what I have literally at my fingertips  All in all it was fantastic reading  he got so much right with such limited information and was such a pioneer of science and ideas  Other than that what can I add in my review to the reputation of this book  I think it gets a bad rap  I don t see what the big deal is  Like I said  I read The Bible too  My primary reason for reading this book is its historical significance  It bothers me that humans  until as recently as Darwin  did not seriously ask about the origin of species despite interacting with its members every day  That this revolutionary idea should have occurred to one person as opposed to many in an incremental fashion  is far from obvious   and extremely interesting retrospectively  Are there any other such revolutionary ideas that ll later be trivial to everyone  Darwin supported his argument meticulously by observations  made by him and others  and their sheer number is so mind boggling that I fell asleep more times reading this than any other book  It amazes me how he summoned up so much enthusiasm to study and compare the most boring habits of some of the dullest creatures  There is no reason to read this book to understand natural selection   our knowledge now is a far more superior and complete  I had already read The Selfish Gene  had already experienced the profound  OMFG  That s Brilliant   reaction that rapidly morphed into a  Duh  Isn t that obvious     Yet  Origin was an enthralling read for the most part  with many opportunities to pause  wonder  daydream  extrapolate  apply the theory to modern humans and computers  and so on  This is a fairly long book about a seemingly tautological argument  I highlighted a large number of lines and took down a few notes on my kindle  A short summary of my observations  and a few quotes to give you the taste of what most of the book is like  follows  1  Variation   Darwin appreciated that variability exists in nature but he did not seem to explore the causes or consequences   which is understandable as genetics was ahead of his time   It may seem fanciful  but I suspect that a similar parallelismextends to an allied yet very different class of facts  It is an oldand almost universal belief  founded  I think  on a considerable bodyof evidence  that slight changes in the conditions of life arebeneficial to all living things   Again  both with plants and animals  there is abundant evidence  thata cross between very distinct individuals of the same species  that isbetween members of different strains or sub breeds  gives vigour andfertility to the offspring   Dominant species belonging to the larger groups tend to give birth tonew and dominant forms  so that each large group tends to become stilllarger  and at the same time more divergent in character   Widely ranging species vary most        and varieties are often atfirst local   both causes rendering the discovery of intermediatelinks less likely        And if there be any variability under nature it would be an unaccountable fact if natural selection had not comeinto play  2  Cooperation   Darwin appreciated that environment in the form ofsunshine  water  temperature   non living stuff    wasn t the primaryreason for success of life in its complexity  and that inter speciesinteraction is a large cause  However  he talks about competition much like Dawkins  but not much about cooperation  like Lynn Margulis  Ithink cooperation is much less apparent when you just look at thephenotype  It seems to me that it is more widespread on the smallergene level with microbes and viruses exchanging chemicals frequently  andhence completely understandable why Darwin was unaware of it  This long appeared to me a great difficulty  but it arises in chiefpart from the deeply seated error of considering the physicalconditions of a country as the most important for its inhabitants whereas it cannot  I think  be disputed that the nature of the otherinhabitants  with which each has to compete  is at least as important and generally a far more important element of success   Bearing in mind that the mutual relations of organism to organism areof the highest importance  we can see why two areas having nearly thesame physical conditions should often be inhabited by very differentforms of life  for according to the length of time which has elapsedsince new inhabitants entered one region  according to the nature ofthe communication which allowed certain forms and not others to enter either in greater or lesser numbers  according or not  as those whichentered happened to come in more or less direct competition with eachother and with the aborigines  and according as the immigrants werecapable of varying more or less rapidly  there would ensue indifferent regions  independently of their physical conditions infinitely diversified conditions of life   there would be an almostendless amount of organic action and reaction   and we should find  aswe do find  some groups of beings greatly  and some only slightlymodified   some developed in great force  some existing in scantynumbers  in the different great geographical provinces of the world  3  Ontology of god   Darwin did not comment much on Man  but he didmake strong rational arguments against creation  and understood the philosophy of science  Why should all the parts and organs of many independent beings  eachsupposed to have been separately created for its proper place innature  be so invariably linked together by graduated steps  Whyshould not Nature have taken a leap from structure to structure  Onthe theory of natural selection  we can clearly understand why sheshould not  for natural selection can act only by taking advantage ofslight successive variations  she can never take a leap  but mustadvance by the shortest and slowest steps   But many naturalists think that something more is meant by theNatural System  they believe that it reveals the plan of the Creator but unless it be specified whether order in time or space  or whatelse is meant by the plan of the Creator  it seems to me that nothingis thus added to our knowledge  4  Altruism   Darwin identified and seemed to have understood theconundrum posed by  selfless  individuals of the ant of the beecommunities  Since his argument is at the species level  it was easierfor him to reconcile the selfless acts of a few  slave  members asbeneficial to the species  Dawkins  must have had a tougher time ashis arguments were at the genetic level  but even that was resolvedwhen it was shown that slave members had a different gene compositionthat made it advantageous for their genes to die in the service of thequeen s genes  Finally  it may not be a logical deduction  but to my imagination itis far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckooejecting its foster brothers   ants making slaves   the larvae ofichneumonidae feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars   not asspecially endowed or created instincts  but as small consequences ofone general law  leading to the advancement of all organic beings namely  multiply  vary  let the strongest live and the weakest die   for if on the whole the power of stinging be useful to the community it will fulfil all the requirements of natural selection  though itmay cause the death of some few members  5  Falsification   I think it is important to note that when agroundbreaking theory is introduced  it should make some substantial claimsthat are against common knowledge  Although Darwin did not tackle allthe implications of his theory in this book  he did make remarkswhich  at that time  would perhaps have been considered quite bold  hence there seems to me to be no great difficulty in believing thatnatural selection has actually converted a swimbladder into a lung  ororgan used exclusively for respiration   After having read so many contemporary books and hearing so many presentations and creationist debates over the years  I have to say I was shocked to find that the case for evolution was made so convincingly so long ago  These days  it s hard to imagine doing research without the internet  much less the telephone  but through decades of research  Charles Darwin was able to amass an astonishing collection of samples  drawings  and testimonies from other experts around the world  With these  he was able to infer more about the geographical and chronological distribution of species than I ever thought possible at that time  He rightly anticipates every major objection to his theory that has been proposed up to this day  and unlike I ve been lead to believe  is not at all over confident about what we can expect to learn from the fossil record in the future  He even touches on the two major areas of study that weren t well understood in his day  the methods of inheritance and drifting of the continents  In many modern editions of The Origin of Species I m sure editors notes will abound pointing out how overjoyed Darwin would be if he could have known how well we d grow to understand these things over the course of the next century This book is still completely relevant today  and is perhaps still the best summary of how we ve reasoned that evolution must occur  I highly recommend it  I always knew that On the Origin of the Species was an important book in the annals of scientific writing but I always assumed it was because it was the first to lay out a complete argument for evolution  I had no idea what a stunningly awesome  in the original meaning of inspiring awe  example of argumentation and reason the book truly is  Darwin not only comes up with a theory but he imagines every possible argument against it and counters each with facts  reason  and where warranted the weaknesses of his own arguments As I read through the book I could not help but remember that so much about what he reasoned must be true has been proven through fields of later science  I wonder how much stronger Darwin s already almost unassailable argument would have been had he met Gregor Mendel in his research  Many of the parts of his arguments where reliant on reason could have been even stronger had he had knowledge of genes and the laws of inheritance There are areas were Darwin was a little wrong  For instance  he asserted that evolution must take place very slowly but in the 20th and 21st century very fast evolution has been observed multiple times  e g  antibiotic resistant bacteria   He also was much more pessimistic about how much would be preserved in the fossil record  He was convinced that we would likely never be able to identify truly intermediate forms but there are now relatively complete series of forms for multiple groups including horses and whales I believe everyone should read this book whether or not they are religiously fundamentalist or not  On the Origin of the Species is the best example of argumentation I ve ever read and it is clear why it is among the top 100 books of all time on many lists  Come on  everyone  Set aside all the rants you hear about how Darwin was anti God and how social Darwinism is an extremist idea  Just read this book and see what Darwin actually had to say for himself  I m sure we ve all heard about natural selection and all that at some point in our lives  whether it was in a biology class or a religious fanatic ranting If I were to be asked which book has has the greatest influence on me  it would definitely have to be The Origin of Species  Darwin s controversial magnum opus  As of now  I am 14 years old and I really like science  and I m somewhat mocked for it  but  oh well  What I was actually expecting was a dry  boring read  but the whole reason I picked it up in the first place was because it was the fountainhead of all biology  The end result was much different What I really got was an extremely well written and engaging book  Darwin actually knows how to write  What s even better is that he backs up his theories with so much evidence  However  all this evidence can make the reading a little bit confusing at times  but overall it is definitely worth it   This is a work of absolute genius I was inspired to read it when watching the film  Creation   which is a beautiful and moving film about the family life of Charles Darwin that sadly was not locally available apparently due to anti Darwin prejudice     so anyway a friend pirated it  Though it didn t focus on his work  it included some quotations from  Origin  which were so well expressed that I began reading the book that same night  Unfortunately I was in the middle of a couple other books at the time and was distracted  so finishing it has waited until recently  I began listening to it on CD while on a solo road trip and am now nearly finished While listening  I was almost continually utterly astonished at its scope and at how well developed his theory was even at the time that he introduced the rest of the world to it  It is on the one hand a very simple idea  but with endless subtle implications touching on a vast array of facts and observations  an impressive fraction of which had been made by Darwin himself  spanning his own extremely productive lifetime and multiple scientific fields  To have synthesized so much otherwise confusing information and unified it under so simple and radical  at the time  a theoretical framework is such an impressive intellectual accomplishment  precisely because of how well Darwin demonstrates his detailed knowledge and appreciation of the natural world in its daunting variety and the difficult cases it presents  Indeed  a primary pleasure in reading this book is simply to learn a lot of fascinating and sometimes almost unbelievably amazing things about a wide variety of plants  animals  places  and processes  I had no idea so much was known in the 1850s  plenty enough to make me often feel more like I was on a field trip around the world than like I was reading a theoretical treatise Only in a few relatively unimportant respects did this classic book feel dated to me  I expected the 19th century ignorance of genes and DNA to leave a more gaping hole in the book  but  for example  contrary to what I ve read about  Origin   I don t even recall any part in which Darwin made any explicit or implicit commitment to the idea of  blending inheritance   which is considered fatal to the theory of evolution and not overthrown until Mendel  Maybe I missed something  it was an audio book after all   or maybe others have misinterpreted his discussion about how extinction of parent forms and of whole groups and the imperfection of the fossil record explains the lack of a continuous spectrum of graduated variety across all extant organisms  I didn t think the notion of a continuous spectrum needs to be taken too literally  and has room for discrete  but still small  mutations On the other hand  I was more confused by the discussion of Use and Disuse  It often seemed to have a Lamarckian flavor  and though Darwin amply demonstrated his understanding that natural selection can explain at least some cases of what might be attributed to Use or Disuse  I was never sure that he wasn t in general using these terms to mean some mysterious process separate from natural selection The lack of radiometric dates for strata and the lack of discoveries of pre Silurian fossils were further interesting reminders that this book wasn t written in the 21st century by some kind of biologist version of Carl Sagan or a more open minded version of Richard Dawkins  I wish Darwin could have lived to see these discoveries validate and further enrich the understanding he pioneered  but he made brilliant use of the information he had available  and I found it fascinating to see how well his arguments could be made even without the benefit of our ridiculously detailed  so it almost seems to me now  modern understanding of the exact mechanisms involved  as well as to see the interesting evidences that tend to be passed over now in favor of the kind of data obtainable only with today s tools I would recommend this book to anyone whose interest in the natural world exceeds their potential intolerance for long  even if elegant  sentences  and feel very sorry for anyone who is the other way around  And I include creationists in my recommendation  as long as their curiosity exceeds their prejudice  and I feel even more sorry for them if it doesn t  because they d be missing out on such a rich treasure trove of knowledge and ideas  As a child I never liked it when an adult answered a question I asked with   Because that s how it is  or some similar aversion  Thankfully  Darwin wasn t satisfied either  Darwin s greatest achievement here isn t the incredible collection of evidence he amassed and organized  nor is it simply the idea of evolution by natural selection  although both are worthy of 5 star reviews and a place in every science textbook on their own   His greatest achievement is fundamentally changing how we view the world and our place in it to a magnitude equal to or surpassing Copernicus s revolution  The idea that slight changes over time are as powerful a tool to build from the bottom up what we once thought could only come by magic from the top down is truly  as Dan Dennett puts it  dangerous  It undermines the legitimacy of top heavy power structures  it calls into question core assumptions we ve made about the world  and most importantly it provides us with a method to change the world  hopefully for the better and hopefully not so gradually if it is for the better    For anyone with any interest in reading  On the Origin of Species   this is a great way to read it  Costa s notes increase the length of the already pretty long  abstract  by at least 50 percent  but I found myself reading just about every annotation  often with more interest than Darwin s writing  Darwin is somewhat accessible  but his writing is of course dated  and it references a lot of dead people and dead ideas  which the added notes clarify beautifully  Recently an  illustrated  version of the book was published  edited by a more acclaimed biologist  David Quammen   and there were times when I thought I might have enjoyed that one  but by the time I finished the book  I was definitely happy I went with this version   Although undoubtedly the annotated and illustrated versions would compliment one another  Each chapter begins and ends with a brief summary putting the chapter into the context of Darwin s argument and research  The notes within each chapter are heavy on the history  to the degree that I started to wonder if the notes were written by a historian rather than a biologist  Costa has painstakingly researched not only Darwin s own personal development and the development of his research  but that of all his contemporaries  It s nice that the work of every referenced scientist in this book is explained in detail by a note  But it s even better that the same is done for nearly every plant  animal and geographic location  at least for a hack like me That said  I probably would have still liked reading the book without Costa s notes  Darwin was obviously brilliant  but even moreso  he was very careful in his research  careful in his claims  and especially mindful of every nuance of every detail of every argument  What makes the book especially fun is that many of the arguments in favor of natural selection that Darwin makes hardly resemble those that are made today  although while the evidence now would obviously be so much stronger and data driven  the logic would be similar   Darwin didn t even have the benefit of knowing the results of Mendel s pea experiments  let alone what  genetics  means  in his day  so how variation might work was nearly a total mystery  They knew very little about heredity in general  He had to get pretty creative with his experiments and his arguments  and while he s sometimes wrong  see his description of  reversion  or his discussion of cataclysms  for example   he takes lots of care to find his smoking guns The influence of Malthus and Lyell on Darwin s thinking was obviously very strong   on the shoulders of giants       In that respect  it s obvious that he not only had a good eye as a biologist  he would have been a terrific economist  I knew Darwin bred pigeons but I had no idea how much this book was about animal breeding  But it makes sense  since they knew so little about heredity in those days but still knew a lot about what happens when you try to cross species or breed plants and animals   Precious little about finches or the Galapagos  Sorry  Mom  As I write this  I m thinking about a long stretch of many pages in the book where Darwin speculates on how seeds can float across oceans or be carried on the feet of birds and potentially germinate on a distant land  And I think we are all better off that Darwin didn t have cable tv in his day Happy 200th birthday  CD  Absolutely a critical book for every living  breathing human being  Darwin s genius and ability to condense such difficult topics and make them palatable and understandable can NOT be overstated I truly believe this book is more important and timely than ever before while this country regresses back and is allowing  creationism  to gain in popularity through legitimization of disinformation  Facilities such as Kentucky s own Creation Science Museum reinforce this myth that the Bible s interpretation of creation is literal and true  all while under the guise of a  FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY  environment The largest problem central to  creation science  is that it s not science on the most basic level  It immediately denies evolution and seeks to do nothing to support its own  theory   which in the creationist sense literally means a wild guess   while only chipping away at perceived problems with evolutionary theory  And that s just it  perceived problems  not real problems I read this book as a young teenager and have carried through into my mid 20 s while strongly maintaining my unwavering belief in evolution ever since  Pick this book up and read it completely through   Nothing in Biology makes sense except in the light of evolution  Never has that phrase made more sense to me than it does now that I ve finished reading this book I ve always stood by the theory of Evolution by Natural Selection because it simply fits  but I realize now that I never fully appreciated its value as a scientific theoryIn Origin  Darwin discusses his reasons for arriving at the theory  details arguments made by other scientists against it and presents the reader with valid counter arguments  and later on uses his theory to explain several perplexing occurrences in nature  That is the scientific theory at work  a statement or set of statements  arrived at by careful observation  and which can explain and even predict several facts about the world I knew that Darwin s theory explains a lot of things in Biology  but I never realized the extent to which it could shed light on the natural world  None of the things he discussed in Origin were surprising to me  but I didn t think of them before either  It s very enlightening  and even excitingI think anyone who s looking to expand their knowledge on Science  and I don t just mean the facts but also the way of thinking  should read this book  It is not easy to get into at first    Darwin s intended audience were his fellow naturalists and not the general public    but once you do get into it  it ll give you a deeper appreciation of both the Theory of Evolution and the scientific method through which Charles Darwin formulated it   The Origin of Species  By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for LifeI read this incredible  historic book eight years after I retired from a career in academia  and the year after a visit to the Galapagos Islands  I suppose it took a visit to the Galapagos Islands to inspire me to finally get Darwin s gem and read it cover to cover  This turned out to be a wonderful investment of my time  A big regret is that I did not read this groundbreaking book early in my career  If I had done so  I could have benefited from Darwin s insights and his remarkable example as a scientist  I was unfamiliar with the vast scope of research he conducted himself  his scores of connections to other scientists before the era of modern communications  and his uniquely global perspective  I do not claim to understand everything I read in this superb  mind stretching book  But it was worth the effort  in spades  Origin of the Species should be a must read for everyone with a natural curiosity about life around us    Earl B  Russell Because Darwin was scrupulous about the details  this book is a rather dry read  Additionally  the principles of Natural Selection are already familiar to most readers before they open the book  But reading the original words of Darwin gives one a sense of history  you see the evolution  if you will  of peoples  understanding  You see the actual words that created a firestorm of debate which  because of the rational nature of Darwin s theory and writing  culminated in an almost total acceptance by the world scientific community within ten years of the book s publication  There may be other books that provide a more contemporary understanding and have more up to date biological facts  But reading the words that created the almost immediate growth in our knowledge and further cracked the foundations of an already weakened superstitious worldview  is inspiring  Scientists will tell you that the scientific method leads to steps of growth  not leaps  But for its time  this theory was a big step  Dovete sapere che ho una memoria davvero corta e non riesco a ricordare granche  ecco perche appunto tutto cio che ritengo piu importante  Prima credevo di ricordare i libri che leggevo  forse perche ne leggevo di meno   ma ora ho un assoluto bisogno di scrivermi qualsiasi cosa  Dato che non avevo nulla d essenziale da fare  stavo girando tra i miei scaffali di Goodreads per sistemare un po  qua e la dato che e una cosa che non occupa troppo forzo fisico o un occupazione mentale elevata  Ho trovato il romanzo di Darwin che lessi l anno scorso e cosi mi e venuta voglia di scrivere un parere un po  piu approfondito  Lessi  The Origin of Species  perche ero completamente indecisa su cosa prendere all universita e volevo farmi un idea dato che mi piaceva tantissimo la biologia ed era una materia candidata  E  stato davvero interessante leggere una delle teorie piu ammalianti della nostra specie  Charles Darwin ha sempre avuto la mia stima per aver fatto delle ricerche super approfondite e per essersi dedicato pienamente alla scienza  ed anche perche la mia prof lo ama infinitamente lol   ma leggere ancor di piu qualcosa di suo suo e stato fantastico  Lo consiglio a chiunque voglia farsi una cultura in materia   I decided that I couldn t truly say that I believed in  understood  and supported evolution as an explanation for speciation and biodiversity until I actually read this book  And so I did  It is an important  clearly written  well organized  scientific book that is very thoughtful and careful with its claims  Darwin provides countless examples in support of each  element  of the evolutionary process I loved the book and have zero regrets about reading it  but I will say that some chapters were pretty painful to get through  e g   the ones discussing continental drift   However  each chapter begins and ends with a thorough summary of every important point  and the book itself ends with an entire chapter summarizing the origin of species  If you find reading this book THAT painful  then you can easily stick to the summaries and still take away a majority of Darwin s most important points  This book is without a doubt a worthwhile read  and I will highly recommend it to anyone who has doubts about evolution s merits as an explanation   4 5 Stars  really  To say this book is  an important read  is such a massive understatement  it s almost not even worth mentioning  And yet  it seems like once a month  one of my friends baffles me with their special brand of misunderstanding  Some are positively intellectual contortionists in how they ve built a knot of erroneous beliefs about evolution  My purpose in reading the book was to be able to say to those friends  have you read Darwin s work   because I have  The point is  if you don t understand evolution   On the Origin of Species  is important to educate yourself  If you do understand evolution   On the Origin of Species  is important to educate others  And as important books go  this one reads pretty well  I was intrigued to see the links to selective breeding  And the many difficulties evolution faced in its development  And science is so often viewed as a body of facts  however it s always very interesting to me to think of new science in its historical context  That there must have been detractors  there still are today  and supporters  Darwin discusses them all  and he handles the criticisms judiciously  But perhaps the best part about the book is that Darwin rarely descends into  cataloging facts   So  it s not as dry a read as one might expect  It was an enlightening read  and not that dull  That seems a very reserved response for a 4 5 star review  but it seems to me to be the answer to the question you might be asking if you re thinking about reading it  For my own part   On the Origin of Species  satisfied my deeply curious nature while sparking in me a very real sense of awe and wonder at nature  Hence  my 4 5   This isn t a book you d read for fun  but for understanding and enrichment  Personally  I found it edifying to understand Darwin s thinking  In his younger days  he had traveled much of the world  and was primarily employed in collecting specimens from each region he visited  Over the years  he connected with farmers to discuss how different plants and animals were bred for certain traits  He catalogued the variations in species he would find in different areas having different  conditions of life   He studied and experimented as to how seeds  eggs  larvae  and adult creatures could travel from one place to another  He looked into the geological record and the fossil remains of creatures now extinct  He studies the embryos of plants and animals  and found that embryos of creatures of the same class had the same appearance and features  regardless of how different these creatures came to appear as adults  From a lifetime s study of all these factors  he came up with a unified theory of natural selection  In brief  that a creature s offspring will vary minutely in each generation  and that these miniscule variations give advantages to some and disadvantages to others  The most successful of these variations are passed on  Anyone desiring to understand evolution and natural selection needs to start with the Origin of Species  My understanding of evolution greatly  evolved  after reading Darwin s seminal text  I found the first chapter dealing with the domestication of animals very interesting in showing how great changes can take place in only a few generations  No one explains natural selection better than Darwin and his many examples wonderfully illustrate the power of evolution  I enjoyed Darwin s attention to detail and his willingness to engage with the opposition and counter arguments to his theory  Admittedly  the fossil record posed a difficulty in his day to evolution  but he handles it wonderfully and provides many logical and convincing explanations  I like how he deals with examples of irreducibly complex structures and recognizes the potential problem these examples pose for evolution  It s true Darwin didn t know of the true complexity of the cell  and it indeed is interesting to think how his theory would have been impacted if he had been aware  His musings about the inheritable traits in animals is so painfully reminiscent of Mendel  it s a damn shame Darwin wasn t aware of his work during his lifetime Beware  it s a long book  and no easy read   5 of 5 stars It s always a strange feeling  to finally read a book that you ve heard about for ages  will it live up to the hype  Equally  if it s a classic   Can  it live up to the hype  And it s even worse when it s nonfiction  and a foundational book in its field  because then you have to add  can it still live up to its reputation despite all the discoveries we ve made since then  It s a tough mix of expectations for any book But Origin manages to stand the test  and wonderfully so  And to my surprise  it wasn t a dry  dusty textbook either  a large part of why Darwin s text made the impact it did  I think  is because of how accessible it was  and still is   The arguments are generally very clear and straightforward  with helpful diagrams and many real world examples to demonstrate concepts  Most important concepts are carefully defined and eased into  new readers might miss many species references  doubly so because many order class species etc  classifications have since changed  which makes tracking them down difficult at times   but I don t think being overwhelmed with jargon will be a common problem It s really a joy to read  both in terms of structure   seeing how the case is logically laid out  and defined  and supported  step by step   as well as in understanding a little more of the history of science  it s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that Darwin was working in a vacuum  but seeing the constant references to other scientists  work  each providing a small piece of the larger puzzle  truly drives home the importance of collaboration in science  and synthesis across disciplines   And  for the geology buffs out there  you may recognize some of that field s foundational texts mentioned here as inspiration too   it was an exciting time to be alive  Even if you re totally new to biology  I d encourage you to give it a try  Origin might be a little dry  but the language is beautiful  and the concepts both brilliant and inspirational  Who knows  Maybe you ll find that you have a taste for evolutionary biology after all   in which case  Stephen Jay Gould s  Wonderful Life  should absolutely be your next stop     On the Origin of Species by Charles DarwinDarwin says that it is not possible to know if the variations of dogs come from one breed or from the cross of different breeds and that it would be interesting to know if variations occur within the same breed without mixing with others  It is in fact an oxymoron because the first breed  A  of any animal that mutated from another due to external environmental changes have kept the same physical and anatomical characteristics for hundreds of years  but taking into consideration that this breed was at once born from a mutation metamorphosis to adapt to environmental changes  then this breed can also mutate to create similar beings with small or big adaptations  At the same time  the initial animal that gave birth to the first breed  A  did it because its system identified changes that needed to be addressed and while it searches for the standard that the environment will set  it can or could breed other similar breeds  B  or  C  or more according to the specific changes of the moment when it got conceived He also mentions that the changes are passed more to the male than to the female  In this regard I can say that a male can impregnate many females and grow a breed while if the change was made in one female then it would take much longer for the breed to grow and most likely it would not survive  This also takes us to consider that the sperm is the one that carries the new data to program the egg with the mutations and the females that have previously mutated will continue procreate with the program that they have until they receive a change from one of the males  As continue reading I will learn more and see how my opinion evolves  just like the species    Fantastic book  chapter 13 was probably my favorite chapter  Thats where everything comes to a head and he brings up the similarities between different species as well as vestigial organs and how it could have served previous generations but be rendered useless or redundant now  It was impressive that he noticed and brought up several things that would later be fully explained by science  One such thing was linked genes  When talking about pigeons he mentioned that beak size and foot size would always be correlated  He admits hes not sure why but in all cases with pigeon breeding if you have a small beak you have tiny feet  As an interesting note  he never brings up the finches  Ever  He hardly ever mentions the Galapagos  Mostly that he visited it and it had a small highly specialized group of species For the most part he talks about fancy pigeons  So if you want an easier time reading the book go look up fancy pigeons  look at all the different breeds of domestic pigeons  memorize them  then read the book  Trust me he brings them up a lot   It s been criticized as unscientific  evil  and dry  I found it quite impressive  Though there are places where the detail might be too much for the casual reader  it is a very solid scientific work  He presents a hypothesis  shows significant supporting evidence  and defends it against the most common criticisms  It is not possible to prove that everything started from something simpler but it is now hard to refute that the natural process of natural selection is working on today s species  He leads his argument by showing the effectiveness that domestic breeders have achieved in altering species and guiding that process  Other highlights either new to me or especially interesting  the uniformity gained by consistent inter crossing  the underlying ability of genetics to allow breakthrough changes and yet also to maintain uniformity  the complexity of larger areas in producing stronger more adaptable species  the effect of geographic changes  elevation  land forms  glaciers  on migration of living species and archival of fossil record  that fossils tend only to be saved during subsidence so only that direction of change is recorded  the species do not reappear once extinct  this seems to be in refutation of Lamarck   the phrase  grain in balance  to show the impact of small differences in the competition for survival  that it is the other species more than anything that determines a given organisms ability to survive in an area  Imagine his chart demonstrating how branching might work if he had had a PC at the time  After reading the first edition of the great man s work  I can state with confidence Darwin was a great theorist and a daring and innovative thinker  Which is admittedly a bit like saying that Einstein was quite intelligent or that Galileo had a few good ideas in his day  Still  with Darwin s originality and his very character often under attack  it s good to actually read the man himself and realize that in this case conventional wisdom is conventional because it s true The idea of evolution itself was not original  and many critics of Darwin naively point to the existence of pre Darwinian evolutionary ideas in order to claim that he was merely a plagiarist  But Darwin s original conception was that evolution was a population level process occurring among varying individuals and that this population level process occurred by the statistical overrepresentation of some variants due to early death or failure to beget offspring  The centrality of this to understanding evolutionary theory today cannot be overemphasized  Darwin s statistical insights in biology were no less revolutionary in their implications and discombobulating to his contemporaries than Ludwig Boltzmann s insights were in the field of thermodynamics  Prior to and even for some time after Darwin  evolution was seen as a process driven by some kind of inner striving or by some motive force pushing individuals to ever  higher  or more  complex  forms  Darwin s conception did away with not only any need for the design argument and special creation  but also with any need for these mystical forces and strivings that supposedly made evolution possible People often say you can read the first half of the book  or even just the first four chapters  up to  Natural Selection   and understand Darwin s thought  Perhaps you can understand natural selection  but for my money the most dazzling originality comes in the latter half  where Darwin lays out the case for evolution in the most convincing manner  This was the section that wowed his contemporaries and led to evolution    but not necessarily natural selection    being accepted nearly overnight  If I were on the fence about evolution vs  special creation  Darwin on biogeography   Geographic Distribution   alone would have been sufficient to convince me  It would have thrilled Darwin to see that his insights have been picked up on and expanded by the development of plate tectonics  which solves his most problematic cases  At one point Darwin writes   The affinity  which  though feeble  I am assured by Dr  Hooker is real  between the flora of the south western corner of Australia and of the Cape of Good Hope  is a far more remarkable case  and is at present inexplicable  but this affinity is confined to the plants  and will  I do not doubt  be some day explained   This affinity was very well explained by the discovery that South America  Africa  Antarctica  the Indian subcontinent  and Australia were all joined in a single land mass called Gondwana  Southwestern Australia and the Cape Peninsula of South Africa were once near neighbors Darwin is equally convincing in the discussion of biostratigraphy   On The Geological Succession of Organic Beings    Why should we see a consistent pattern of fewer and fewer modern species  then fewer and fewer modern genera  fewer and fewer modern families  and so on  as we go down deeper into the fossil record  Why do these fossil forms show affinities to each other and to the creatures now living on top of them  Creationists try to explain biostratigraphy by means of two hypotheses from  flood geology    higher  organisms outran the  lower  ones from the increasing floodwaters  and hydrodynamic sorting explains the rest  But neither of these fit the facts  If marine fossils on mountains are supposed to be evidence for Noah s flood  why don t we find human fossils and artifacts in these same mountainous layers  Did the flower bearing plants  angiosperms  outrun the cone bearing plants  conifers   Did both outrun the ferns and mosses  And if hydrodynamic sorting explains the fossil record  why does it show the pattern of fewer and fewer modern species  genera  etc  as one goes further down  Have we all been getting smaller and lighter over history    including the blue whale  Why don t we see whale fossils mixed in with benthic  bottom dwelling  trilobites  Why do we see microfossils  pollen  diatoms  foraminifera  etc   exhibit the same patterns as the larger fossils when they re all roughly the same size and should have all floated to the top The number of issues evolution resolves but no other view can is simply astonishing when one begins to contemplate them  That was Darwin s argument and his key concern  He saw with tremendous clarity both what his own theory implied for the existing real world observations of naturalists and what they might accomplish for the natural sciences in the future  Here too he was ahead of his time because 150 years later we re still doing work  often in fields Darwin couldn t even conceive of  by using evolutionary principles  It s Darwin s world and we re just living in it  This has been a book that I ve wanted to read for a while  but had not previously taken the time to read  For years I ve read around Darwin s theory  but had never read the original text  I chose to read the second edition of the book  which had corrections from the first edition but was otherwise not substantially different from the first  This meant that I needed to go to the Darwin collected works website   http   darwin online org uk  to get the text  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in science or science education  In fact  even if you aren t interested in science  I would recommend Origin  It s a brilliant scientific work and presents one of the most important scientific theories ever devised  After I get a chance to go through the book again I will make some additional comments about the style and content of the book  For now I will just say that I m amazed at how many of his scientific deductions about the theory turned out to be so accurate given the limited amount of information he had in 1859  Charles Darwin  The Origin of Species  Barnes   Noble Classics  Copyright 2008  446 pages Although first published in 1859  Charles Darwin s The Origin of Species  captures his theory of evolution like no other scientific work to current date  scientifically describing natural selection  yet using language readable to non scientists  Backing his theory with natural evidence  observations  and the experiments and theories of other scientists  Darwin clearly demonstrates that evolution exists  despite the doubt many people possess  Also included in The Origin of Species are Darwin s theories on the Laws of Variation  the Struggle for Existence  Geographical Distribution  and Common Descent  all of which are organized in a way that logically explains evolutionary theory  The  struggle for existence  affects all organisms  as many more organisms exist than the resources needed to sustain them  so some organisms survive  but others die off  Competition constantly exists between organisms  and often those organisms who survive bear variations that are beneficial for survival  Natural selection preserves those beneficial variations in populations of organisms  thus allowing them to survive and procreate  After being slowly acted on by natural selection over an extensive period of many generations  the population with the beneficial variation evolves into a new species  Organisms without the beneficial deviation will most likely become extinct  as the organisms without the helpful deviation are often outcompeted by those who possess it  Geographical distribution  as well as natural selection  also determines how species will evolve  As demonstrated Darwin s theory of common descent  all species on earth descend from a single common ancestral species  Over time  the ancestral species  descendants migrate to other areas of the world  developing methods of transport required to overcome geographical barriers  which restrict the spread of species  as those who cannot overcome the barriers often become isolated from those who do  The isolation of species separates populations of organisms into different environments  and then natural selection will act on populations of organisms so that they are well adapted to survive in their particular environments  Populations which are geographically isolated from each other will evolve differently  as their environments differ from each other  A masterpiece work  The Origin of Species is one of the greatest scientific works to date  laying the foundation for modern biology  I absolutely love the book  as Darwin explains evolution in an instructive way  but also includes interesting stories of how evolution acts on animals and plants  so The Origin of Species is entertaining as well as informative  The Origin of Species  ability to explain evolution so thoroughly  yet so simply  is the book s greatest strength  Extraordinarily well written  Darwin s evolutionary classic is easily read by non scientists  as Darwin clearly explains all parts of his theory in simple terms  so background knowledge on evolution  although helpful  is not required to understand the book  In order to fully comprehend The Origin of Species  however  the reader needs some familiarity with nineteenth century English language  as the sentence structure is longer and more complex than contemporary English  Therefore  The Origin of Species should not be read by those who have yet to attend high school  as in high school students develop an understanding for nineteenth century English through their readings of complex English literature  I recommend that biology students or scientists in general should make it their goal to read The Origin of Species at least once  as it will provide them with fascinating scientific entertainment  Darwin supports most components of his arguments extremely well  backing them up with his observations  other scientific evidence  and plausible examples of evolution acting on organisms  but he admits that he cannot explain some parts of his argument  such as how complex organs develop from relatively simple organs  The fact that Darwin cannot support a few points of his argument is one of The Origin of Species  weaknesses  along with the fact the book does not cover the new knowledge that forms modern evolutionary theory  as it was written in the 1800s  a time period that did not have all of the modern technology that allowed for the formation of the contemporary theory of evolution  Despite its weaknesses  The Origin of Species remains an evolutionary masterpiece that should be added to any prolific reader s bucket list of books  for after all  it was so well written and informative that it caused Charles Darwin to become the most renowned natural biologist in history  Before getting into the book itself  I want to mention that I read the free Kindle version and it was fine with one minor exception  Darwin refers frequently throughout the book to a diagram in chapter 4 that is not reproduced in this version  However  he describes it so well that you can envision it in your mind  or you could easily sketch it What an amazing and courageous work  Now I can understand why he took so long to publish it  He spent years of field research on various plants  animals and geology trying to find every possible flaw in or argument against the theory of natural selection  and only published when he felt comfortable that every one of them could be explained or defeated  Of course it helped that Alfred Russell Wallace also came up with the same theory at about the same time  which further induced Darwin to publish rather than polish It was a surprise to me that in the entire first edition he never uses the word  evolution  nor the phrase  survival of the fittest  which I had mistakenly attributed to him and this work  He preferred the phrase  descent with modification  to evolution  although the last word of the last sentence is  evolved  At times he seemed agonizingly close to having an epiphane that would have led him to plate tectonics or at least a continental drift theory decades in advance of Waegner  If I somehow met Darwin today in a cosmic  time warp elevator between the past and the present  and only had a few minutes with him  that is probably one of things I would tell him about  What would you tell him   conspiratory voice Pssst    I didn t really read this  Don t tell anyone I mean  I read parts of it  I  sorta  looked into it  and read a little  and then looked into it again  and read a little more  But in all honesty  I can t say that I read this book  and it probably shouldn t be on my  read  shelf   only  where else would it go  certainly not on the to read shelf  since I have intention of actually reading it  So the read shelf it is   I mean   m not really supposed to  read  it  right  Not unless I decide to quit my job and study biology or something like that  right However  as an atheist and a someone who  believes  in evolution  like that has anything to do with belief      I felt that I needed to own it  And this copy was pretty and decently priced Plus  even without actually reading it  I can tell you that it is one of the most important books ever written  and I m really happy to have acquired a copy  The world needs more copies of this book  before someone gets it into their heads to ban it   I m looking at you  creatonists  points finger  Evolution by natural selection seems such a simple  logical and common sense idea  I d never actually got around to reading the book that first proposed the idea until now  I m certainly glad that I made the effort   even though some parts are hard going for somebody who is not a biologist or naturalist  most of the book is a meticulous and well written examination of a simple thesis  accessible to everyone  It s a very good example of popular science writing It opens with the observation that domesticated animals  using pigeons as a prime example  can be bred to enhance or eliminate certain physical characteristics or behavioural traits  An experienced breeder will note subtle differences from one generation to the next and select particular birds to produce the end result that he is looking for  Darwin s revelation was to realise that the same process occurs naturally  with populations controlled by limited resources  geography or other factors  and those creatures with characteristics best suited in the struggle for existence would be the ones to pass on their traits to their off spring Darwin spends many chapters looking for possible flaws and objections to his thesis  and answers just about every objection that modern creationists still like to cite  The scarcity of transitional forms  the gaps in the fossil records and the complexity of structures like the eye are all addressed in great detail  backed up by painstaking research carried out over many years  Darwin even went so far as putting seeds into the gullets of dead birds  floating them in water for several months and then germinating them to show how plants could spread to geographically isolated islands   one can only wonder at the reaction of his wife to finding bird corpses floating in tanks of water  He also followed ants around the English countryside to examine their various behaviours  picked up bird excrement  and most famously went on an arduous voyage on The Beagle to collect specimens and examine geology  The book also contains many examples of correspondences with naturalists from around the world providing evidence to back up his theory Looking at the  Origin  now  with the benefit of 150 years of hind sight reveals a few gaps in Darwin s knowledge  He knew nothing of continental drift  for example  which would have explained how certain populations of animals diverged at some points in the distant past  He also had no idea of the existence of DNA  which has now provided the most compelling and direct proof for the links between the various branches of the tree of life  The fossil record is also now much more comprehensive and better dated than in Darwin s day I can do no better as an example of his writing style than to quote the concluding paragraph of the book  It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank  clothed with many plants of many kinds  with birds singing on the bushes  with various insects flitting about  and with worms crawling through the damp earth  and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms  so different from each other  and dependent on each other in so complex a manner  have all been produced by laws acting around us  These laws  taken in the largest sense  being Growth with Reproduction  Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction  Variability from the indirect and direct action of the external conditions of life  and from use and disuse  a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life  and as a consequence to Natural Selection  entailing Divergence of Character and the Extinction of less improved forms  Thus  from the war of nature  from famine and death  the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving  namely  the production of the higher animals  directly follows  There is grandeur in this view of life  with its several powers  having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one  and that  whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity  from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been  and are being  evolved     How have all those exquisite adaptations of one part of the organisation to another part  and to the condition of life  been perfected  We see these beautiful co adaptations most plainly in the woodpecker and the mistletoe  and only a little less plainly in the humblest parasite which clings to the hairs of a quadruped or feathers of a bird  in the structure of the beetle which dives through the water  in the plumed seed which is wafted by the gentlest breeze  in short  we see beautiful adaptations everywhere and in every part of the organic world  All these results   follow from the struggle for life  Owing to this struggle  variations  however slight and from whatever cause proceeding  if they be in any degree profitable to the individuals of the species  in their infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to their physical conditions of life  will tend to the preservation of such individuals  and will generally be inherited by the offspring  The offspring  also  will thus have a better chance of surviving  for  of the many individuals of any species which are periodically born  but a small number can survive  Nothing is easier than to admit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life  or more difficult   at least I have found it so   than constantly to bear this conclusion in mind  Yet unless it be thoroughly ingrained in the mind  the whole economy of nature  with every fact on distribution  rarity  abundance  extinction  and variation  will be dimly seen or quite misunderstood  We behold the face of nature bright with gladness  we often see superabundance of food  we do not see or we forget  that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds  and are thus constantly destroying life  or we forget how largely these songsters  or their eggs  or their nestlings  are destroyed by birds and beasts of prey  we do not always bear in mind  that  though food may now be superabundant  it is not so at all seasons of each recurring year    After the first two chapters I asked   How could anyone question his conclusions   The arguments are so clear and the answers so obvious that you would have to be blind and deaf to not get the obvious conclusion that the world is more than 6000 years old and that God did not put everything on Earth just as we found it in the last 2000 years  Of course  those who are blinded by religious belief are deaf to the rational arguments of others  Thus  the argument goes on  I read this book just before and during a trip to the Galapagos  Unique island communities presented problems that prompted the thoughts which led Darwin to his theory of evolution  They are among the most influential places that Darwin visited in the Beagle on his around the world exploration  Anyone who has entered into an argument about evolution should read this book  It was great to be on these amazing volcanic islands and think about the implications of their flora and fauna  If this book seems too dense and too 19th century for your sensibilities  or your vocabulary   read the first three chapters  the summary of the fourth chapter and the last page and you ll get it  And look up the phrase   natura non facit saltum   before you read the book  it ll help you understand things better  js  HMS Beagle embarked for South America with Charles Darwin on board on May 11th in 1829  Thirty years later he published The Origin of Species where he began by laying out the main principles of his theory of natural selection in the early chapters  However  Darwin devotes most of the book to defending his theory against criticisms and presenting detailed examples of how natural selection occurs  The geological record is a formidable impediment to Darwin s theory  as the existing fossil record does not provide the  missing links  in the chains of descent that Darwin proposes  In response  Darwin argues that the geological record is imperfect and that many fossil remains have been destroyed by changes in the earth or have yet to be discovered Darwin also attempts to explain how variations occur in species  driving natural selection and the creation of new species  Geographical isolation is a key component of Darwin s theory  Darwin hypothesizes that because all species originated from one or a few original beings  species needed modes of transportation to migrate between geographical areas throughout the world  Barriers such as oceans and mountain ranges restrict the ability of organisms to migrate  and the few that manage to do so play a large role in shaping the evolution of species on islands and in geographically isolated areas  Geographical isolation accounts for the plethora of unique species on islands  as well as the wider distribution of species across continents Darwin s theory challenged not only the prevailing view of the independent creation of species but also larger claims of religion and science  Darwin explicitly denied the validity of natural theology  which posited that species  adaptations to their environments was proof of their  intelligent design  by a creator  It was natural selection  not independent creation  that resulted in these adaptations  Darwin argued  Moreover  Darwin s use of scientific methodology to prove his theory amounted to an explicit critique of naturalists who would attempt to ignore the scientific validity of his theory because of its controversial nature  While the text of The Origin of Species did leave room for religious theology  Darwin s overall commitment to scientific rationale rather than theological reasoning pitted him against religious doctrine  Darwin s text sold out on the day it was published in 1859 and created both friends and enemies of the theories discussed still to this day  There have been modifications of Darwin s theory of the origin of species  notably the Mendellian synthesis that incorporated genetics into the theory   but it stands to this day as the foundation of our understanding of the evolution  Surprisingly the only time evolution is specifically mentioned is in the last paragraph of the book This is a great book for anyone who wants to read a classic text of science  On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural SelectionWhat a book The way Darwin presents evidence or the lack of it  the way he identifies challenges to his theory and addresses them are a humbling example of scientific literature  By the subject matter and references given  it feels like Darwin wrote this with other naturalists in mind  It might by difficult for conventional readers such as me and a bit taxing in places  However the weight of the subject matter and the emancipation that follows will pull you through  Despite having written the book before the discovery of DNA or genetics  the accuracy of so much of its content is astonishing and speaks for the man s genius and his life s effort into the matter  The fossil record too is much more comprehensive now than it was in the 19th century This book exposes those who have endeavored before Darwin to attempt an answer to life  the universe and everything  with much arrogance  for the charlatans that they were  I may be a little biased  I love science   but On the Origin of Species is mind blowing  Not only are Darwin s ideas on natural selection revolutionary  but just the way he lays them out  It s hard for me to imagine reading Darwin at the time  but the way he structures his argument leaves little room for an alternative  when you break the process of natural selection down to its constituent parts it s just the way the natural world works  Even when Darwin s wrong  kin selection  other niche cases   he s nearly right  Without any knowledge of genetics  Darwin get s pretty close at reasoning out evolutionary cases we know to be true with copious  perhaps excessive observations  and reason  Everyone should read On the Origin of Species  It should be mandatory reading in schools   Yeah well 5 Stars  I could write all day on this one  I will just make a few observations  First off the whole way through this book I was thinking that if only modern science was this  Honest  when developing and testing theories  It seemed like Darwin wanted to be correct about his theory more than anything else so he was his own worst critic  He brought up harsh tests to his theory and tested the hell out of it  He also had good counters to other criticisms but praised them for making them  My impression of today s  Science  is a conclusion is striven for and experiments are all slanted in the direction of the desired outcome with no real tests  It is funding driven and political   Scientists should try to be like Darwin   I highlighted the be Jesus out of this book and he had some attitude towards his conclusions that will make one think hard on how they see the world  Amazing stuff  I knew it was going to be good but it was better than that  This is a book that changed the world history  Its not for me to review it  I wouldn t have even understood the text if I hadn t had read the latest of books on evolution  Darwin wrote a serious science treatise  much ahead of his time  Only those with a good foundation in natural history could have understood the implications of his suggestions  Now  150 years later  there are books available on the topic for the common man  Only because I had read the later books that I could easily follow the treatise by Darwin  Whatever was left untold by Darwin has found proof of science in the 150 years hence  For the layman it is the experience of reading a classic written in the mid 19th century that brings about all the thrill  I have read a book that changed the history of the world and I am happy It would be presumptuous for a common man like me to rate this great treasure of a book with 5 stars  Still I feel Darwin will pardon me for my reckless adventure   A tremendous and captivating read  A treasure of information packaged together after years of extensive research work  The Origin of Species is eye opening  It sharpens your mind expanding your knowledge base  It makes you to think about things that seldom attracted attention on the part of an ordinary reader  One may or may not agree with his theory of evolution  but the kind of work he produced is worth appreciation  The book does not only cover Darwin s years of research work  it brings together quality research conducted by several naturalists  botanists  geologists from different parts of the world  I would certainly love to read this book again as well as some of the other works by Charles Darwin  Superb  Amazing  Tantalizing  I am highly appreciative of his work  It is amazing that he produced this work in the middle of the 19th century after over two decades of research  It is not an ordinary effort  It is a contribution to mankind by a genius  Reading this book was a revelation  I am awed by Darwin s insight and his ability to figure out this complex phenomenon  Just amazing  I read this book as part of a college class many years ago  Since I knew it was going to take some time and concentration I dedicated two weeks of my winter break to it  reading for a few hours each day  I savored it  actually  and am glad I had the time to really pay it the attention it deserves  Those two weeks made me permanently in awe of Darwin  And made me want to be a scientist and describe my findings and hypotheses as clearly as he did  Some people have complained that this book is long and detailed and difficult to get through  Well  it is an original work of science from the 19th century  Not sure what else should be expected  As a scientist  I found it clearly written and not that hard to get through  But people should not compare to one of Malcolm Gladwell s books for entertainment value   Remarkable insight  As relevant as when it was first published given that the planet is changing and life is responding to those changes  both through extinction and adaptation Not particularly easy to read  very much written in the verbose style of its time  I imagine that level of detail was required to answer critics but it does make it a challenge to understand at times  Still  a must read for anybody interested in life on our Earth  Very interesting to see Darwin describe the original concept of evolution by natural selection  Our perspective has obviously grown much more sophisticated today  as even someone who is very much a layman like myself can recognize  Darwin did not even know of Mendel s who pioneered our understanding of genetics  although he was a contemporary of Darwin  no international internet archives to upload your stuff to at that time I suppose   So Darwin inevitable fell intro some flawed thinking  but also here he generally very wise  For example  If I remember correctly been some years since I read it in the earlier chapters  he states that he thought the mechanics of inheritance was the biggest gap of understanding in the theory So apart from the somewhat dry Victorian prose style  Darwin cracks few jokes and whatnot   it is still a great read if you are interested in getting some insight into how the theory of evolution got started  does my entire study life indicate the truth of our origin            or give me any clue               i really hv no idea      my medical studies also sometimes confusing    u kno  sm teachers says  look at the bacteria of AIDS    they can evolve rapidly       den sm people say look at ur eyes    can ya explain the funtion as smoothly without saying it must be created by sm 1 most powerful      origin if species  is still working with it      till now no scientific theory is not much reliable rather than evolution to me          the book never says bout our material of origin         it says the most possible way of origin        the variation of species must have a same root      human  a monkey or a rabit also hv a same root of a bush      it is called primet   then the branches are us           the book is in short     the ray of light in the end of a blocked black tunnel         it gives sm clues to think about         This is the original book by Charles Darwin  which highlights his thought process  and his theory on how animals adapt to their environment through genetics and heredity  It is considered the  foundation of evolutionary biology   However  in the book  Darwin states how he dislikes the word   Evolution   since it implied advancement  After all  not all changes that creatures exhibit due to environment are positive  Finally  the fact that Darwin was able to formulate the laws he did prior to the science of genetics is a tribute to his skills and to the science involved  It is a work that makes me proud to be a human being and grateful to Charles Darwin  Anyone who thinks evolution is incompatible with their religious beliefs should read this book and then realize that they have misunderstood the spirit of the portions of the Bible they believe conflict with Darwin s and science s great contribution to us  YAY for me  This is the hardest book I have ever read on my own and by my own choice  I actually started it two summers ago and hit a wall of incomprehension and school starting  Then last summer I was going to try again when the grandma  dad in law and cousin died and I could hardly focus on a magazine article in People  This summer it was  meant to be   I skimmed over the first 100 pages as a review and realized I had understood more than I thought  I then decided to read it through and get into Darwin s style of  sentences as long as a paragraph   his words  his ideas  his cadence and I really started to feel like I was understanding the concepts  I came up with an analogy  reading this book was like reading the Old Testament  Such novel concepts and wording that you really just have to immerse yourself in the experience in order to comprehend  Then  once you do  like me  you may just LOVE both   5 stars in the  it s a classic  sense more than the  I loved it  sense  Finally I can put this on my  read it  shelf  Darwin s writing is clear if not the most engaging  Clearly the guy was a genius considering that nothing was known of the mechanisms of genetics or continental drift  I put his scientific insight up there with absolutely anyone else The fact that he studied decomposing birds as a means of possible dispersion of plants and invertebrates to distant lands is just science at its best  It s well known that Darwin wated decades from his own personal insight of natural selection  It is clear he had to do a LOT of research to provide a mountain of evidence when he was finally ready to share his theory with the world  There are better introductions to evolution now and many of them but  considering my profession  I really felt I needed to go to the original source and I m glad I did   Bearing in mind that this is more a scientific paper rather than a book for the masses  this is an excellent read  This is obviously a book that changed the way we look at the world  and although much of what is says had been suggested before  it marks the first time that a thorough treatise on the theory of evolution had been published  Even the obvious errors that Darwin makes   the whales did not evolve from bears and he overestimates the time of erosion of the Weald by a factor of five   do not diminish from the fact that Darwin pretty much nailed evolution within these pages  What makes this all more incredible was that the mechanism of inheritance  genetics  the structure of DNA and plate tectonics were all unknown to Darwin  but are important in understanding the theory properly  If any book out there is essential reading  it is this one  even more so in this year  the 150th anniversary of its first edition  Darwin puts forth his arguments for evolution by natural selection in this seminal work  Until reading this book  and his Voyage of the Beagle  see below   I hadn t appreciated what an excellent writer he was  He builds his arguments first from well accepted modifications of domesticated species  e g   sheep  pigeons  horses  flowers  that have resulted from human selection of certain favored traits  He then introduces the notion of natural selection to explain how such modifications occur in nature and presents many corroborative observations from his and other scientists empirical work  I also liked that he was very honest about putting forth observations and arguments that seem to run counter to his theory  He then speculates how such observations could arise from natural selection over the course of many generations  Reader be warned  some of the chapters  e g   the one on hybrids  are extremely dry   Grasping one by the hand Darwin  in a grandfatherly fashion  leads the reader gently through the great mountain of evidence that abounds in this treatise  especially about pigeons    It may be said that all of evolutionary science in the century and a half since  The Origin  has been to simply reaffirm and reassert the compelling arguments laid out by Darwin  anyone who has read Richard Dawkins  or the like will discover that the latter writers propose very little that is not first treated by Darwin  rather choosing to give examples that Darwin was unaware of  Dawkins s example of the neck of a giraffe as a startling example of natural selection being my personal favorite on the subject   My only complaint being that his sentences are too long and the benefit  in respect to clarity  from briefer ones would greatly aid the unscientific reader who is perhaps approaching these concepts for the first time    There is grandeur in this view of life  with its several powers  having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one  and that  whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity  from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been  and are being  evolved  A seminal work and greatly influential on me personally  both in fostering my love of science and in guiding my career as a scientist  I reread Origin every few years and find wonder anew each time  I strongly recommend the first edition  despite it s flaws  it contains the purest form of Darwin s theories  which were somewhat adulterated in response to criticisms for the later versions  especially the sixth  Harvard University Press has a wonderful facsimile of the first edition  with an introduction by Ernst Mayr  that is well worth the extra couple of dollars you ll spend on it  This took me awhile to read because while the first five chapters and final summary are beautiful  the rest of the book is harder reading  There Darwin meticulously addresses all kinds of potential problems with his theory  including most of the ones creationists still use today  which can be tedious at times  though I recognize how important that level of detail is  All thinkers should follow Darwin s example by recognizing and responding to the weaknesses of their pet ideas as he did  That said  the  difficult  chapters are very rewarding to read and shouldn t be skipped on a first reading if possible  there are all kinds of awesome turns of phrase and argumentation in there  If you are ideologically opposed to Darwin and have never actually read him  I encourage you to do so  He probably already anticipated your complaint and answered it herein 150 years ago  FOKIN  DARWIN Es de esos libros que quieres que todo el mundo lea  Como la Biblia para los cristianos  En verdad dice muchas cosas que uno  cree  que entiende  pero cuando lo llevas a detalle te das cuenta de lo complicado que es el proceso de nuestra existencia y  de cierta manera  el rol que tenemos con este principio  Seleccion Natural   Es medio complicado de leer si  como yo  no estas acostumbrado a leer este tipo de literatura y temas  Usa terminos y se explica facil pero a veces se empieza a meter mucho a explicar una cosa en especifico y no se detiene a detalles  supone que entiendes de que habla cuando la persona comun no entenderiamos  Desde su modo de analizis  hasta su forma narrativa todo lo hace bien  s buen cientifico biologo y es buen escritor  Lo venden barato en cualquier lugar  siempre hay una edicion barata  MUST READ The Origin of Species is a brilliant book by Charles Darwin  about the where species originated from  Darwin gives his own theory on where he believes that natural selection is what causes evolution  In this book it mentions about the Malthusian argument stating that while population growth is expediential while food growth is linear  This basically states that eventually there will not be enough food for everyone so only the stronger species will live  Darwin adds on to this that there could never reach infinite growth of population due to not enough natural resources and because of geography  I found this book to be absolutely amazing and super interesting  It really opens your eyes to a different perspective  This is certainly different than any other type of book I have read  but I loved it   It is absolutely genius and I recommend it to anyone  What can one say about what is probably the most important book of the modern era  I found it surprisingly charming and accessible  in spite of the buckets of detail on pigeons and ants and various flora with which I am unfamiliar  Or maybe because of all that detail  and his regular apologies for not having room present his copious evidence more completely  It was possible to skim a lot of the detail  because he presents his key points in highly quotable pithy statements  It is alternately remarkable that he managed to understand evolution so well  given how little  read  nothing  was understood about the mechanisms of genetics at the time  and astonishing that the ideas he was presenting were anything but obvious  Not an easy read  but delightful P S  No  the   Origin of Species  not Origin of the Species  Quite apart from its scientific importance  this is a beautifully written book that begs the question why scientists today are so much less literate  by and large  than their nineteenth century predecessors  Darwin was an avid reader of his contemporaries  such as George Eliot and Charles Dickens  and it shows  Just look at the famous opening lines   When on board HMS Beagle  as naturalist  I was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of South America       These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species   Who can fail to be sucked in and want to read on  The fact that natural selection is probably the most important scientific discovery of all time is simply a bonus This review applies to the first edition  which is the best exposition of Darwin s ideas  This is something I absolutely love  but wouldn t recommend to any of my friends  it s something I can read over and over as a science geek  but it wouldn t translate to the  normal  population because it reads almost like a textbook  It s not really a story  more a collection of experiments and discoveries  which fascinate me  but wouldn t give anyone else the woody I get from it  The way one of the most incredible evolutionarily biologists of all time made his controversial hypotheses and came to his conclusions makes me wet just thinking about it  He was WAY ahead of his time and could have been killed for writing  for even thinking  these things 150 years ago  and that makes it all the more intense  Plus  how genius was he to choose the Galapagos for his research  it s like a paid vacation   There s no sense in reviewing this  it s the seminal work on which all of our accounting of biological diversity rests on  yadda yadda yadda A few striking things 1  The breadth and depth of knowledge that Darwin brings together into one book to drive home his point is simply astounding 2  Most arguments of intelligent design advocates creationists wackjobs were already obliterated by this book in 1859  I wish they d read it 3  The gaps in Darwin s understanding of evolution  most specifically the mechanisms of genetic inheritance  have since been explained through further scientific inquiry  Thus  it s fun to read his doubts and speculations and think  oh  I can explain that  since I took high school biology   4  It s pretty stupid I waited this long to read this book  He is a genius and was able to understand and relate better to my biology class because I read this book  I appreciate science and though I say this wasn t a book I could curl up by the fire and really indulge and enjoy  I still had a wonderful experience and I hope to not forget the information   You really can t talk about The Origin of Species if you haven t read the book  What impressed me the most was the incredibly meticulous  careful  methodical research and observations he describes  There s very little to argue with here  that may surprise people who haven t actually read it    There have been a few works of non fiction that have been on my TBR pile for years and this year I finally read Charles Darwin s brilliant work  As I read the book I was constantly reminded of how amazing the mind of Mr Darwin really was  As a science enthusiast and hopefully a future scientist I had been brought up on the works of Darwin therefore the ideas he presented not only seemed practical however I am always startled to a stop when I was reminded that Darwin had come up with his deductions with no knowledge of the basic human building blocks  genetics  Despite this Darwin was startlingly close to the hidden secrets of genetic inheritance  I only wish that Darwin and Gregor Mendel had had met and maybe just maybe the future might have looked just that little bit different   This book is fascinating on many levels  The main subject  on species  is seemingly covered from every angle  Darwin covers variation under domestication and nature  Malthusian theory of population  instinct  and even embryology and anatomy  Also he was a good geologist and paleontologist  In addition  the secondary story of the voyage of the Beagle is a great adventure and gives context to the main work  Historically  it is interesting and surprising to learn how much was known about the natural world in 1859  Also it is interesting learn about Darwin the man through his words  Personally  he was simultaneously humble  giving credit to many others for their work  and competitive  wanting to be the first with his theory  It is a testament to hard work that he put so much together  The first truly great science book written for the people  There were other people who were sorting out how evolution works but Darwin put out his book first and explained it in a way that many could understand  His explanation of the three mechanisms that drive evolution  Natural  Sexual and Artificial Selection  are brilliant and his  prophecies  on what we should find after he published this work have been found true  Much has been added to the overall theory but it stands as testament to a life s work and as the most backed and supported theory in the realm of science  There are those who sadly do misunderstand his work and even worse misrepresent it in a backhanded and dishonest way to attempt to discredit it as it contradicts their beliefs but it remains the cornerstone of biology  I like science and love to experiment  so I was interested by this book because it was written by one of the greatest scientists ever  I ve always been interested in the topic of Evolution and the controversies with religion  This book interested me more when I learned about the Theory of Evolution  stated by Darwin himself  I felt like this book would be an expansion and a broader explanation of this topic  And in fact it was  This book talks about survival of the fittest and natural selection  two of my favorite scientific topics  I gave this book five stars because it was all based on research and information recollected by Darwin  I feel like this book is a very reliable source and is very inspiring as well  for it encourages any one to do research in what one is interested   If you re a science major it is a must read  It s honestly not as boring as you d think for a book that was made in 1859  I gave it 5 stars because it is a major cause the basis of thinking in biology and if you don t believe in evolution then you should probably pick another major If you like nineteenth century prose and biology   grand sweeping biology   then this is a must read  I originally read this book because I had been convinced that creationism was a litgetimate challenger to normal biological theories   I know  I know  creationism challenges ALL scientific theories   I decided that I had to read the book so I would have a working knowledge of it anytime a conversation was struck on the topic of evolution  As it turned out  everything I had heard about it from christians was a complete lie It should be noted that as far as biology goes  this book is out of date  There are better primers on evolution than this  such as Carl Zimmer s book on evolution  If you want to see Darwin s original theory  and his stunning genius  read this book  A surprisingly excellent read  So much more dynamic   both biologically and politically   than you would think with all the hearsay and gossip about the trajectory of Darwin s argument  Its humbling to confront the biological side of humanity in this way and to really think about humans as simply another form of life alongside trees and frogs  birds and mushrooms  Because while there is a struggle for survival  and humans think they ve won  when you understand that it is not only the species  but the struggle itself that is in constant evolution it seems to me not really a struggle you can win at all but simply an eternal struggle in which certain species will dominate for a time until they get debunked by another species or by larger forces of Nature itself   What is not well understood is what an approachable and engaging writer Darwin was  If you are expecting a boring scientific tome   be prepared for a pleasant surprise  The book is very accessible to the modern reader  and relatively timeless in its relevance   I was always hesitant to read this book for fear of the Victorian writing style   so this abridged version was an excellent compromise  Throw in that it s read by Richard Dawkins   and there is no excuse in the world that everyone should not read  or listen  to this book Listening to the familiar ideas that Darwin introduces in this book and that are still of intense research  interest  and importance says much about how legendary of a thinker he was  I have read many books on evolution before this and it was intriguing to see many of the ideas were first brought up by Darwin   much like realizing that many of the songs you heard on the radio turned out to be Beatle songs  Anyway   amazing how this books stands the test of time   over 150 years later   Thus  from the war of nature  from famine and death  the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving  namely  the production of the higher animals  directly follows   There is grandeur in this view of life  with its several powers  having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one  and that  whiles this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity  from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been  and are being  evolved     Charles Darwin  The Origin of Species It s quotes like this one that show what an amazing book this is  The science is wonderful but the way it is stated is no less beautiful than some of the classic Victorian novels of the time  One of those books that you should read before you die  While subsequent editions of the Origin of Species diverged greatly from the first  but interestingly  it is Darwin s first formulation of the theory that is closest to our modern understanding of evolution  Contrary to the title  the book only discusses species  origins by inference  a logical conclusion of the theory  Ultimately  the book boils down to a likelihood argument  pitting evolution by natural selection against the theory of special creation  In the process  Darwin addressed every major concern that modern evolution naysayers have ever posed  For all their bellowing about the problems of Darwin s argument  you d think they would have actually read it  It took me years to get around to read the whole thing rather than snippets  It s an amazing piece of work  Evolution is obvious when you read this book  you have to ask yourself  like Huxley  why didn t I think of this  There is grandeur in this view of life  with its several powers  having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one      from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been  and are being  evolved  To be perfectly honest I have not read this book all the way through    not remotely  The reason I gave it a 5 star rating is the historical importance of this book and that it is beautifully written  It is well argued with a wealth of detailed evidence  There must be thousands of reviews written about this book  some very eloquent and learned but for the average reader I would say this is a book worth having on your shelf and pulling down every now and then to browse through  Unless you are very interested in evolutionary theory or work professionally in this field I think it would be a tall order to read it from start to finish   unless you have excellent powers of concentration   which I don t  I wasn t quite sure what I expected from this book  but I finished feeling that the author had made a persuasive case for microevolution  that is  white rabbits will probably survive better in a snowy environment that dark colored rabbits  This is admitted by most as intraspecies variation  rather than a new species  He admits that the lack of fossil remains of intermediate forms is a problem  and I m not sure I understand his argument that supposedly mitigates this problem  I also got the impression that the author was a believer in God and that his scientific investigations caused him some significant conflict with his faith  I m very glad I read it  and I recommend it  especially to believers  I was somewhat skeptical about reading this book  It was so long ago  so much more research has been done  the theory has been elucidated  clarified  progressed This book is a masterpiece  It is one of the best constructed arguments I have ever read  The thoroughness  the abundance of supporting evidence  the range of disciplines explored all make this an exceptional piece of work that should be required reading for  at the very least  every biology student  and probably anyone interested in how to construct and present an idea   Here you can read my impression of this book The Origin Of Species By Means Of Natural Selection by Charles Darwin  c  1859 http   swsbooks blogspot com 2014 06     There are only a handful of books that you can argue have truly changed the world  but this is definetly one of them For centuries  scientists and philosophers alike had been able to point out the gigantic flaws in the argument for the existence of God  without being able to come up with an alternative solution themselves  Thanks to Darwin  the truth of how we really got here has been explained  it s just a pity that so many people fail to understand Darwinian natural selection  dismissing it as  random chance  which as Richard Dawkins   The Selfish Gene points out  this is certainly far from the case A must for any advocate of evolution  or anyone who still believes in magic  One of most important works ever written  It is sad  bordering on absurd  that 150 years after Darwin s genuinely pardigm shifting explanation of natural selection and species evolution  that fewer than half of the US population believe in evolution  This is akin to not  believing  in gravity  And  of the half that do accept the truth of evolution  I would venture to say that half of them misunderstand it to be a teleological process toward higher perfection  rather than a drive toward diversity and ongoing adaptability  A course on evolutionary biology should be required in every high school with  On the Origin of Species  and Richard Dawkins    The Selfish Gene  as required readings  Origin of Species is the most important book of the past two hundred years  presenting the most important and impactful idea since Copernicus Galileo Newton concept of the cosmos  A truly revolutionary book  It is remarkable how much Darwin got correct  Read Coyne or Prothro or Dawkins or Eugenie Scott if you want to know modern evolutionary theory  I would agree with the statement that Origin of Species is the most important book ever written  period  It is not a  must read  per se as evolutionary science has filled in a vast mosaic of the details of natural selection and alternative processes  but Origin should be appreciated for its historical significance   This isn t an easy read    long stretches on how glaciers facilitated migration of seeds  for example    but it is a fascinating experience to follow this carefully assembled argument  It is hard to imagine how outlandish the concept would have seemed in the 1850s and also how poorly many have understood Darwin s work  I have a hard time conceiving how anyone could read this and still believe in Creation    More people should read the Origin  or big chunks of it  if you ask me  It is totally worth the read  There are definitely some slow bits  but other parts are great  It s pretty amazing how right on the mark he was so with much of it  The bible in nature science  same as the Holy Bible  made a huge influence on me  I strongly recommend it to all my friends  especially in China where few people possess a clear belief in the life time  The struggle between scientific minds of Charles Darwin and the prevailing views about creation in public had an incredible pressure upon him and his family  Even though he modified several words and description in the second edition of The Origin which was published couple of months after the first one  the idea that God creates the world and makes every living thing in the nature never wins Charles  approval  I admire his courage and rigorous logic thinking   Surprisingly easy to read master piece of scientific writing  Brings up and addresses numerous  problems  with the theory of evolution in an excellent way  Though I knew better  I think  given an evangelical background  I originally expected to open up this book and find the devil  I did certainly expect a dry  dusty scientific tome What I found was a beautifully written  exquisitely reasoned celebration of life on earth from a man who was not denying a Creator  but who was offering an alternative point of view by which the Creator might have made his Creation  Darwin is very careful to be respectful of God  he himself was an Anglican who is buried in Westminster Abbey   and his enthusiasm for creation is evident in every passage  an enthusiasm which makes this an incredibly readable work  I registered a book at BookCrossing com http   www BookCrossing com journal 12700912 This book is such a monolith from the 19th century that I was astounded to find it written in clear  simple and engaging language   lw kn l qly fm km lm dty ltmnyt n  lthm hdh lktb df   wHd klh nqT  nqT  dkhl  qly  n m hna fta  mhws  b lm l Hy mndh fTrth  This is such an insightful book  Darwin covers a lot of ground  discusses so many aspects that support his theory  and handily deals with specific complaints arguments against the theory  many of which  you still hear today  While in some areas  it is interesting to see Darwin struggle for answers  answers that modern science has largely provided us with today  and yet  for the majority of the book  he is thorough and specific  It is great to read something by such a great mind  and I think this is an important book for everyone  if not to read completely  to at least study and understand the specific concepts involved  Excellent book  Easily accessible  Clear writing style Darwin is absolutely worthy of the fame that he still has up to this day  and the next time some religious folks want to criticize the man or his reasoning  ask them for the EXACT QUOTE  which page  which line  that they are saying that they disagree with  Darwin supplies dozens of examples that show subtle adaptation and help to suggest that his theory is correct This is a book that everyone should read  especially folks from religious backgrounds that believe all of the creatures on this planet didn t evolve to fit into their current place in the world  If you love biology  history  research  and science  this is a wonderful view into the origin of today s scientific approach  Reading this book carefully is a long task  but enlightening  Darwin s scientific argument is multifaceted and excellently laid out   If you re somebody who likes to know another point of view of human evolution of one of the greatest botanical history  Strikingly modern  One of the few Ur texts that I would recommend that everybody read  Clear  Straightforward   It started out great  but got a little boring in the middle  but a book that should be in everyones home  This is one book all scientists should read  regardless whether they re in the field of biology or not  Once past the dry  dedicated tone  it is easy to see how meticulous  methodological and mercilessly Darwin tackles the questions of the origin of the diversity of life  Even though he lacks the understanding of biology we have today  he nevertheless makes a solid point while answering many of the critiques brought up  The sheer number of experiments show his dedication to understanding an underlying truth of nature  And that is something to be looked up to by all scientists  regardless of field  Grab this and the Bible and Elegant Universe and you have all you need  Hell throw in Walden  Lol  I love Darwin  his theory and his books  I do not need to explain why I gave this 5 star rating  This book blew me away  I thought that perhaps since the ideas of evolution were in there infancy in his day that naive notions would be rather prevalent  I could not have been further from the truth  This is a very intellectually stimulating read and is still very much relevant to today s reader   When I view all beings not as special creations  but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Silurian system was deposited  they seem to me to become ennobled  Charles Darwin  On the origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection  p  306 Simple and elegant yet astonishing and miraculous  Darwin teaches us how to be good scientists   It s amazing to find a book that presents such an incredible application of logic to the natural world that it still makes good reading 150 years later  Darwin uses the power of words to persuade the layman of the correctness of his theory of natural selection  As the theory is presented to people of his time  I came away with a picture of how people in the Western world viewed science in the mid 1800s  One of my recent professors in anthropology recommended I read this book  and I have to thank her for helping me to finally take this book off the shelf after 40 years and read it  Absolutely fascinating especially when you know it was written so long ago  more people need to read this to get a grasp on what evolution really is  Excelente  Impresiona lo revolucionario que es el pensamiento de Darwin que vino a cambiar por completo la concepcion de la biologia  Sin demeritar sus logros  es definitivamente es una lectura densa  con muchos terminos cientificos y un tanto repetitiva   While this is out of date by 150 years and information such as the existence of DNA  the vehicle of heredity  was not known   the observations and evidence accumulated in this book are surely timeless  Anyone wanting to understand the fundamentals of Evolutionary Theory without being too perturbed by the complexities of modern biological and geological sciences should start off with this beautifully crafted book of basics  I guarantee if you take the time to look at it  really look at it  it will transform your worldview  I m excited for anyone embarking on this journey  An average rating of 3 9 out of five  Lol  This was the most important work of biological science  It is also well written and engaging  If you find it hard going  read the final chapter  which is a recapitulation of Darwin s arguments  It was surprisingly easier to read than I thought it would be  Darwin gives an excellent explanation of natural selection so that even a non scientist can comprehend it   Very interesting  I recommend to go to the first edition A remarkable work  Darwin might have been a naturalist and a scientist by training  but I have no doubt that it was his consummate writing style which enabled his theory to survive its initial trial of fire  You really get a sense  in reading each detail and example  about the patient genius of Darwin as he spent many a year exhaustively pondering  corresponding  and working out a logical and consistent framework behind evolution  I would recommend the 1st edition  as subsequent editions were softened to become more palatable to his adversaries   This remains one of my favourite books  not science books  but books in general  of all time  It is definitely worth while to get this edition  Others are sometimes abridged  or maybe taken from one of Darwin s earlier editions  The great thing about the final edition is that Darwin was able to explain things more clearly  by responding to the criticisms of the prior editions Everyone should read this book  The thought process  and the simplicity of it all  makes the theory of natural selection one of the greatest scientific theories to date  Fantastisch boek  Zeer goede spreker      The issue I find most difficult as far as evolotionary theory by random mutation is in wondering if there really has been enought time  Darwin dealt intelligently with this issue  however I still have reservations as in fact does increasingly  the scientific community  epigenetics etc   I could never understand why people felt Darwin and Lamarck are opposed and if you read this book you will find they personally were not  at least not Darwin to Lamarck  Darwin writes extremely well and proves himself to be a scientist of the first calibre  Darwin detailed his theory of evolution in this book  Using many examples and facts  he illustrated that over long periods of time  species would diversify  and the bets varieties would thrive  becoming new species  and supplanting their ancestors  His book  though certainly written for contemporary naturalists  still resonates with truth today  The points he uses to prove his theory are still used today  Darwin revealed to humanity how we have came to be through this book  I finished I was inspired to read this on a trip to the Galapagos  Overall  I m amazed with how Darwin was able to clearly express his ideas  I had no idea he was so into pigeons  There are obviously some points that he makes that differ from current thought  but that is to be expected  I kept trying to imagine how he would react to what we now know today  My only point of contention is that he kept refer to this as an abstract  In my mind an abstract is 500 words or less  I can t imagine reading  or writing  the full work    This book is brilliant  I was awed over and over again at how detailed Darwin gets when trying to support his cause  Having previously read Charles and Emma made this book even more enjoyable because I really understood all the trouble Darwin went to in order to conduct his experiments  I recommend this book for everyone  whether they are interested in science or not  It is important to understand a theory before you support or bash it  I also suggest that you get this book on audio  because otherwise it is a boring read     Even if you do not marvel at how Darwin weaves his stitching across time  species and continents  you can not help but be enthralled in how he presents his case to the world  Not many people can so seamlessly integrate biology  geology  philosophy and ecology  He builds his argument one brick at a time  while constantly testing his structure against the winds of critics  religion and the public  Darwin is clearly more than a scientist  he is a pioneer  determined to shake past conventions and challenge the common view   Great audiobook version  As a Scientist  a Biologist  and a lover of all things nature  I believe this is singlehandedly the most important collection of bound paper anyone could ever own  Not only was Darwin s findings a Scientific phenomenon  but they also sparked a revolutionary change in the idea of religion  Sadly  the idea of evolution is still challenged today by creationists  which is why I believe it is essential that anyone wishing to study within the Scientific community have the opportunity to read and study Darwinian ideas   This book no doubt informs the reader of the theory of natural selection from one of the most brilliant of minds  What Darwin knew about and belived in a time when so many others were ignorant to the obvious was unbelivable  I found the book itself hard to read and had to recap over a few pages now and again because the type of english used was old fashoned  which is to be expected of course  It is definitly a must read for all who wish to know anything about Darwin s theory which revolutionised the study of evolution   This is a great edition of this work  containing the whole of the third edition  which is the same as the first edition with typos and grammar fixed  it is the sixth edition that is all muddled from other people convincing DArwin to change this and that resulting in a less historically significant and frankly weakened text  Also this edition includes excepts from much of the important literature that influenced Darwin and his audience  and that came in response to the text  A gem of a book and reasonably priced  Just   WOW  A seminal book but dated  Reading this again but slower this time  It was a lot of fun to read it after reading an article in National Geographic March 2011 called Taming the Wild  Hidden in all animals is the code to make them tame  cute and cuddly or some other thing that would be useful or domestic  There was also another great article in The Nation Geographic Feb 2009 called What Darwin didn t know that is a good companion read for this book  As a work of genius it of course deserves five stars  although as a book for the general reader  it may be found a little too detailed  In fact I m flabbergasted by Darwin s extraordinary command of detail and the care with which he attends to every possible objection to his theory  often acknowledging where it may seem weak  Weak or not  as a theory it is of course clearly hugely more convincing than the main other competing theory  that of creationism  for which evidence seems to be based only on hearsay   This is probably the most enlightening book I ve ever read  Given that the text was first published over 150 years ago it s arguments are still a very compelling view of evolution vs  the concept of creationism  He starts by describing something with which we can all relate  domestic selection  then applies some of those principles to the natural world  I already felt that evolution was the correct answer to our beginnings but this book adds so much detail and color to the concept it s hard to put down  One of the greatest scientific books published due to Darwin s easy to understand yet in depth writing style  As far as scientific value goes  Darwin does what any good scientist would do  he backs up his ideas with multiple experiments and the experiments of others  both of which are present in the book  Seeing as most of Darwin s ideas have held up to modern experiments  some of which have even observed evolution via natural selection in action   Darwin truly deserves to be considered a great scientist  Incredible book  gives an idea of where we realy come from Bedrock  There s better books to read if a person wants to understand evolution by natural selection  Many modern authors  particularly Dawkins  have provided the public with unparalleled works reinforcing Darwin s prized theory  Evidence from genetics simply didn t exist in Darwin s time  and genetics is truly the key to understanding natural selection  However  this being the book that started it all  providing implications abound for both philosophy and the natural sciences  it deserves the five stars  Surprisingly relevant for such an old book  Darwin humbly explains the reasons and evidence for the theory of gradual modification by natural selection  presenting also the difficulties and challenges  All this with a sparse fossil record and no knowledge of DNA  Subsequent research and newly discovered evidence have continued to bear out the truth of his theory  I have read much more recent accounts of Evolution  but I am glad that I took this chance to read this seminal work that began it all  mn S b lqrrt lt  y yyn  tkhdhh hw qrr ltwqf  n qr  ktb m w dm  kmlh

finally read this  I ve read lots of modern books about evolution  but had never read the seminal book on the subject  It is beautifully written and very persuasive  I loved the way that  toward the end of the book  he says he doesn t expect to change many minds in his own time  but that he hopes future naturalists who are not biased towards creationism will accept his views  As humble as he was he admits in the book that his idea is revolutionary  What a guy  I can t believe it took me this long in my life to finally read this book  While I ll admit that portions were a bit dry  all in all Origin was a wonderful read  I loved reading about some of the experiments that he personally did while refining his theory  and his prose occasionally turned poetic and quite beautiful  Put into context  and considering the influence that this book has had on our understanding of life on our planet  it is hard to walk away after reading not in awe  Superlative book  especially for its time I don t see a conflict religion  To me God is The Creator and I believe that HE has a process for everything  and that we are greatest the limiters of our own understanding This does not diminish my belief in God  it enhances it  Not everything in the Bible is  literal   For example  if  days are literal  why did he wait to create the sun and the moon until the third day  Then again if you don t believe in God its still a great read  This was a difficult read  largely due to the language of the time  but an enjoyable one  This book provides the best  longest and most varied studies into evolution and details the findings and conclusions of these in a coherent manner  once you get past the differences in language   This is a must read not just for those with an interst in biology ecology but also those with an interest in religion and philosophy as you can how Darwin was torn between his beliefs and his science The single most controversial text since the mid 1800s  the author the doppelganger of every philosopher or alchemist burned at the stake during the renaissance Until its writing the earth was considered a few thousand years old  all species unchanging and divinely crafted  but now today we know better Probably the most banned book of all time  dividing the educated from the sub neanderthal intellects of the world Might be the most important scientific work in human history  listening to the audio version this time The last time I began reading this book  was before our honeymoon to Ecuador  when I really wanted to visit the Galapagoes  but apparently the Beagle was a lot cheaper to travel on and  frankly  I didn t want to inject my amorphous DNA into some protazoa who was just trying to enjoy their beach home This time is different  back in the USA  while good old boy Darwin  tells me how cool Pigeons are as pets  as if I didn t already envy that  Ahhh   what more can be said about this groundbreaking book  This book marks the beginning of the explanation for the diversity of life on this planet and while Darwin could have never known about genetics  his overall postulations were dead on and he has been vindicated time and time again over the last 150 years  Though  for those interested in learning about the modern evidence for evolution in laymen s terms  I would highly suggest Dawkins   The Greatest Show on Earth   Vale  no es para todo el mundo  Pero si te lo tomas sin prisa y sabiendo lo que es  es uno de los mejores libros sobre ciencia que se pueden leer  No es solo que la prosa de Darwin es ligera  con cierto sentido del humor  y de una humildad deliciosa de encontrar  es que ver explicado con tanta claridad y sencillez el descubrimiento cientifico mas importante de la edad moderna  la evolucion de las especies por seleccion natural  es un privilegio que merece la pena disfrutar   I was and am still reading a variourum text with all editions of Origin  The  geniuos  of Darwin is that he was able to convince the science of  evolution  and that it s mechanism was natural selection  It is one of the most astounding stories of the nature of the world we live in  a fantastic story  which we are the product of  Darwin cannot be read without the epistemological view  so  keep nearby your Canguilhem  Foucault  Deleuze  Derrida  Sarasin etc  Dr  Darwin is a three star author at best  but is surely a ten star scientist  If you re looking for a consuming story with twists  turns  and drama  this certainly isn t the book for you  However  if you seek to understand the life on this planet  this book is a must  Many of the theories have been updated and augmented with modern evidence and technology  but reading the foundational work on evolution is paramount in understanding biology today   What can I say about Darwin and his contemporaries  Time has been the great witness to their theories  Those with eyes to see  see the world explained  Even those who don t  can t explain their theories away  Darwin s logic opened the universe to my mind  It amazes me that they did their work by observation  Time has given us many tools to confirm their work  Some ideas fell away  almost all are still valid  One of the great accomplishments of our species You would be hard pressed to find a finer essay than this  Not only is it important for how we see ourselves within the animal world  but it is written for anyone to follow without effort  At a comfortable pace Darwin allows you to discover the process by which life became so diverse and leaves you able to answer any question about the physical  mental  and social characteristics of all life on this planet Deserving of 5 stars   This book is not an easy read  but it is very worthwhile  Darwin builds his argument for evolution with example after example gathered from decades of observation and scientific experimentation  At the very least  you marvel at how much Darwin was able to deduce using very basic scientific tools and the scientific method  At the most  you can read between the lines and be aware of the scientific revolution that is about to begin  A long long book  Chock full of experiments and observations and a long long repetitive argument repeatedly demonstrating amazingly all the principles of evolution by natural selection that Darwin had discovered and analyzed for years before publishing I read most of it when I was still in college  though not for a class  I had 50 pages left that I finally finished almost 10 years later just to completely finish it  Whatever opinions you may hold because of culture religion or other beliefs there is an acceptance that this book completely the way mankind thinks about himself  You may not agree with Darwin s findings but nothing has ben the same since it was published  A must read even though it ain t always easy Curiosity note  Darwin s wife was a daughter of the Wedgewood family famous for its china ware all over the world   Beautifully written    Fascinating book to read  although with the knowledge one posesses now of evolution and genetics  it could be considered a difficult read  I say this because Darwin writes in such a way as to convince the reader that evolution is a fact  if you already believe it and have at least a basic understanding of evolutionary biology then you don t need convincing A highly reccommendable read regardless  I must say  Te hace reflexionar a cerca tu alrededor y cuestionarte de como las especies han llegado a ser lo que son  todo soportado con evidencias  Any rating below 5 stars would feel completely wrong  Arguably one of the most influential books ever written  Darwin was indeed a genius  While the book itself can be dry and sometimes hard to get through  the impact that this book had on this planet is incredible and I truly believe that this IS a book we should ALL read at some point in our lives  whether you re interested in science or not   It s taken me a while to get through this  I feel the content of this book is so important and fundamental to modern life  both socially and scientifically  that it is almost disrespectful to some ideas of reality for it to be dismissed so easily  I won t claim to understand the deeper workings of evolution but having a developed insight gives me a feeling of a more profound and sturdy opinion of life   Five stars for the sheer simplicity and elegance of the theory  Darwin s observations are detailed  but it is his ability to see patterns  similarities and differences that allowed him to theorise on the descent of species from a single source of life  No wonder those who cling to the literal truth of the bible so detest this theory  it kills off any serious possibility of creation or a creator  MLS While there were a few sections I admittedly rushed through  I often found myself amazed by the incredible insight and poetic majesty of Darwin s idea  I tried to imagine it being 1859 as I read it  a time when we know nothing of DNA  the fossil record was less robust than it is now and there was no Internet  This brought the power of his mind to full force  It s a book that must be read   This book helped me a lot to understand the criticism on Darwin s theory  most people just don t know what he was talking about  They skimmed through it until they found the chapter where Darwin admits that his theory might be totally wrong and   snap   there they had it  it must be complete bull It s a must read if one wants to participate in a discussion about  religion vs  science   Decided to read this book rather than accept what was being said about it and its ideas  Though a little hard to slog through the studies Darwin did  the facts and truths helped me in my re evaluation of beliefs  Ends up a very interesting read throwing a whole different perspective on life  I recommend this book to anyone who is willing to put away preconcieved notions and years of brainwashing  When I was presented the Bible at an early age I should have been presented this book  Along with those books  I should have been presented this book   Our bodies  Ourselves   Again facts and science win me over again  The religious people in my background spent too much time keeping me in the dark about too many simple scientific facts making life a lot more complex than it needed to be    Nature   God It is obvious that much in the book is outdated  though this book represents the first serious argument for Evolution  Moreover  Charles Darwin worked to overcome the burden of proof  showing how Evolution better describes nature than the leading theories of his time  Ironically  his arguments show that Creationism was a better thought out and more substantial theory than it is today  Although the modern theory of evolution is much changed from Darwin s initial proposition  with the introduction of genetics   the incorporation of many aspects of science into the theory  it still remains useful to read the origin of the origin of species  get it   It provides a useful insight about Darwin s way of thinking  keen eye    amazing observations  This book is about Charles Darwin and how he came about his theory of evolution  It is a first hand account on what Charles did and what he thought  This is a topic talked about in every biology class  I know that at the high school level  there is not much emphasis on Charles Darwin and what he did  which makes this a great read for students who want to learn more   If you have any interest in the theory of evolution or anthropology this is a must read  Its long and I zoned out a couple of times  but the information is fascinating and gave me a deeper understanding on how the theory has grown and the methods used to validate his findings  Charles Darwin is a hero of mine and I look forward to reading his other work   I can t emphasize enough the importance of this book  It freed  some  people from decaying hands of religion and showed our true place in the hands of Mother Nature  If there is any honesty in any of the books humans have ever written  this is the most honest one  It s a shame that humanity have given birth to so many Popes  but to only one Darwin     Origin is actually relatively easy to read and provides an excellent introduction to evolution theory  It describes Darwin s comparisons of hundreds of plants and animals to demonstrate that species had the same sort of  family  relationships as individuals  Unfortunately the book is not illustrated except for a single illustration showing inheritance  An honour to read a work by a man on the forefront of discovery  This 1979 Illustrated Edition is not as ambitious as Quammen s 2008 Illustrated Edition of Darwin s  Origin of Species   but it remains a fine illustrated example of Darwin s masterpeice  and has a 35 page introduction by Richard E  Leakey  the famous paleoanthropologist son of Louis Leakey  Numerous photographs  maps  charts  and color artwork  One of the most important works of science  Charles Darwin s Origin of Species is a monumental work that still stands the test of time  Darwin s beautiful writing coupled with his pure genius label the Origin of Species as an instant classic  Read the first edition  latter editions seem to have been ajusted to appease the religiously sensitive   These facts   says Darwin in the second sentence of his most famous and controversial book   seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species  the mystery of mysteries  as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers   And the sentences that follow have been shedding light on our species  and all others  ever since   I must confess that until finishing this book  I kinda felt like one of these people who click  Accept  on Terms Agreements pages without actually reading the damn thing  or you know  a christian who talks a lot about the Bible without bothering to read it   I m glad to mark  The Origin of Species  as my first book read in 2014   Really wondrous  Darwin was so passionate about his theory  Did not expect to be so moved by this book  but I was  I m not a religious person but it was interesting to see that Darwin s explanation and conclusion about evolution don t even necessarily conflict with belief in God  Everybody should read this book at least once  It should be automatically noted that this is a book of theory  more like a composition of field notes as opposed to free written thought That said  I can now say that I didn t like it  Darwin was in tune with his surroundings  but he failed to look outward  So why did I give it five stars Darwin  Loves  Details  If you only ever read one science book  this should be it  The prose is lucid and the argument simple and compelling  Darwin delivers his ground breaking theory   and the evidence to support it   without either the hyperbole or assumption of ignorance so common in many scientific books aimed at a lay audience  even today  I loved reading this in the science tutorial at St  John s College  Darwin s treatise does not just develop one of the great theories of human and natural science  it is an elegantly written text that draws upon litarary allusion  scientific reasoning and rigorous logic to demonstrate his thesis  This is a brilliant text  James Costa conducts a Darwin Summer Course at Harvard using this highly annotated text of Darwin s first edition of  The Origin of Species   Costa provides an additional chapter at the end   Coda   The  Origin  Evolving   Costa also uses this text for the Darwin course he teaches at Western Carolina University  Many talk about it   many comment on it   few have read it Strong suggestion to do so  At least it helps one understand from whence the controversy arises  and dispels the myths circulating about the same Tough going  though    many pages    essentially one long argument  Sentences 6 to 8 lines long  The most influential book in all biology  None have come to rival the impact of such a work  While Darwin did not answer the question preposed by the title  his theory has given us the framework in which to address it  A required reading for all who want to understand biology   Just be sure to read the 1st edition   Besides being one of the most important books ever written  it s remarkably well written  Yes  plenty of stretches of endless examples of variations in pigeons and barnacles  but those are the details   the spine of the book  the argument  for descent with modification over time  is elegantly structured and argued   Loved this book   should have actually  read  it when I was younger  The points he had to make became a little redundant  but he did have to prove and argue his points over and over again in order to prove his theory  The world wasn t made in just seven days folks    He is one of my heroes  Great read  This is a  de facto  5 star rating because of the importance of the book  The reasoning Darwin used without any knowledge of genetics is incredible  Yet the book has a very poor prose  with long sentences often punctuated with several commas that make it very difficult to read even for the expert reader  A very important book about the evolution of all alive species it was my first brick from my wall of knowledge in highschool   but still even today this books contradicts itself and it doesn t answer the most simple question if we humans are descending from monkeys why and when did we became conscius    Wednesday 17th September 2014 arrived today  I purchased this book after reading  The Signature of All Things  by Elizabeth Gilbert and it is a book I am currently reading  well dipping in and out of So glad to have a copy of this probably mainly used for reference but love it all the same I was really surprise to find out how well this book was written It s a smooth and pleasurable reading For some reason I had expected it to be as dry Newtons s Principia Far from it  Darwin is so clear and lucid that it s no wonder he made the observations that lead to his discovery  Definitely among the top 10 most important books of the past millenium  Great work by Charles Darwin  Explained to us all a lot  Without his revelations  a lot of us would still be struggling to make sense of this world  Still we find it difficult  but this book is a major step towards sanity  A very hard book to review because it is one of the most signifcant books written in the past two centuries  but is as readable as a telephone book  Underlying all the detail and support of his conclusions is the sense of curiosity  adventure and personal conflict that this endeavor provided  Every human curious of the history of all life known to us would do well to read this  It s one of the most important intellectual achievements of our species On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life    The famous reaction of Thomas Huxley sums it up   How extremely stupid not to have thought of that  Not only is the theory brilliant and important  the examples he uses to back it up are fascinating and thorough  This book is an example of how science books should be written  A Discovery show about Darwins 5 year exploration made me want to read the Origin which is derived from the observations on the journey and years of studying the specimens he brought home  The material can be kinda tedious  but the insights that he got from it all is mind geboggeling   This is such a beautifully written book  Darwin puts forward his theories with elegance and clarity  Though his theories have been further developed and more evidence has been gathered in more recent years his original work is still captivating and revolutionary  A true pleasure to read  there s always at least one logical reason answer for any mystery obstacle  whether you can find it lies on whether you are willing to see beyond 2 pairs of human eyes  i dedicate this book to all of my friends who never cease to surprise me with affections  care and labor of love  Very readable  this book sets out in compelling prose the use of plain observation and logic to revolutionise our understanding of the world  Still exciting to read through Darwin s slow build of arguments as he sets the stage and then basically goes to town with his many  many proofs  This man us an absolute genius especially for the time he was in and considering how little they knew on genetics back then  If you don t like this book or the facts he presents then you didn t understand the book either because you are religious or illiterate or most likely both  Darwin s opening account of the formation of the idea which later fully embodied itself as the theory of evolution as he was sailing has long stuck with me since I read it at the behest of my biology teacher in the 9th grade  Still one of my tattered dog eared favorites to this day  FYI  these Barnes and Nobles Classics Trade Paper series  more 50 titles of them  are available at all Kinokuniya under Rp 90 000    that s a good bargain  plus you still get a 10 20  discount   I have my eyes set on Alexandre Dumas Three Musketeers  and The Man In The Iron Mask  I really enjoyed this  Although Charles certainly wrote some complex sentences  I didn t find it hard to follow  He includes so many good examples and analogies  I also enjoyed the summary chapter at the end  I listened to the audiobook with Richard Dawkins narrating  Loved it   I am taking a class on Genetics and Evolution and since this is Spring Break week  I thought I would use this time to read this book that was mentioned so often  Well worth the time  I am just amazed that so much was accomplished with so little on the side of technology   The book is a breathtaking work of science  Its beautiful  no nonsense  large structure is simple  example  example  example     synthesis  Repeat that formula as necessary to complete the book  I just LOVED this book and came away feeling so much smarter because I read it  Disclaimer to the 5 stars  I m biased I have been meaning to read this for awhile because it is obviously such a key text in evolutionary biology  I listened to the audiobook and probably would have benefited more from reading it than listening to it  but alas  True genius  I read this baby from cover to cover and came away impressed with two things  Darwin s brilliance and his humility  Dense reading  but indispensable for those who want a deeper understanding into the book that started the shift in scientific thinking  I was warned when I bought this book  I would not like it  They were wrong  As some may find it dry  I found it amazing how logical Darwin thought process was  Very interesting  but my opinion may be off  i also enjoyed reading the Warren Commission s Report  Back to the source  Darwin was a genius   Origin  was published 150 years ago and  though some aspects have been significantly reworked  the basic idea of natural selection has become THE backbone of modern biology  His writing is clear  forceful and very cogent   Whoever is led to believe that species are mutable will do good service by conscientiously expressing his conviction  for only thus can the load of prejudice by which this subject is overwhelmed be removed   And we still have a long way to go    Also too much to say to confine to a GoodReads review  Someday I ll write more about it   In the mean time  check this out Darwin  The Legacy I enjoyed this but at times it was hard going if you are not into the subject Some really interesting issues raised Not for the faint hearted and not really for the layman  you have to be interested in or have a background in science and biology  Finally read this book and now understand how Darwin s attention to detail and careful explanation made this a revolutionary book on our place in the natural world  He even forewarned the dangers of being too successful of a species as humans have become  Darwin revolutionized Natural Science with his book on the Theory of Natural Selection  His analysis of the abundant evidence is really impressive when you consider that he put this together during the 19th century  A must read for Science enthusiasts  Note  I read the 1st edition as contained in the 4 book compilation of Darwin s greatest works called From So Simple a Beginning  edited by E O  Wilson It IS  one long argument   and well done  even where evidence was sketchy or not yet available L Origine delle Specie di Charles Darwin e probabilmente il piu grande antidoto letterario della storia agli antropocentrismi di ogni epoca Origin of the Species by Charles Darwin is probably the greatest literary antidote to anthropocentrism in history  It is always better to read the source rather than go by what others say and write about it  I found this very enriching  This book put a lot of separate pieces of information together to understand evolution  adaptation and niches so much better   The foundation of my understanding of the world  built upon by great science up to this day  The audiobook read by Richard Dawkins was excellent           The manuscript summarizing one the the greatest accomplishments by any human who ever lived  Charles Darwins theories have and are still important in the scientific community  As one of the founding fathers for the theory of Evolution this book is a must read  He explains one of the mechanism of evolution Natural Selection and much more   Five stars for its importance to modern science  not necessarily because it is a book that will keep you up late at night reading  Highly recommended to both proponents and opponents of evolution to see what Darwin actually theorized and why  I like this book because Darwin can elloquently voice his opinions and beliefs in a way that everyone can understand  I do not neceassarily believe in his theory  but it is still interesting to learn abiout all of the different opinions out there  What s not to love  This guy basically founds modern biology and is simultaneously a critic of prevailing methods of inquiry  What you see is that he believes in the plausible  not just the directly observable  the hallmark of great science   David Quammen had edited a beautiful Illustrated Edition of Darwin s  On the Origin of Species   With photographs  drawings  maps  paintings  plus significant notes and annotations  this 2008 edition is the finest  Origin  I have read  What is there to say  The man who started it all  well  there was Lamark but      I find this book is really easy to read even for those without any scientific background  Clears many misconceptions about the theory of evolution   It is amazing to discover how timeless Darwin s writing was  While much has changed of our understanding of evolution after 150 more years of research  a reading of The Origin will remind you how prescient Darwin was in the 1850 s  When reading it  I am struck by how forward thinking Darwin is  He even argues here that global climate change could disrupt human societies   keep in mind this was written in 1859  While a difficult read  it is ultimately rewarding   The first impression is awkward  it looks like a dejavu  since I have read much of the argument line in other text  Nevertheless  this is the source  not the plagiarist All in all  it is a very pleasant and striking reading  I had always assumed that Origin of Species would be a difficult read given its age  written in 1859  and the technical nature of the subject  But really  the book is a quick and easy read  Loved it  Highly recommended   This book will make you smarter  Regardless of evolution s implications in biology  its implications for politics and economics make this book worth reading  even if Darwin never details his thoughts  Truly a glimpse of genius  i liked this book because i m interested in evolution and believe in it  it is not for everyone  i don t usually discuss that i ve read this book with others since it can be very controversial  it was a slow read though  Certainly a book anyone with an interest in science and the history of science should read  It presents a very well argued theory building on other theories of the time as to the reason the world is so biologically diverse  Interesting and well written  though sometimes repetitive  and I very much enjoyed the passages from The voyage of The Beagle  Good ideas Darwin was a genius  the see and describe the connectedness of all life before we understood genetics was just amazing  That evolution is still denied  in some religious circles  some 150 years later is unbelievable   The theory offers no surprises but what amazed me was the honesty about uncertainties in the theory and the astonishing weight of evidence that supports it  Well worth the time invested  Why do dogs have tails  Since its publication about 150 years ago it has created controversy  I consider it one of the most important books ever published  There is now a biography about the book by Janet Browne highlighting its magnitude   Possibly the single greatest scientific book of them all   containing the idea that small changes over millennia from the simplest beginnings can lead to all the complexity we see today   that just happened to be right  A clareza de analise e a visao de Darwin sao impressionantes  especialmente se tivermos em conta a epoca e os preconceitos que o rodeavam quando escreveu este livro ha mais de 150 anos  Simplesmente genial   Although somewhat dated by our current standards  it was wonderful to read Darwin s thoughts on evolution and how he and his fellow scientists interpreted their own observations over the years  Definitely a must  One of the best books I have read  This is less of a book  more of a long but very well written  and argued  paper  Wish I had read this earlier  Should read parts of the book again    some facts were quite surprising  This book is a pillar of  Modern  Western cosmology  science     this book is to science what Genesis is to past Western medieval culture  It is the currant and most influential origin story in  our  culture   After reading  The Voyage of the Beagle   I had to read this and see what Darwin made of his trip  The book is a tough read if you don t stick with it  but I enjoyed the most of it and found it really enlightening  What am I going to say about this  The book is a brilliant piece of work by a brilliant naturalist  Irrefutable and brilliant  If the bible was even half as well done Jesus might have a chance with me   I am currently re reading this and am astounded by the wealth of evidence Dawrwin amassed in what was amuch reduced book than the one he wanted to write to reveal his theory of Evolution by Natural Selection  What is amazing is that most of what he wrote then is still relevant in biology today and that this book can still teach to a modern public two or three things about evolution  Easy and amazing to read  Well worth the effort to read  A brilliant case of seeing what is there rather than what one expected and of building a case a reader can follow  Perhaps a more brilliant work of philosophy than of science  simply put  a vital and important book  one everyone ought to have on their own good books book shelf  Read Dawkins for up to date evolutionary biology   read Mr Darwin for the beginning of enlightenment  Try to read the earlier editions as he wrote them quickly under the duress of being trumped  Although  each successive edition has apologies and awkward revisions  it s still the most important book written  An astonishingly enjoyable read  Contrary to what one might expect from a 19th century scientist  Darwin s prose is lucid and flowing  And of course  it s one of the foundational works of modern biology  A gemstone of science    possibly one of the greatest of all subjects  This book is one of the biggest influences of my lifetime  as a knowledge seeker  and deserves a place of honor on my bookshelf  Though this audiobook is sometimes a difficult listen due to the Victorian penchant for long sentences  it s worth every minute of attention  Darwin s science and argumentation is pure beauty  Could I really rate the Origin of Species anything else  That would be like the pope giving the bible three stars and saying  It started strong  but lost me with the whole Moses bit    I had to read it for a class and I loved it  Yes  it was long and there were seemingly endless pages of random evidence  but I loved it  I ve kind of developed a crush on Charles Darwin  Make sure you do read the 1st edition  of which this is an example   The later editions got harder and harder to follow as Darwin added responses to various objections raised by critics  It is  without any doubt  a tough read  but a very exciting and very interesting one  After all  it IS a scientific classic and one of the most important scientific publications ever  Lei este libro hace muchos anos y me impresiono muchisimo  Despues me interese por otro libro de Darwin   La expresion de las emociones en el hombre y los animales   igual de ameno  For school  The annotations are excellent in regard to giving historical and scientific context as well as succinctly noting what verbiage  etc   Darwin changed in later additions   This is one of the best books I have ever read  Without a science background it was difficult at first  but when I finished it  it was well worth it  An all around good read  Very enlightening  It took a while mostly because of the nineteenth century language  I m not used to reading books that old   This is science at its best  I loved it  What can I say  I totally loved Origin of Species  Now if I could only convince my students that it is an easy read   If you re going to read this  get the first edition  When man sees a horizon that goes beyond the obvious view that evolution is the only explanation  and with it new questions  because the evolutionary process is continuous  An exceptional work among the best of the best in the scientific field  not only for its groundbreaking content  but also because it is a great example of writing excellence  second time reading  I love this book as it suplies me both with knowledge of the natural world and also it is my armor against the dangerous insanity of the religious hordes   If you establish a theory of this magnitude and are able to describe it in a coherent and chrystal clear way  well I suppose this is one of those books that is beyond competition  Good to read the book by the man himself  and to see what parts of his theory were wrong and the parts that ended up being confirmed by modern science  specifically genetics Well  I did it  I finished it cover to cover  I took many dozens of notes along the way  and I outlined a global summary based on the last chapter  It is an amazing work  Libro imprescindible en la escuela  Muy facil de leer y entender a pesar de todo el tiempo que ha pasado por el  Se entiende bien su trascendencia en la ciencia moderna  A must read for any human being  Yes  it can get dry  Yes  it can get boring  But it is one of the most important work ever written and should be read as such  Should be required reading  and not just a reference  when teaching evolution in school  Not difficult reading  Written for the ordinary person  not for scientists   This is my second read  read it in my first year of graduate school in Anthropology   Darwin s seminal work is amazingly well written for a scientific treatise  Probably read 2 3 of it  but stunningly readable given the time it was written  Impossible to appreciate today how world shattering this was when it was published  One of the most original and brilliant works of all time  Inspired generations of scientists who after two hundred years still mount new evidences of its correctness  I read the version that had a forward by Richard Leakey which was wonderful  It was nice to finally read the original text after having it used as a reference so often  Oh  this is a great book  And  there is this textbook but it is an engaging read     it is Evolutionary Biology by Futuyma  Together  good reading  Great subject  Concentrated brilliance  I challenge any creationist or believer in intelligent design to read Darwin firsthand and  more importantly  think for themselves  Lot of people misunderstood of Darwin s idea If you want to read his idea of the origin of mankind  not the  monkey  version   you should read this book  Really interesting read but a little dry sometimes  It is refreshing to visit past ideas with new information and see how far our understanding has come  i ve been  currently reading  this book for years now   a really great book to pick up  read a paragraph or two and mull over it for a day  darwin rules  Great book  often misunderstood  Take home is ideas of speciation and what a species really is  Great book available as free audiobook from Librevox org What more can one say but to echo Dobzhansky s  Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution  An invaluable classic with utterly important implications for everyone in defining his her position on many issues  philosophical as well as scientific  Even though I wish Darwin was less afraid of using periods  there s no way to give this book anything other than 5 5  I mean    it s THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES  I read this books as part of the University of King s College  Halifax  Nova Scotia  Canada  Foundation Year Program  FYP  and absolutely loved it  Amazing book and fascinating  but hard to read  I wish someone would update it and  translate  it to standard English rather than science ese   Of all the books I have ever read  this is the most daring and influential Surprisingly accessible with many clear examples  A fantastic book  Darwin s voice is all his own and so were his ideas  This was quite an achievement at the time and it is still important today  One of the few Christians of Time s Chronology Era that got life worth acknowledging  it evolves and goes on  One of my favorites   Most excellent from the first word to the last  Of the classics of natural science which I have read  this is among my very favorites  An interesting and surprisingly readable book if you are curious about the birth of one of the greatest scientific theory in 19th century  beautiful to read  charles d is right there with me  and i always think of his daughter and of his travels  i just love reading darwin  The sheer peaks of human thought on display is breathtaking  The observation and inference is a beautiful experience  to say the least   An American monkey  after getting drunk on brandy  would never touch it again  and thus is much wiser than most men      Charles Darwin As controversial as this book is I found it to give me a new perspective on life  Darwin s theories help me beter understand our race  The 5 star rating for this has not so much to do with the writing ability of Darwin  but on the importance and ramifications of the work   I have read a lot of books on evolution  But this is the first time I ever read  On the origin of species   And I am glad I did  Puts the entire world into perspective  History  morality  science  none of it can be truly understood without Darwin s theory  Does this really need a review  I mean  it s the beginning of how we think about species  evolution  variation  and speciation  Reading Victorian scientific literature tends to be a bit arduous  but Darwin s presentation makes it much easier to digest  I reference this still quite a bit  Luckily I have 2 versions  one on my kindle and one in a hard cover my boyfriend got me   I got this one from my father  One of those books that actually makes sense  A must read for every human being  Important  well structured monologue  I skipped two chapters in the middle  sorry charles   but it was a bit tedious   I find this very important piece of literary and scientific genius a fascinating read  I give it five stars   Excellent  and surprisingly soft spoken  perhaps not so surprisingly  I guess he knew the controversy it would bring    Love it  it s science it s figuring out what it s all about and how we got here  Right or wrong it s good to read  Well right now i am reading this book  and it is cool right now  I heard about this in science  and loved the idea  We learnt most of these things in this book in Science class  but this is in more detail and easy to understand  I ve been meaning to read Darwin for a really long time so I have just bought  I m determined to understand evolution  If I didn t give this book a 5 star rating  I think my college would take back my degree in Biology   How can you rate books like this that changed the whole course of history  Of course it has to be a five   D  Amazingly readable  Loved his writing  his breadth of knowledge  his generosity  his modesty  Borrowed from Rockwall County Library Really interesting additional material about Darwin s life and ideas  What can I say  One of the most gentle  and carefully reasoned analysis of the natural world ever written   Can I give it six stars  Amazing insights on every page  it is incredible reading the mind of a genius  Compelling in its argument  profound in its significance  and much more readable than most science books  I ve been meaning to sit down and read this for a while  It is cheating to give it 5 stars before I do  One of the most important books you ll ever read  Understand it  Enjoy it  Do not fear it  You can t consider yourself a fullhuman being without understanding the significance of Darwin   easier to read than i expected  if you enjoy nature i think you can appreciate this book  I love this book  I wish I could have met this man  He was a true naturalist and I admire him   Now  this book changed everything  it freed us from superstition  and gave us real knowledge The quintessential work of evolutionary theory  by its wisest and most humble expostulator   One of my favorite books of all time  I love clarity of the arguments and the explanations  Do you think this book is blocked if you re attempting to rate it from a Kansas IP address  For one of the classics it was actually quite understandable and readable and kept my attention  Amazing  Full of information and ideas  I loved it  I will have to read it again  My favourite bit is when he s talking about all the different kinds of ants  What a guy  For me   the best non fiction book of all time  A work of genius and dedication   Nothing to say really    the most radical idea a single human being has ever had   EVERYONE should read this book  Not only great science  but a great read as well  Brilliant  Earth shaking  Genius  One of THE MOST important books ever published  One of the most important books ever written  I wish I d read it 30 years sooner  Not an easy read  but well worth it  What biological anthropologist hasn t read it  If you havent Read this yet    Do it NOW  A little boring but it will blow your mind  including one of my favorite quotes   pigeons do not perch  or willingly roost  on trees  I love this book  I can t say anything that hasn t already been said  Just read it  another one that is

finishing  The seminal book on evolution by Charles Darwin  I use is as a reference often  I read this for a class several years ago and really found it interesting  There is no book that is so important as this one  Brave writer and sharp mind  I have a really old hard copy of this book  I think the book is a must read   Rated for its importance more than its readability   it is not an easy read   Darwin s work is genius  No other words can explain him or this book   On of the founding fathers of modern biology   may he never  EVER be banned  Ok  glad I read this masterpiece  even if I had to skip a lot of beetles  Read the first edition  Not the 6th  It makes for a much clearer read   A work of literature as much as of science  Darwin is never out of time   a book little read  that

in evolution as I did before reading this timeless masterpiece  but to be lead into Darwins brain and explore how he came up with and basically proved evolution is mindblowing  Take your time with this one  Wikipedia is your friend and if you dont already have a grasp on the geologic time scale  get one  Same goes for the species presented in the book  After going of on some many tangents I feel like I have both a minor in Geology and Zoology  This is actually a very readable book for what really amounts to a giant science article  a 19th century one at that  While time consuming I feel I have been rewarding with a feeling of understanding that presents itself in everyday life  This is one of the most satisfying books I have ever read  Enlightening  The man  What more can I say  It s
