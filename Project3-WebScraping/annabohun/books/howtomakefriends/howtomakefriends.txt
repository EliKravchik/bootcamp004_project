4 5 stars  Excellent read  Very much a product of its time and yet shockingly contemporary  Made me feel like the 1930s were closer to today s way of thinking than the post war era  He was extremely open minded on many topics  from religion to work  Enjoyable hearing old time stories of FDR  Lincoln  Franklin and many more  Great ideas for getting along in the world with more joy and less trouble  My main criticisms are  1  his treatment of gender and 2  his theory of change  On gender  the book is full of stories of sexual harassment in the workplace and mansplaining  That s agitating  Second  I don t think Dale Carnegie has any conception of the struggle to change society  particularly as a white privileged man  Society just worked for him  For blacks and other minorities  for women  for gay people  the world is full of bias and prejudice  How best to handle this  Often  I think Carnegie s approach is correct  You can catch more flies with honey  But other times  I think we should consider our theories of how change happens  and recognize that struggle  criticism and resistance are necessary  In short  very thought provoking and fun read  Especially the old timey audiobook reader  Highly recommended  I m surprised to say that  But it s a fun book  full of wisdom  And it s less about manipulation than kindness  understanding  listening and taking others  perspective into account   It s a good book that include useful tips for influence people  Also has lots of influential and memorable quotes in it and easy to read  My grandfather  the most affable person I ve ever met  swore by Dale Carnegie s books  This is the first that I have read and I find it to be quite helpful  Sometimes I refer to parts of it to remind myself to apply them in my daily life  The title may sounds pretentious  or like something only a salesperson or politician would read  but it s really helpful just for how a person interacts with other people  I have had problems with social anxiety  and I find that thinking about some of Carnegie s methods helps me handle social situations by concentrating on being genuinely interested in what people have to say rather than how awkward I feel Bottom Line  How to Win Friends and Influence People can help pretty much anyone interact with his or her peers more effectively  I have this audio book and yes  you CAN have the jobs you want  I read this after a friend said he had read it and said what was written was fairly self explanatory  Yes  it is self explanatory for some people  and yes  some of the book seems to be outdated  but overall  the principles conveyed and backed up with examples are good tenets for anyone to have a refresher on  be kind  and others will be kind to you  We all have our struggles  Let s remember that  One of the early  How to s  Good bookmn  qdm w lTf ktb lms d  ldhty   Went through this book again  audio book   Honestly  didnt like it as much as i liked when i first read it  But it reinforced one fact  the basics of dealing with humans wont drastically change  no matter how much technology invades our lives  No earth shattering new insights  but a good collection of tips  Everybody will definitely learn at least one thing from this book  The fast smooth narrative and unique anecdotes explain why this book has stood the test of time  Dale Carnegie provides a practical guide to speak and to influence people by developing your speaking skills  Who does not want to develop  Who does not want to be influential  Neither do I  This is not only a personal development book  but will help you as well when you want to improve your abilities as a business person  I did like this book very well  and it will help me very well to develop myself in business life and personal life  I am glad that revisions were made to fit the current world  and I will probably read this book again in the upcoming few months  I finally read it  Probably one of the most influential business books  I can see why it lives on  It s packed with actual tips for how to be liked and listened to  and who doesn t want that  It s nice that each tip is brought to life with a few cases  but there s a whole lot of movie magic happening in these scenarios  the antagonist always says and reacts in exactly the right way to create an outcome  The value nevertheless is provided in the reveal of these techniques  The bonus comes that they re productive to society on the whole  The catch is that the way that they re applied is the only thing that matters  and genuinely  tactfully  effectively employing them is much easier said than done  Important read  though   Amazing book and provides insight on how to look from others perspective This will stand as one of the best book for me and will refer it in between  In some ways  the material in this book is dated  however  the underlying message is timeless  It s the golden rule  treat others as you would want to be treated You may want to be less verbose in how you execute the principles presented  but the advice is still sound  It s a better book than most self help books  This book is relatively bullshit free and suggests techniques that are less manipulative than other self help books  I wouldn t call it well researched and while there are historical and personal examples it does not reference proper studies  The book sets outs the points that it makes in a useful manner  The book is rather readable and relevant dispite having been written in 1936 and since it is a classic you will at least be getting some cultural knowledge out of reading it  A must read  Highly Recommended Become a master of tact and diplomacy The purpose of education is not to know but to do  said a scholar  Now if you read this and do  you will win friends and influence people  I enjoyed this book thoroughly  and let me put it this way  I spend the past decade educating myself  completing a masters degree  working hard  reading  engaging in heavy discussions  When I started school and work  I remember thinking with my intellect  I want to bring about a change in the world  NOTHING WORKED   I could have all the knowledge and the drive in this world to want to make a difference but without the fundamental knowledge on how to work with people  how to influence others and work effectively through arguments  I realized I will not succeed  This book and the contents therein  challenged my goals and my rationale  I plan to refocus my energy on capping and harnessing the energy of most invaluable asset of all  people  A book I would highly recommend   It s funny how this book was published in 1936  but human nature hasn t changed  This book was well written and well organized  although I think I would have gotten more out of it was more modern  with more recent examples of people who were great with people  other than Lincoln and Rockefeller   But  it was written when it was written  Good  common sense    Nice read  I never thought a book wrote in 1930 s will be of relevance now  But Dale Carnegie proved it The only problem I found was  book has a lot of examples for each topic and most of the examples revolve around American history and american business men  A good business book  It s lessons are relevant even today  If you re a new manager learning the ropes this book should help   This is an easy book to discount  There is the slogan that the title has become  Many of the examples seem outdated at first  from the early 20th century  and the narrative sounds naive in today s highly skeptical social atmosphere  In addition  the lessons seem somewhat simple  I bought this book on a whim while I was browsing through a bookstore in the Hasidic neighborhood while vacationing in Brooklyn  curious about what the locals would be reading  So more just to see what happened than not  I decided to start trying to apply some of the advice Carnegie was offering up  I was amazed to see that these bits of advice actually did work  I realized that much of this I actually already knew but didn t want to apply because I thought those ideas were beneath me  So long after he wrote the book despite its outmoded style and examples  it s a great read and a great guide to dealing well with people  I m glad I succumbed to the whim and now I ll use these lessons for all my life   Classic   I keep retreading it kutb lkl mdb   Only con is the repetitiveness   This book was really highly reviewed and has been in print for like 80 years  However I feel that some of its age is beginning to show  There are times when I m not sure if the author is trying to get a point across or trying to sell some sort of cure all from 100 years ago  Listen to what my friend John Smith from Springfield  MO said about my course   and like phrases that are often said  His points are well illustrated and provides good examples though  It s a decent book  but shows its age  Worth a read if you want to actually win friends and influence people  I was hesitant at first  but I m glad I read it  I think this book is brilliant  Sometimes you actually forget that this book was published in the 30s because many  if not all  of the points apply to the current day  especially in the work place  I ve read a review that says the book teaches you how to be manipulative  but I don t think it does  A lot of the points reminds us that wherever you are  you are dealing with people  and politeness goes a long long way  When you ve been working a long time  you see people being impolite  and rude  in the name of familiarity  It may not be the boo for everyone  but as a reader  I think it is a good read   Vraiment un grand livre de M  Carnegie je l ai entendu pendant un voyage de 3 heures  Ce livre peut changer entierement ta vie un petit resume     Pour se faire des amis  influencer les autres et les gagner a notre cause  il est important de savoir menager leur ego   ceci passe par un changement important dans notre comportement de tous les jours  qui consiste a ne plus critiquer  a s interesser reellement aux autres  a sourire  a retenir le prenom de notre interlocuteur  a leur faire sentir leur importance  a ne jamais leur dire qu ils ont tort  a parler de nos erreurs avant de parler des leurs  a motiver  a complimenter sincerement  et de maniere generale  a toujours menager leur amour propre     A Classic   I should probably read this again   it s been a while     This is a book I ve been slowly processing for the better part of a year now  The ideas it contains are simple  and it all basically boils down to  be nice  see things other people s way  and then exploit what they want  At times I felt like the techniques were almost a little dirty  given that Carnegie is essentially asking everyone to exploit the human psyche  For example  rather than address a problem directly  you are supposed to butter up the other person  make them feel important  bow to their every need  and then they ll do what you want  I guess you can t argue with the results  but some of the things in the book just felt icky That said  the book contains good advice on what makes people tick and gives good ideas on how to make people like you  It s a good read that will add one more feather in your cap to help you navigate your job  your friends  and your family relationships  Still good advice decades after it was written  It would be interesting to see the family tree of self help books  I d bet that this little book  a quick read  is near the root  Each chapter has interesting stories and lessons from history about how men and women have been successful in life and business   A lot of the stories are from Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt  who are 2 of my favorite men of history   In each chapter  Carnegie drives home a simple point that would be useful in day to day interactions  Some of the points are as simple as being genuinely happy about seeing people and seeking to avoid arguments at all costs  That being said  none of the author s points are mind blowing in themselves  however  I found it quite useful to see how I can improve in my relations with others  I would certainly recommend this book to any of my friends  You have nothing to lose and a whole lot to gain by reading this book  It s a good book maybe it s helpful for my future I enjoy this book very much even if I m not good at English This book has a lot of examples so sometimes I can t completely understand them I think I should read it again after several months  A lot of good insights here  I feel like we do a lot of these things in the modern work place anyhow  but these techniques probably originated from this book  I love it  I ll read it more and more Wow  so I bought this book used and it is a version from 1964  I found it incredibly interesting to read in that all of the examples are very outdated and honestly  the book needs feminism  But that being said  After 1981  two sections were removed  on writing business letters and rules for making your home life happier  the latter being almost horrifying to read  being a young female growing up in the 21st century   Also  updated examples were published after 1981  I m getting this from Wikipedia  soo Fundamentally  most of the advice and general points in the book are great  and I may reread the newer version in the future  Reading this version was like looking in a time machine   Su thanh cong la do 15  nang luc  con 85  con lai la nho nhung moi quan he   Cuon sach nay da hoan toan chung

 An insightful book with very useful tips and short case studies which apply the tips  However  I felt that the tips given throughout were largely similar and simply reworded   most of them essentially boil down to understanding and empathising with people  This book has consistently been on best business books to read list  It s a good read  Some tactics seem a little sale ish   get the other person to say  yes    talk in terms of the other persons interest    while some are timeless   dramatize your ideas  and  let the other person save face    Easy read  Fantastic that this book published in 1938 still has legs  Amazing how this book has withstood the test of time  On occasion  reading anecdote after anecdote got to be a bit much  but I found myself really relating to some of the examples  too   Gives Incredible Insight  Must Read  A well written book  Enjoyed reading it    When I first read it  I determined to read it once a year  I have since read it twice       not quite once a year  It is a very influencial book  I should read it again soon  Great advice and somewhat ahead of its time in regards to self help books  A lot of the suggestions and ideas are common sense  We would all do well to internalize this  Interesting read  definitely makes you re evaluate your day to day conversations  I enjoyed it  Working my way through my favorite booklist http

as the first time I read it  Following Carnegies advice  I probably should refer to it more often  I ll keep this copy at hand  Hopefully  that ll help me find the courage to live this way  I think that this book is the accumulation of Dale Carnegie s lectures  The way that it is written is him making a claim and applying stories and multiple situations to support it The priority in effective communication is outstanding  rather then a simple  Do This  it is more a pause and think book  Trying to apply the situations to one s own life  Working on communication and human sciences  Dale calls upon his experience to help those who want to improve personal and business interactions I think that rather then reading it monthly as suggested  Ill read it again to start 2017 Podszedlem

name it how to be a great listener  Pfft  Transformed the way I see  listen   the noisy voices all around the world that cryimg for attentions  Welp  from listening comes the understanding of others  and that is the source of all kind of love  Eh  mqT y z zndgym r mdywn yn khtb hstm     mr b admh dwbrh ashty dd Such easy steps to follow in order to maintain healthy social  personal and professional success    Steps that are already integrated in our common sense and human nature  but we tend to forget them as we proceed on life and its complications  This book is a pause for people to rediscover those inner human nature and apply their findings to make their and others people life better an happier hence full of success   Simple but efficient technics to avoid argument in relations  I bought this book after my fren introduce me of Dale Carnegie listen more than you speak It is fun to read  with a lot of examples  However I cannot see how to apply that to real life if I m not a sale man Did I just misunderstand the book  A well written book  Enjoyed reading it    awaa A well written book  Enjoyed reading it    Interesting book  Carnegie ties psychology with his own experience and the experience of members of his classes  This book is very repetitive  which whilst is a little tedious  means that the ideas introduced start to sink in  Every idea proposed is elegantly linked with plenty of examples showing the reader how to use the  principles  in practice  Overall a good book that will give the reader something to think about when faced with new social interactions  It is emblematic of a man  dale Carnegie  and America at that time  This is such a hopeful little book  At some point in your life  someone who is trying to seem nice while actually acting superior will hand you this book  They will tell you that you absolutely have to read it and it will change your life  So you will  What you will find is a really nice  optimistic take on the world from a guy who just generally had a good attitude  You will not see the underlying white and male privilege  but it is there  None of the things that happened to the author would have happened if he was  say  a black female  And yet  it is uplifting and really a good read if you ignore the obvious flaws   A book that contrary to its title  encourages people to be less manipulative  more genuine and positive in nature  Carnegie relates his golden nuggets of wisdom through telling real world stories of people in everyday situations  I feel that his 12 principles say it all 1  The only way to win an argument is to avoid one2  Show respect for the other persons opinion  never say  you are wrong 3  If you are wrong admit it quickly and emphatically4  Begin in a friendly way5  Get the other person saying  yes yes  immediately6  Get the other person to do a great deal of talking7  Let the other person feel that the idea is their own8  Try honestly to see from the other persons point of view9  Be sympathetic with the other persons ideas and desires10  Appeal to the nobler motives11  Dramatize your ideas12  Throw down a challenge On being a leader 1 Begin with praise and honest appreciation2  Call attention to people s mistakes indirectly3  Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing others4  Ask questions instead of giving direct orders5  Let the other person save face6  Be lavish in your praise7  Give the person a fine reputation to live up to8  Make the fault seem easy to correct9  Make the person happy about doing the thing you suggest I appreciate universal truths and this book is full of them  I didn t love the  used car salesman  feel of this book  but I found the principles spot on  I underlined throughout while reading it and I will review this book regularly as I live my life  How precious the pearls of wisdom are that Carnegie shares here  If you have regular contact with human beings  you should read this   This was my favorite book when I was younger    Lots of needed tips for this girl   It reminds me how to better implement true principle  namely appreciating and loving people for who they are and showing that they are important through your actions  Upon the revisit this time around  I still liked it well enough and learned new things that correlated with this stage of my life  I must warn  however  that I got equally bored towards the end  and ended up tuning most of it out  Which is a shame  I will have to revisit the end again after a break   A well written book  Enjoyed reading it    Neat book  I liked it  http   www seoseocu com bu kitabi okumanizi tavsiye ederim  www tasarimistan com www bircekim com www birdavetiye com www birceviri com thank youseo web tasarim davetiyehavadan cekimbal I liked the book overall  it does not jive with my theology  However as long as I am genuine in approbation  praise and so forth I think this is a good way to work in people relations  I am giving it all a try  A Really good book  with advice when dealing with difficult people  I read this book to help me at my job  and some of the suggestions have really helped  It was easy to read  enjoyable with the real life experiences and suggestions in how to reduce those difficult situations that you encounter  worth trying   Very good  Gives you golden rules on how to communicate with people  I recommend it  A really great book for anyone who is wanting to learn to better interact with people  especially those who finds themselves in positions of authority or influence  This truly is a  must read  for all people  as it helps bring a more concise understanding of the way we respond to each other  and the whys associated with those responses   An informative book on a set of of social skills most parrallel to a politician s   Great ideas This book should be used in schools as a guide  Many young adults would be at a huge advantage if they practiced these rules at the beginning of their careers and in their

criticize  condemn and complain  and most do   I wish I could commit this whole book to memory  This was required reading for a business class I m taking and I was dragging my feet  not wanting to struggle through another dry and boring book  This is anything but dry and boring Honestly  I could have used this book at the beginning of the semester  Working in a team of 5 to complete a semester long project has been rough  Some people don t care about doing half assed work and will gladly accept a C while others just didn t bother to show up to team meeting  I could have used Dale Carnegie s wisdom during this process  Maybe I wouldn t have gotten stung while trying to extract honey  It is an old book  a lot has changed since 1936   and one can see that even though they tried to update the books examples  Only reason why I m not giving 5 stars It is at the same time a timeless book with principles that held for my grandfather and will still hold for me Highly recommend reading it as we are all social animals  Just finished reading  How to Win Friends and Influence People   2006  by Dale Carnegie  Perhaps the most well known self help book of all time  I decided to borrow it and understand Carnegie s most popular book that serves as influence for many other modern self help books If the book s contents seem familiar  it s because the book was originally written back in 1936  Carnegie s book details the basic skills of communication that are common sense in terms of dealing with people  yet are underutilised by many people  His words of wisdom are simplistic  and he preaches values of empathy  humility  patience and understanding so that readers can become better people The lessons in the book are backed up purely by anecdotes that the author has personally heard from the people he has come across during his lifetime  More story based than scientific  his writing style reflects the kind of person Carnegie is  a hardworking boy from Missouri who experienced many failures and setbacks in his career  but had a knack for public speaking and soon got his huge break and became the most influential self help coach of all time Though the contents and writing style are understandably dated  his lessons are anything but obsolete  They serve as timeless morals that everyone can benefit and learn to apply in daily life  I thank the man who perhaps would not understand the sheer importance of his own book even to this day NEXT BOOK   The Art of Work   2015  by Jeff Goins  A well written book  Enjoyed reading it    reading a second or third time  timeless  Should keep to review every now and then  An old book  but very valuable I formation for everyone   Ok  so it s been a while since I finished this one    This is a massive book that covers a LOT of ground  A definite must for anyone who wants to impact other people and figure out how to win people over and keep them  the opposite of manipulation     o    Although this book is a little dated  The principles and ideas are sound  I believe this book has helped me to become a better listener  Buku ini dah lma bgt pnya  klo ga salah sktar kelas 1 ato 2 smp gtu  tp terakhr dipjm temen n blm blik smpe skrg    mana orgnya ga tau kemana  ya sdhlah  Well  bukunya bgus  dari penyajian kata2nya jg ga terlalu kaku   that s all  Referred to in a Social Psychology MOOC  so I read it despite scepticism and found it surprisingly useful  Probably worth reading a few more times  How to Win Friends and Influence People   Dale CarnegieIf there is only one thing that you will remember from  How to win friends and influence people   make sure it will be Abraham Lincoln s famous quote   a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall  Keep this in mind the next time you start a conversation with your life partner  colleague or boss    more practical and brilliant   A great book with practical examples which makes it very interesting   Somewhat of a chore to read at times  but overall a great book with excellent and valid principles that can certainly be applied  A book like this would best be something of study material or morning inspiration  A timeless book  Read it for the first time when I was 15 after my father recommended it  The examples are great and the advices are relevant to this date  This is definitely a must read  Even if you don t feel like you actually need this type of advice  It will give insight into people s behaviour and it will also help see if you re doing something that is setting you back  because you might be doing it without intending to  A lot of things might seem obvious  but it is the type of stuff one usually overlooks in everyday life  And it won t hurt to keep these rules in mind  The techniques in this book honestly work  there are plenty of stories that show examples of when and how the techniques presented in this book work  there are also a plethora of inspirational quotes  good for anyone  from a college student  to a busy mother  this book really gets you to understand people better and helps you interact in ways that will be to your advantage  I finally read this book cover to cover  even though it has been sitting on our shelves for years   I have skimmed through it a few times  It was worth the read  In fact  I ve decided I need to read it about once a year The title sounds like it s a book on how to manipulate people  and since it was originally published in 1937  it is terribly dated in an interesting sort of way  However  the principles are fantastic   basically the Golden Rule broken down into subcategories with dozens of real life examples that made me sit back  think about how I interact with people  and decide to consciously make some changes In fact  since reading it  I ve made an effort to change my reactions interactions with my kids and all the people I have had to interact with as a result of moving  moving truck drivers  cable installer  lots of customer service reps  etc    It s been refreshing and enlightening  Not that I was a beast before  but we can all get in the habit of sometimes letting our frustrations get in the way of treating people with the respect and consideration we all deserve  You ll see what I mean when you read the book  Despite what some reviewers might have you think  this book is not about flattering people with fake platitudes so you can puff up their self esteem and take advantage of them for personal gain  I ve seen a few reviews that state this and it s obvious that they either didn t read the entire book or they only skimmed it  Dale points out multiple times in multiple chapters that the intent of his book isn t to have people flattering others with false praise  If you missed that  it is your fault  not his  As for my review  This is a relatively useful book  Some of the information was common sense to me  don t interrupt people while they re talking   but some of the tidbits were very useful for navigating the workplace as well as  civilian  life  Simple things like making others feel important for their contributions are easily forgotten nowadays  it seems  This book  albeit with the information properly condensed and the examples made age appropriate  would be fantastic for children in younger grades because it teaches you how to listen to others  to respect what they re saying and to expect the same in return  In a perfect world  you would expect parents to teach these types of life skills  but that isn t always the case  I m sure I ll re read this book a few times  though I highlighted particularly useful information   but I m still docking a star because  at least for me  some of the chapters fell flat due to it being common sense to me  But that s just my personal opinion  obviously  You may get more or less use out of it  I suggest you check it out for yourself  though  I bought   read this book when I was in China  as it was one of a couple  classics  that were readily available in English  I picked this book up because I loved the movie  How to Lose Friends and Influence People  and thought this book was based on that     Kindly excuse ma ignance  Since I had no clue what this book was about  I didn t know what type of book it was  At first I thought maybe it was a farce  that this was a parody or something  because    I don t know  it seemed so cliche  But then I got really into it and started thinking Dale Carnegie was a genius  I could use these methods in my life  I even started trying to memorize rules in my head to use for the future  On top of that  I remember thinking it was an amusing read  and I liked hearing all the little stories I need to reread it  I forget all the tips  They were basically  Be a genuinely nice person to others   right  haha  March 2009  I enjoyed this book a lot  I have tried to implement some of the principles in my life and work April 2012   currently reading again  Most likely my favorite self help of all time    if only I could remember it  Nice book to read A good motivational content for improving your relations in your day to day life  pesannya repetitiftapi mungkin itu maksud buku ini kali yalanjutin laen kali aja deh This book is probably in the top ten list of self help books I ve read so far  no wonder why it s still alive although I was first published in 1937  There are a few reasons why it can be able to catch my interests  1  It stated clearly in each point  2  It contains many practical examples of famous people during his time 3  It summarizes what it has described into an easy glance It is highly recommended to whomever wants to know about self belief  self confidence and simple steps to make friends  This was an interesting read  I believe a more accurate title would be  How to manipulate people to get what you want while looking like a good person   There are some good advice about how to mitigate arguments  work together and advance  however this is one of those books that can give perceived power to the wrong people  Manipulation can and is a very serious issue and this book gives you the keys on how to manipulate situations to your favor  That isn t a real honest position and can ultimately hurt those you love the most   very VERY useful tips and tricks here Interesting read  fives a lot of example of strategies companies have to influence behaviour  Great help for sals people and anyone working in marketing  Very iteresting psychological insight in human behaviour and consuming patterns  I enjoyed reading it and it gave me a lot of ideas  A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men    I read this once a year  You should too   Highly  unintentionally  entertaining  I don t think there are many people out there who could use the lessons of this book more than me  I ll probably have to re read this one from time to time New friend count after reading this book  0  will have to keep a tally  i think this book actually open my mind about how to appreciate somebody how to know the others people habit  now i have open my mind and i just want to prove it    The stories are from way back in the day and feel bit outdated but the lessons are timeless  Just read it  Give u the basic of good human relations  Changing ur paradigm to social oriented approach  All of the points are very practical  What s left is up to us to practice them regularly  Combine with body language skills  Interesting book  although the book is old it is still relevant  I recommend you read this book for your own personal development Although this book is a classic it does not discuss the art of keeping friends nor does it cover levels of friendship  I wish there was a book that talked more about what it takes to maintain friendships and how to grow friendships to a deeper level  When I heard the title of the book  made up my mind that I would never read it  Met a person while travelling from Pune to Mumbai  who suggested that I should read it  Gave it a shot  and instantly fell in love with it  A must read for anyone who wants to improve his relations  understand the way human beings behave  and develop good people management skills  An excellent book filled with useful information and examples  It was a very interesting book  Pretty much common sense  but if it were so common  there wouldn t be a book about it   I ran into some cases of me going   But what if      that weren t addressed  but I figured in real emergencies  you wouldn t follow this book s advice Anyway  will be trying to follow some of these in the future and see how it works out for me  horrible title but really great book  hard to believe it was written in the 30s    Excellent should be required reading for every professional    How to Win Friends and Influence People  was the first book recommended to read as part of my Animation degree as so much of our work is done in teams and therefore requires good people relations and the ability to share sell ideas  For this purpose  I felt that Carnegie did a good job and left me with a lot to ponder on  Carnegie uses lots of anecdotes to help explain and memorize the teachings and the summaries at the end of each section also make the book easier to recap  I d say the core message in this book is  at the risk of over simplification   treat people kindly and respectfully and they re more likely to listen to what you have to say without adversity  Be humble and patient   First published in 1937  this still is a classic that surpasses the thousands of other books that have afterwards been published about maintaining successful relations with other people Although you can feel the  American Dream  lingering in the background  and even if the fascination of Carnegie for presidents and industrial tycoons feels like an odd choice to a present day reading public  that doesn t take away that the simple principles Carnegie expands are still valid today Want some basic ones 1  Refrain from complaints or criticism  judge no one2  Show your appreciation  be honest and straightforward3  Instill people with a desire to do or want somethingAs for conversations  the book boils down to  don t be self centered  stop babbling about yourself and show genuine interest in other people Carnegie explains all his ideas in a engaging manner and illustrates them with loads of examples or anecdotes The funniest thing to do with this book is  trying it out If you apply only a few of the ideas on the people around you  either familiar or new acquaintances  the result is astonishing  Friends visit you more often  total strangers poor their heart out  without being drunk and in a bar  and everybody seems to think you re the nicest person on earth Thank you for reading this  I really appreciate the time you gave my review      I m not a fan of the title of this book   But  I find that there are many topics within these pages that focus our thoughts  actions  and words on being an encouraging friend and person of influence to the people you are around    Being encouraging requires a special attitude  When you look at another person  rather than seeing her faults  you need to be able to see her strengths and possibilities  what she is capable of    Many of us don t take the time to consider what actually motivates people   p 211 I found this book written to the business audience but I believe teachers  parents  and anyone looking to be a supporting friend can find examples of great moments leaders led others to believe in themselves  something we all should strive to impart in others     Very good book on maintaining good relationships  I m reading it constantly and it really helps me to gain confidence in communicating and always helps me in depressing situations of life     Takes the golden rule and endeavors to provide a book of case studies that support it  Whether we are religious or just an average layman  the human flesh has its biases  We crave attention  we want to feel validated  and if you are ever wise enough to acknowledge the human bias within yourself then you will be perceptive enough to possibly exploit that in others  And    This book beat the alternative  Imagine having Mr  Burns as a boss   Very helpful and well written book  A must read  I learned a ton from this book  and it s already made a difference in the way I do things  Especially potty training  I loved this book   This is a great uplifting and optomistic book  This book was for one of my college assignments  I quite enjoyed it   This should be a MUST read for EVERYONE  chapter one should be taught in school This book has been criticized for being a  sycophants in training  manual  I happen to agree  but the author tosses in a disclaimer that admonishes readers that his  cracker barrel idioms   principles  are not maxims  In fact  the book encourages a trial and error method with his advice and to discard it  if need be  I decided to read this book with a mindset of trying to find some information on how to improve my social interactions with people or to realize when another person is using a manipulative tactic on me  I find this book validated many aspects of social intelligence that I was already aware of  but  none the less  there were various anecdotal stories that kept me entertained  whether they were true or not  Here are some takeaways   Give a person a fine reputation to live up to   Example  If you are reliant upon a friend s loyalty  express how you appreciate their loyalty and that you would gamble the house that their loyalty won t become perfidious  This may or may not cause that person to evaluate how important their pseudo reputation is before proving themselves to be disloyal  but at least there is potential for a slight advantage of influence to maintain his or her loyalty  When encountering an argument  don t reverberate back a harsh tone  Most likely  you won t inspire rationality and open mindedness when you are deluged in anger  If you have trouble with insubordination amongst your employees  try praising any slight improvements  criticize indirectly  phrase a command within a question  can you do this for me    lead by example  or invoke a competitive spirit between peer groups  There are many tools the author suggests for this dilemma  Everybody has self importance  Nobody wants to feel like their life is inconsequential  PRINCIPLE 1  Become genuinely interested in other people  PRINCIPLE 2  SmilePRINCIPLE 3  Remember that a person s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language  PRINCIPLE 4  Be a good listener  Encourage others to talk about themselves  PRINCIPLE 5  Talk in terms of the other person s interests  PRINCIPLE 6  Make the other person feel important and do it sincerely   It conveys a simple message to win or to attract or to befriend others  Respect them in a gentle and polite manner genuinely  so that you get what you want from them in the same manner  The sad part is everybody is ready to do this to a stranger but not to their kith s and kin s  Great book for the high school college graduate  Pertinent skills needed for a successful career but more importantly  a successful life  Excellent fundamental book on dealing with people  I ignored it for the title  re thought it  and GLAD I got it  Great for anyone  Especially those who are starting or running their own business  Will keep coming back to this book  This was my second reading of this gem  Some of it is dated but the core of the book holds great wisdom for anyone  My favorite quote   If out of reading this book you get just one thing  an increased tendency to think always in terms of the other person s point of view  and see things from his angle   if you get that one thing out of this book  it may easily prove to be one of the milestones of your career  Enough said  This book is a must read   How to Win Friends   Influence People by Dale CarnegieMy rating  4 of 5 stars How to Win Friends   Influence People by Dale CarnegieMy rating  4 of 5 starsThis is a book that you should keep in your library and revisit regularly  I love the way Dale Carnegie sums up how to behave so that you bring out the BEST in the people you meet and deal with daily He is right   everyone wants to feel important and loved View all my reviewsView all my reviews A friend recommended the book and it as great  It s very hard not to judge this by all the later imitations  This was the original self help book and is mostly interesting from a historical perspective although it includes some good anecdotes  Book Club Read The book is an all containing bible of all psychology and people treating tactics gained over the human experiences It contains everything related to interpersonal skills  Friends  workmates  subordinates and even family The thing which shocked me is that this book is dated back to the 20s of the last century  and that means that the human development sciences are not a NEW focus  aren t they  This book will make you better talker with family friends  people  and business  I learned so much about how to treat people  Basically we all know this if we think about how we want to be treated  We lose site of this with other people and this book helps to bring that back to light  Found a very old edition  signed to my grandfather from Dale Carnegie  Solid advice  This is the best self improvement book I ve read  While that s admittedly a small sample size  I have read enough to know that I generally do not like the genre  This  however  was a lot of fun  Carnegie clearly knows what he s talking about  and practices what he preaches  Plus his narrative approach is refreshing after the overload of superlatives and unlocked secrets found among contemporary writers of these types of books  I definitely recommend this short volume  How to Win Friends and Influence People  by Dale Carnegie  is about how to be a better person in yourself and help other people  As this book talks about a lot of things that the author has encountered in his life  he also talks about the other side of things  and most importantly  how to get what you want  By getting what you want  you also help other people along the way  At the end of the day  you can benefit from your own well being and also help others The main problem that drives this story is a big problem  This problem is getting what you want  For the author  this was a struggle during his younger years  So he later devised a set of principles that have successfully worked for him and drove him towards the common good  These sets of principles are the resolution to this problem  as it winds down from the confusing maze of human psychology into simple words This boo was entertaining for multiple reasons  First  the author talks about the mistakes that he made  which later led to not get what he wants  Second  after revealing his mistakes  he later tells us what he did to turn his mistakes around to successfully get what he wants for the benefit of everyone  The only downside to this book is its setting  In order not to spoil you  this book is very amazing and well written At the end of the day  I would recommend this book to everyone  This book is for people who need a boost in their life and for those who want to improve their relationship in life  It benefits everyone  so take advantage and read this book ASAP  Very practical methodologies However  they are mostly surface issues  The book doesn t address the fundamental issues principles underlying those methodologies  This one has been recommended to me for years  but I didn t expect to like it as much as I did  It really is full of timeless advice about how to lead well  whether you are a mom or a CEO  As an added bonus  the guy who reads the audiobook is a perfect fit  Title is misleading  with manipulative tone when i first read the title but its worthwhile especially if you find yourself wanting to fix or upgrade your social skill  I actually read the hardcover   Good tips  a favorite of my father  but I m still working on winning some friends    Simple  common sensical advice that can be summed up in two words  be nice  It is full of the common knowledge and popular wisdom that permeates our daily lives yet we fail to thoroughly engage in  Like any other good work of literature the book is timeless  Granted  some of the anecdotes are dated  telegraph much   but easily adaptable to the present  I have added the book to my ever growing list of  books that will help me become a better person   Even thought his book was written in 1936  it contains lessons that are important for everyone to learn  I have picked up a few pointers in how to improve my relationships with people  and hopefully I ll be able to create some good habits  Over the decades I have read this one at least 3 times   this time I went through it quickly as a refresher  This book has something to share with each revisit You should read this  really  Good life stradegies  For people looking to hone their communication skills   this book arguably can be called the Holy Grail The principles mentioned by Dale Carnegie for effectively dealing with people are spot on and all of them have passed the test of time with flying colors and still hold true today Most of them are simple and can be translated into real life with little efforts while a few of them demand painstaking efforts to implement Overall   the book affords an amazing insight into people s behavior The book is laden with illustrations from Dale Carnegie s life and other great personalities such as Abraham Lincoln  Theodore Roosevelt  Andrew Carnegie and so on who have harnessed these principles in their lives successfully  Though these illustrations date back to the early 1900 s   they very much resemble the type of situations that people run into in their modern day lives The ideas are constructed with simple and lucid words enabling us to make the best of each and every one of them This is not a type of book that you put aside once you read it If your intentions are to take advantage of the principles mentioned in the book and to be an effective communicator  then this dictates revisiting the concepts in the book every now and then and incessantly practicing them in real life It puzzles to know that such an incredible book is not incorporated as a text book in our academic education and in modern times I think it is a must read for everyone It definitely serves as a perfect guide toward having a sound and healthy professional life as well as an equally good personal life  I picked this book up at the local library just because I ve heard so much about Dale Carnegie  The first few pages of this book tries to sell itself  with the last few pages being a quick reminder that the book was written by a credible author  Finishing the book left me with an impression of the book being a marketing product rather than a work of art Content wise  the book does exactly what it says on the cover   it teaches you how to win people over  no surprise there   The book was first written in 1937 and has since been altered to suit with the change in time  With that said  I wouldn t take anything away from this book other than the concept of being tactful and patient in dealing with people in every circumstance The author gives examples of tactics that Lincoln and himself have used when in tricky  real life  situations  while also noting that these methods used do not guarantee success as situations and individuals may vary with each case    thank you for the disclaimer  I guess  This book gave many quick fixes on how to get along in an environment of different personalities and how to not make life any harder for yourself  and others for that matter  than it already is  albeit provided little insight into bringing a more permanent solution in dealing with difficult people I guess I m a little disappointed after reading this book as it came off as selfishly cunning more than empathetic  Definitely a good book to read to remind yourself that there is always a better way to deal with your emotions to avoid bringing about your own downfall  but not something to make a mantra of Giving this 4 stars because although a little shallow  stuff in this book makes you think a little    Probably the best of the self improvement books  Uplifting and positive  A classic   These lessons are absolutely counter cultural  but so powerful  This is not a book that I will learn from if I just let myself read it once and not pick it back up again  I need to practice these lessons to truly live them out   I know it will be meaningful and worth it   Nice tips and representative stories  the path of kindness and gaining the hearts of others through kindness and empathy  When I started reading this book  I didn t realize it was written in the 1930s  Amazing how timeless these principles of interpersonal communication are  I appreciated the thoughtful  honest approach that Carnegie takes to communicating  Some of his strategies seem crafty  but never insincere  Definitely worth reading this well known book  Good book  Practical  adaptable mindset given  could correlate better to today s world Classic  a great book to pick up every year to help remind you of the importance of direct communication with others  I was pleasantly surprised reading this book  Enjoyed it thoroughly  mn ftrh knt mtn t  n qr h ktb

ll use with friends and when networking How to Win Friends   Influence People  Smile  Don t critize  argue  or correct people  Show appreciation  People love a listener  talk about them and remember their names  If you re wrong admit it asap  Get them to say yes many times before asking big question The first thing Carnegie does is tell the reader to read each chapter twice  I honestly think I would have done this had he not told me  In print since the 30 s  sold millions of copies  his courses are still offered today   you get the point   Husband and I just finished our initial read of this textbook  We have both already started applying some of the principles  I will continue studying it this year  I highly recommend this for any other humans interested in improving their interpersonal and professional relationships  Thank you  I enjoyed this book  It was a little dated  but had good advice  A lot of it seemed obvious  but it was a good reminder to treat other people how you want to be treated  Everyone should read this book especially if your a sales person   This is considered by many friends to be the classic book on human relations   Fantastic book  I loved it

shows the importance of the methods of effective communication for any leader in many aspects of life especially in politics and business  It also shares valuable experiences of great people   Timeless guide on effective communication  most of which is just inferred knowledge from observing what works and what doesn t in social interactions  Excellant read just recommended by my vocation trainer too  If you really want to learn to make a difference to others read this book  Your friends  family members and coworkers will love you for it   This is an easy  pleasant read affirming the golden rule in dealing with others  There is nothing revolutionary or shocking in Carnegie s advice  and yet it reminds us how infrequently we treat others the way we expect to be treated  I suppose critics would argue that Carnegie was Machiavellian in how he recommended people deal with others  but I saw his frequent admonitions for authenticity as reinforcement that each of us must be genuine I may re read this book every couple years just to reconnect with Carnegie s common sense instructions  This book should really be entitled  how to be a better human being   As great as the title is  I think it doesn t target a key audience who this book would help  arrogant people who  of course  feel like they don t need to improve their people skills  Very straight forward and timeless  Dale concise very important aspect of human psychology in a very simple and meticulous manner     qr th mtrjm  lkn  l  l mwm hw ktb bh qSS jyd   l  mjl ksb lSdq Re read this for a book group and it is just as good the second time  though it does make you feel like you can be a good salesman and that doesn t apply to my life right now  but other common courtesy things do  like not criticizing and giving honest and sincere appreciation  Good stuff  Good positive info  This is a must read book folks  I really enjoyed reading this book  Dale Carnegie tells you his simple and effective techniques to win and influence people  He give you some best examples as well  We wanted to become important to others but we don t pay attention to them  We always concentrate on ourselves  This is book is a nice lesson to us  These are my favourite quotes in this book   Talk to someone about themselves and they ll listen for hours   and  Make people feel important and do it sincerely   ABSOLUTELY TRUE isn t it  No suelo leer libros de este tipo  pero como fue un regalo   La verdad  termino gustandome mucho la idea del autor  y encontre muchas frases de interes encerradas en el libro  Such a classic that it s a clique  in the US  at least   I referred to it in another review so I should point out that I have read it and thought it actually gives very timely advice     What was most interesting about this book for me was that it was published more than 80 years ago but it s as timely now as it was then  The psychological concepts of interpersonal relationships are so well explained and presented with interesting narrative examples of the concepts in action In the last 20 years or so we ve become such a  Me  me  me    society that this book reminds us of how to be better people  better friends  better employers  better employees  Given the state of the job market today we need all the help we can get too What isn t mentioned  at least not in the edition I read  is the connection between the principles discussed and spirituality  Today there is a greater trend towards increasing our awareness of those outside ourselves and putting others first  This is the crux of Carnegie s method Much of what he outlines is basic common sense and decency in dealing with others that we forget all about when we are after fulfilling our own needs as quickly as possible  We completely forget  if we have even ever realized  that attending to others  interests furthers our own as well  The negative reviews for this book are hilarious   The book is full of extremely practical advise on how you can improve on all aspects of your social interactions both privately and in business  The premise of the book is not about manipulating others  but instead showing how you yourself can become a better  social  person by following simple rules  I truly believe that taking the discussed points in the book into practice will positively change your life and I m already actively applying some of this newly found wisdom  A minor point of critique is that a lot of anecdotes are being described in the book and not all of them are that interesting  which is probably in part due to the time in which the book was written  almost a century ago   Also quite some points seem to overlap a lot and repetition of all sort is spread throughout the book  which also helps hitting the points home    Really great read Great business book  its principles are timeless and relevant to both personal and professional life  Read it as part of a marketing team book club and it served as a great refresher on basic business etiquette and human psychology     kyfy  lt ml m  lnsd  lqlq w bd lHy kyf tksb lSdqfn lkhTb kyf tksb lthq  w tw thr blns This book is as relevant now as it was when first written over 70 years ago  Dale Carnegie uses many anecdotes  usually surprising ones involving very famous historical figures  to illustrate the fundamental principles of human relations in this book  Amazing book  The autor speaks with easy vocabulary so if you are a beginner reading books in English this is a good one for start with  Not nearly as wanky as I thought it d be  Mostly self evident   but interesting to read the classic  A classic  In the beginning  it seems like a boring one  But i was wrong  The more i read  the more i learn This book gives me lots of useful tips Great one   Short

Oops entry in wrong book Getwijfeld tussen drie en vier sterren  wegens hier en daar toch wat verouderd of al te simplistisch voorgesteld  Los daarvan  wel behoorlijk wat boeiende inzichten in de menselijke psyche  dus wel graag gelezen   Excellent book  The principles are priceless and have stood the test of time  While technology has affected how some things are executed  there is no question to the value of the personal connections and considerations promoted by Dale Carnegie I read this book a few years back and I really liked it  At the same time I couldn t really decide on if it s ok or not to  fake  your personality in a way that makes people like you more  Dale writes that you should be sincere about the personality changes that is proposed in the book but it sometimes feels more like something that is added so the changed behaviour would stand out to be too manipulative I wasn t able to put my finger on what it was that felt wrong with this book until I read Stephen R  Coveys book  The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People  Powerful Lessons in Personal Change  a month ago In the beginning of this book Covey divides personal development books into two cathegories  Books focusing on character ethics and books focusing on personality ethics  This division along with the fact that I had already read the book he refers to when he refers to character ethics  The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin  made it all make sense to me How to win friends and influence people is a personal development book that focuses on personality ethics  It does not however focus on how to build the character that is needed to live up to these ethics in a sincere way If you make the personality changes according to these books without having the character behind it to make them sincere you risk that people will judge you as manipulative and that they get this feeling about you that you many times get about sales people that they don t really want what s in your best interest I really recommend reading all three of these books however and see if you see the same connections that I see  ktb jmyl ydhkr fyh qw d jmyl  llt ml m  lns wksbhm    b D lmthl  b ydh  n lwq     w njH lqw d mrtbT btqn lq d  w tqbl lmjtm  lh    lkn bl mwm lqw d mfydh w Hlw n trj  lh wtlkhSh I feel guilty now  I know how to influence my friends to do things my way  That thought isn t very comforting  This book spoke to me  It s a veritable primer on human interaction  But the danger with this kind of work is that it s possible to reduce these interactions to mere supeficial techniques and lose sight of the substance  Well worth reading especially if you want to lead and not manage people  Leaders have people follow them managers just tell you what to do  I can always use advice and varying approaches to communicating effectively with people at different organizational and socioeconomic levels  I picked up several tips from this work and will be employing them going forward   Some of the references  especially the view of women  are very dated and representative of the time the book was written  But  the advice  overall  is timeless  The main ideas are in the bulleted list at the end of each part and each chapter just contains anecdotes that illustrate the point  So you can skim the points and read only the anecdotes that particularly interest you if you d like  This is one book which you will always find with me  I just love reading this book A great book    The Golden Rule works     Though maybe slightly outdated in some aspects  it still has a lot of very practical advice  It s a shame  the simple yet smart concepts in this book seem too often overlooked in today s society  7 10 Most of what is said is evident  But that s good to have it all reminded  This could be summarized as  a kind word can warm even the coldest of hearts   A must read for anyone trying to better themselves  Once you change your thought process  you change your life   Be hearty in your approbation and be lavish in your praise    While the title makes it sound like you re going to manipulate people  the actual book is more about how to change yourself and practically be the kind of person that wins friends and influences others  For that it is worth reading  After reading this book  I realized why I don t have many friends  I realized all these bad things that I do subconsciously that repel people  I can t just expect people to be my friend if I don t put myself out there  Here are some lessons I learned from this book   don t complain or criticize  appreciate  make people feel important and focus on their interests  listen more than you talk  don t argue  see things from their perspective  and more  I know I should apply these lessons to life  but it feels hard  I need to get brave enough and confident enough to  I don t know  Well now I know how to get along with people but it s easier said than done  So to win friends  I have to stop critizing directly and start praising people s real accomplishments  Talking about 180deg turns  how to get rid of these  friends   after being so nice to them You know  once I hit my personal Dunbar s number of about a dozen  less friends are better   But to be fair and objective and everything The part about influencing people broadened my horizon Thanks Dale  I ll try emulating your attitude and see what happens  Very simple philosophies that can be implemented immediately  It s a great reminder  and expounds upon things you knew and may have forgotten  Sometimes obvious things need to be pointed out to people 1  Smile when you see someone 2  Listen to people s stories  Let them talk about themselves 3  Send a thank you note even when it s not necessary I read this book when I was 19 and put just a few of its basic practices into place and my life really improved for the better  Interesting read  Carnegie provides plenty of anecdotal evidence for his claims  You will basically get the picture after a few chapters in  Most of the book is reinforcing the core values of making others feel important  actually listening and absorbing the words of others  and not criticizing anyone ever  The first thing that came into my mind after finishing the book is why I didn t read it any earlier  I wish I had read it  10  years ago  but thank God it s never too late Well  this book is very important for those who must handle their relationships with care and need to get their desires fulfilled while dealing with others What I liked about the book s content is that doesn t promote a manipulative type of character to its readers  This is a brief summary of the book Techniques for handling people Don t criticize or complainShow honest appreciation Arose an eager want in the other people6 Principles for making people like you 1  Be genuinely interested in other people 2  Smile 3  Remember the other person s name and how it holds great influence 4  Be a

Use encouragement  Make the fault seem easy to correct 9  Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest  Strategies from the ultimate networking guru  You ll find practical applications to use in both your professional and personal life  Would be very surprised if you were disappointed by this book   I really learned alot reading this book  I learned alot about my self and how I should interact more with people on a more possitive level  asked one word to describe How to win friends and influence people  I will definitely choose  inspiring   While some of the same kind only list out the  Do  and  Don t  things this book briefly demonstrate the ideas through various examples and stories  I did not have to try much to remember the theories and instead had the chance to analyze and understand them in my own ways  Sometime I got confused when some ideas are repeated throughout the books  some more than twice  as if the writer really wanted to emphasize them in the reader s minds  Maybe to me the book doesn t word out the way it ought to  because the greatest thing I learn from this book is not how to influence people but that it does not take much time and effort to show our beloved ones that we truly care for them  Although this idea is written in this book as a fundamental rule in communicating and influencing people  just as the book is meant to teach people to behave in a way so that others will love and corporate with them  I realize that while practicing this  I am the first to feel happy and satisfied  I do not intend to influence anyone or to win their love  I just know through the stories in the that there re are great many ways to show our affections and feelings for others  and that it takes time to develop the HABIT of caring for their problems instead of ours  While reading the Second Chapter  I felt the urge to stand up and call my sister who has been in the hospital the whole week taking after my grandad  to text another sister who is working hard at her office  to send my friends and teachers e cards at the Valentine and to think positively about the recently problems in my family  I don t know if I will be able to have impacts on anyone  but this book has inspired me live more selflessly  and as Gandhi once said  be the change you want to see in the world  may this be a good sign   The book should be renamed as  How to be Kind to people   A classic Kinda dry  but very informative  Still wort reading despite its somewhat simplistic and archaic view of the world  An incredible book that talks about simple stuff which we generally tend to ignore while dealing with people  Through this book we understand how important and imperative  yet simple these techniques are which can be easily applied in everyday life  This book is a must read   This was one of the best discussions we ever had for our book group  ktb lTyf  w bh kthyr mn l mthlh lqryb l fhm  w lkn l mthl  mrtbT  jd blmjtm  l mryky A little dated  but I believe it is a fundamental book that everyone should read  All college freshman should read this as a basis for a professional life  Better than Michael Scott s book  How I Manage   which book does not really exist  but I wanted to reference it anyway  Being one of the most popoular book about interpersonal psychology  I had some doubts about it  But I wanted to read it and so I did  And I have to say it made me think about how I communicate with other people  a lot  Not because I need a better position at my work or I need to  collect  friends  but just how brutal the communication is novadays  We just don t know what to say at the right place  at the right time  I am very happy I found this book for myself and I guess  now and then  I am going to read it again

still relevant  this book delivers a can do attitude with a positive life mind set  I think it should be mandatory reading for all middle school students  One of the best books I ve ever read  If you can get past all the  true stories  then you ll easily take away a lot from this book  I often catch myself putting the principles into practise without even realising it  Well recommended  i have learnt quite a bit from this book  I recommended this book to my dad  Undoubtedly he s one of the best human relation expert and an author all time  He s words are eye openers to all  Common sense stuff about relating with other people  from the perspective of positive emotions and attitude  Lots of great examples of known and common people  I still utilize and keep in mind every principle I have learned from this book in m social life One of the most powerful lessons is SMILE   just SMILE at every body s face n watch the MAGIC of SMILE affecting your relationships with your classmates  friends  family and your own self   SMILE    Another book that should be required reading for anyone starting their career  Following these rules will make you more authentic and consequently more successful   My new boss LOVES this book  so I figured it was something worth knowing  Turns out I already know this stuff   listen to people  respect them  care about them  Done  Outstanding and differently a read for all  It is a very good book  I recommend upon finishing each chapter or upon getting to the  In a Nutshell  section to take those advices and test them out  because  personally  I wasn t touched until I saw the difference happen before my eyes  Maybe you re better than me  for me that proved to be a good method My mother bought me this book when I was in jr  high  to help me try and make more friends  It s not the best book in the world  but it has a soft spot in my heart because of this  It s cool to read the book that is the foundation for the entire universe of self help books  And the advice is still sound  I love Dale Carnegie books  Many of his points are timeless and incredibly wise  I really like Dale Carnegie s books  the positive stories that showcase real world application of techniques make for a great read  My first guide to interpersonal skills  Very interesting stories and yet practical when it came to implementation  Most of all  what makes this book memorable is my first grasp on presentations  Have pleasant memories with this book   Good book  I recognize people in my own life that I look up to that use these techniques and recognize the benefit  Gives lots of examples  Even from history   At worst this is a collection of charming anecdotes about people being nice to each other with the word  salesman  scattered randomly about  At best it is a life changing guide for social interaction and understanding  For me  it is admittedly closer to the latter and I m completely and happily surprised by that  The title is totally misleading  and while it does have a mind for business  this book precedes the cynicism of the self help era and names its heroes as historical figures who always asked their butler how Barbara  his mother  was fairing  The author  Carnegie  calls us  and himself  out repeatedly as simple creatures who just want a little appreciation and have a lot of pride  and reminds that everyone else is just the same  Pay a complement  remember a name  let the other person talk his heart out  let him save face  and here s a meandering story about Lincoln and letter writing to illustrate the point  My favorite aspect  and the attitude that really structures the philosophy  is the rule that a person should strive to  although there is no assumption that this is difficult in practice  develop a genuine interest in others  There is an inherent belief in humanity and the idea that reader has plenty to gain from learning about others  Charming  optimistic  engaging  Good read to start off a new year  Gyr fy Hjt ktyr    Just Amazing Great book  full of lessons that seem obvious but need to be acted on more often  Some of the lessons are very similar  but the repetition does help to emphasize Carnegie s memo  Will read again and again  good to learn about interpersonal relationships   seems to belong to the classics in the field   Clear presentation  Easy to follow examples    Useful book  It s a must read not only if you want to win friends and influence people  It helps you build empathy and think beyond yourself and your ego  It helps you learn how to behave with consciousness   A self improvement classic that I ve had on my shelf for a long time and finally got around to reading  Great suggestions for relating to others  I have to admit that Carnegie s writing style isn t my favorite  but the content is worthwhile which makes it worth reading  Good tips on interaction with others  This book taught me social manipulation   exactly what I expecte4d  but almost in a touching way  Definitely an enjoyed read  Useful advice  More of a book on how to make a good impression on strangers  A mix of good ideas mixed with what slight manipulation techniques  Take the book with a grain of salt and you will enjoy it more  My favorites were  use and instead of but  and  say a compliment before giving a criticism   My pet peeve would have to be that the author never comes across as someone who cares about the reader  He rarely opens up at all in the book and when he does it is to prove a point in the chapter  I feel a book about making friends should be well   more friendly  However  overall a solid and informative read  I am all for keepin  it real  and this book keep it reals by shedding light on the importance of tactfulness  Truthspitting has no use unless it is effective  and efficacy often requires the art of tactfulness  Read this book to learn how you can make the most out of every situation through sincerity and careful thought  ktb ry   wmmtz l  Hd b yd wmwD th shlh wbsyTh wnSH lqr bqrh hdh lktb  Really a good book  Has helped me a lot in my general outlook of life and the people who make it   Nothing in this book is revolutionary  Every principle is obvious  but it s still charming  The references to Rockefeller and Woodrow Wilson are outdated  Swap them for names like Buffet or Gates and the morals remain true  It s clearly a classic and after  finally  reading it  I see why  I didn t learn anything particularly new  but it served as a great reminder of all the things I should be doing but often don t   Iznenadvashcho za samata men  knigata

people successfully in any situation I read this two years ago but it never made it into Goodreads  I only noticed because I pulled it off my shelf this evening to give it another go  A great read that gives insight into the subtle nature of human emotions  A practical and applicable book on personal relations that everyone could learn something from  Easy to read and definitely worthwhile  Would probably be worth reading annually  This is one of those books that I have always meant to read but life got in the way  Now was perfect time to read this book and I hope to apply some of these lessons to my life   Great book  Good book on how to better interact with people  Just make sure that your intentions are not just to make people to like you but to have meaningful relationships with others  How to Win     has a lot of great advice and is a must read for most people  The Chapters are very simple  as are a lot of the concepts  but it s amazing how useful some of the advice can be  Even though certain ideas are simple  they re very easy to forget or just to never really think about  but Carnegie helps you start thinking about how to go about your daily interactions with people

bqrath great book that taught me lots and reinforced things I d been taught my whole life   Oh if only the principals in this book were widely practiced  this would would be a happier place  What I loved about this book is that it does not have the typical icky self help book feel  Its instead Dale exhorting us to show genuine interest in others  respect them  really listen  make their interest your own interest  Seek to see things from their point of view  give genuine affirmation and praise  never criticize or argue  believe the best about them  humble yourself and be quick to confess your faults  etc    I suppose it can all be summed up in  Love your neighbor as yourself  and also the scripture  If you seek to find your life  you ll lose it  but if you lose your life for my sake  you ll find it  comes to mind  for the way to find life  is to not seek it  but to give yourself away  As Jesus said   If you want to become first  you must become a servant to all   though this is not a religious book  I just feel Carnegie does an amazing job of showing how its really in our own best interest to deny ourselves and prefer others before ourselves  I absolutely loved this book  Still worth reading  Really good to be reminded of some of the little things we need to do for others  Part OneFundamental Techniques in Handling PeoplePrinciple 1   Don t criticize  condemn or

well as being an author I also run my own training and business consultancy business and I just could live without this classic book when delivering  sales and management training sessions  I have recommended it to many of my delegates  A classic book that has not dated  The book has good tips  but I think they are mostly useful on a business situation  For friends and the like I think that it s better to tell the simple truth sometimes then trying to convince everyone with small talk  BECOME A FRIENDLIER PERSON1  Don t criticize  condemn or complain 2  Give honest  sincere appreciation 3

sociopathy  Oops  scratch that  I meant sales talk Wait  change it  I meant social engineering No  gimme a sec    friend making  Yup  Got it Entry level sociopathy  Great book with relevant information on how to build successful human relations  qr th f  trjmth l rby     w jbn  wqdm fkr Hmyl  f  r D mmtz  A book that makes you overlook what life is and what you make of it   When the great Peter Malherbe  newsman to the bone  left his positon at the Sunday Times  he handed me this book  His words  knowing that journalists are somewhat cynical of this sort of business mumbo jumbo  were something along the lines of  Read it  It s actually very useful   I did and it was The book s core message is that you can force people to do things  you can exercise power over them to bend them to your will  but if you really want the best out of them  you need to find out what it is that drives them and match that drive to your objectives  In short  you must understand what it is that they want  And  in many instances  the desire isn t for money  It s for recognition  being listened to  and being acknowledged  Once you take that approach  it s amazing how the doors open  the atmosphere lightens and things get done Did it change my life  Not really  Did it change the way I see people in the workplace  Absolutely  mn  Hsn lktb fy lt ml m  lns  I m re reading it again  because I figure I d have to polish my social interaction skills with other college students  Surprisingly  the first time I read this book I gave this book a meager evaluation of three stars  I have no idea what I was thinking  But  upon revisiting  I came to appreciate Carnegie s overabundant anecdotes that cut directly to the nub of the advice he s imparting  He doesn t take you on a garden walk like Murakami does  He addresses the issue and constantly engages the reader with his endless supplies of stories  But  another way of enriching the reading experience  is to apply the methods to real life scenarios  And  so far  that has been working tremendously well for me  Therefore  I think I ve earned invaluable insights from this book  It a always good to revisit old books  The forgetfulness of my memory is quite astonishing  Okay  I m going off tangent  4 5 it is   Ever since I start reading this book last 2 years  it has been my permanent item in my handbag  Very useful when I encounter problems with people  this book was a good book for information on social and family and friends and how to get far in the world  dale carnegie in a great author and this is a classic  this is my parents favorite book  the book is awesome written in a very optimistic way  useful to people who are in the bussiness field or anyone in whose life socialising or contacts make a difference very good book  it teaches us to think in other s perspective and turn situations in favour  Es muy bueno  facil de entender los conceptos  aunque los ejemplos hay que saber un poco de historia de USA pero muy muy poco  solo hace referencia  como tipico libro de usa solo es para darle un mayor sentido  La sensacion que me dejo fue de querer leerlo otra vez porque es mucha informacion y como bien dice el libro hay que hojearlo de vez en cuando  This is a great book  I ve read it multiple time since I got it and refer to it once in a while to gain perspective  It comes in four  Parts   each containing a few sub sections  Each Part is then summarized at the end for future quick reference  Mostly common sense presented in good context  Once you start following it you won t even realize that you re actually doing a lot of what s in it  This book has been on my  to read  list ever since college    I m a little embarrassed to admit how long it has taken me to actually get to it  but I m so glad I finally did  Not only is it great information for strengthening interpersonal relationships and dealing with people in everyday life  but it has also given me some good ideas on how to tweak some of my parenting techniques  Wow do I suck at chapter 1  Gotta work on that  This might be something to read more than once   The book  How to Win Friends and Influence People  by Dale Carnegie in this author explained his different principles how to handle people  how to make people like you  how to make a good impression with people  how to win people to your way of thinking etc    Few good quotes which i liked in this book are don t criticise people  condemn  or complain  give honest and sincere appreciation and respect other opinion  He also explained all his principles with example and explained how to develop the ability to deal people and maintain a friendly relationship with people  I really enjoyed reading this book and it was also so inspiring  Thank you  I ve learned a lot  bout how to communicate with others from this book  It is a really good book to read  The stories are interesting and meaningful  It s like a bible for businesshumans  One of the greatest books must be read by everyone  I learned a LOT from this book  I had to read it as a mandatory book for a families class  but I m so glad that I did  Already my confidence when talking to others has increased  and I can thank it all to this book   amreading  Inspiring author and book  A must read  Worth Reading  Title is mismatching though its not how to win friends its all about how to learn your friends and influence people  written in 1936 however this is a book of the millennium  Simple concepts but definitely can make big difference in you personally  This book will guide you through how to learn about people and how you can read them  Anyone can easily rip the essence of this book  this is that  SIMPLE  and helps you to make you an effective leader  Worth reading and highly recommended to everyone   Much better than 48 Laws of Power Highly recommended  Why do people hate this book  right off the bat  Because nobody likes to think that someone else could use a formula to trick you into being friends with or influenced by that person  The problem with this book is that it is structured in a way that implies each principle can work independently of the others  It s unfortunate that Dale Carnegie made this mistake while organizing the book  he even goes so far as to give examples in each section of the principles working  independently  that sometimes sound extremely unrealistic  Almost all of the principles he provides are excellent ideas but the most important thing  and this is something I think Carnegie should have stressed in every chapter and not just the first and last  is obviously sincerity  Don t bullshit people  Say what you came to say  That PROVIDED  being a good listener can take you a long way  Many of Carnegies ideas are RE active suggestions  you can t just trot into someone s office and ask a person what his or her hobbies are  Get to the point If you re willing to do a little bit of the work for the author and put 2 and 2 together  The principles work as a group of ideas rather than independently  then you will gain a lot from this book  Since reading it and being in scenarios where there was explicit or implicit haggling involved  let s face it  most of life is some form of bargaining  I ve found these tools to be 10000  relevant  And have definitely gained from them  I highly recommend this book for people who would like to have more friends and influence by means of sincerity  I don t UN recommend this for the insincere  I just know that no matter how hard they may try to manipulate their peers  it ll eventually come back to bite them in the ass       review after having read a few chapters      Despite the voice of an author reaching into 2010 from almost 100 years ago  I m finding this book to be incredibly apt and frankly just darling in tone  The author has an earnest and affable voice that makes me happy to pick the book back up  Each chapter offers advice that I can apply immediately and from which I consistently find immediate satisfaction  The author hazards against insincerity or artificiality in applying his suggestions  making this book 100  genuine  I m not half way through but I can already tell this will be a favorite  Audiobook I wanted to give this book 3 stars   WHAT  Only 3 stars for this gem  How can you      is what I hear you saying  Yes  I  too  had very high hopes for this book  And I liked it  That s what 3 stars mean  I liked it  To rate it higher  there were a couple of things missing   Fewer examples  Carnegie is really giving a lot of examples  up to a point where I d say   Enough  I get it  Please  no more      More science  I agree with most of his points  however  he s not backing most of them up with science  There s a few references to B F  Skinner s behavioral theories  but not much more   Clearer advice  maybe because the lack of scientific reference in the book  I find a few of his principles questionable  Part 3   12  Throw down a challenge   is not what I want other people do to me  I can do that fine by myself  thank you   Part 4   2  Call attention to people s mistakes indirectly   is what I usually try to avoid  since I value open and direct communication  Part 4   3  Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person   seems to me like what I know as  sandwich feedback   i e  giving negative feedback between giving positive feedback at the beginning and at the end of a conversation  Carnegie addresses this problem with principle 4 3 though  which he sees in not giving _sincere_ positive feedback  But then again  I might have only received insincere positive feedback when receiving sandwich feedback Other than that  I really liked the book  If it were a tad smaller  fewer examples   it s a really good summary of behaviours to hold dear in life  All the other principles in this book are  from my experience and point of view  very much something to strive for when developing oneself  4 stars it is The principles discussed in this book are  via http   en wikipedia org wiki How_to_W      Part  Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1  Don t

muitos casos  mas muitas vezes nao agimos da maneira mais obvia e inteligente quando lidamos com pessoas  Um livro que continua atual e necessario mesmo depois de 100 anos de seu lancamento  Such timeless ideas  Manusia diciptakan berbeda satu sama lain  Itu membuat manusia menjadi makhluk yang rumit sekaligus mudah dipahami  Walaupun diciptakan dengan watak dan perilaku yang berbeda  tetapi ada satu hal mendasar yang pasti dimiliki oleh semua manusia  Yakni sifat manusia untuk ingin selalu dianggap sebagai orang yang penting  Simpelnya  semua orang ingin dihargai  Nasihat dari buku ini

reading  maby just a bit outdated in some aspects of how the author  talks  to the reader I try to read it at least once biannually  I read this book throughout the entire year to try to better myself  This book was actually very helpful  It s not just a one time read though  it s much suited for a reference book after you read it through  The idea is to go back to chapters and recalling how to behave and interact during situations  It s easy to see how this book has remained influential for almost 80 years  It is literally a summary of everything I ve learned working in customer service  which means I know that it s all true  It s a lot of common sense  anything business related usually is  but I think I needed the reminder  I can name a lot of people who do too  Its a common book

perspective on how to interact with different people and the advice given are extremely practical  Recommendable  First published in 1936  this is a classic American self help book  Despite being a product of its time  I think most of the ideas continue to be relevant  It discusses the following principles Handling people   1  Don t criticize  condemn or complain   2  Give honest and sincere

it s hard to put in practice  and it s hard to do all of this stuff sincerely  It basically doesn t work if you re being phony  This book points out that you need to genuinely appreciate other people  you can t just flatter them These kinds of books make me think about a couple of core concepts we re all taught and what they really mean  The first is in this book  The author points out  probably the most important rule in the world  Do unto others as you would have others do unto you   I think that s obviously true in a very general sense  give others what they want  just as you would want others to give you what you want  But it s untrue that you should literally do unto others as you would have others do unto you  because others are different from you  You should do unto others as others would have you do unto them  There are only a small minority of people who are similar to me and want the same things I want  I need to figure out what other people want and give that to them  not give them what I would want The second is  Thou shalt not lie   I m very literal  so telling people what they want to hear  and not telling people what I m really thinking seems like lying to me  I know that most people don t think of  white lies  as being lies at all  they just think of them as an expression of kindness  For me  one thing that is difficult about applying the principles of a book like this is to remember that for most people  in a lot of situations  the literal words that come out of someone s mouth are irrelevant  they actually  don t count  as even being part of the communication  The actual communication is in the person s body language and tone of voice  I think of lot winning friends and influencing people comes down to telling what people consider to be socially appropriate white lies  and telling them with convincing body language and tone of voice  Ideally  this can be pulled off without actually lying  rather than saying the hurtful thing you are really thinking  you say something different that is actually true  At times  I think this requires an almost zen like detachment from one s own feelings and emotions  to get what you want  never express what you actually want or feel  I think that no matter how many books a person reads  it s hard for a person who is actually not compassionate to come across as being compassionate  Part One  Fundamental Techniques in Handling PeopleDon t criticize  condemn  or complain   It rarely helps the situation Give honest sincere appreciation Arouse in the other person an eager want Part Two  Six Ways To Make People Like YouBecome genuinely interested in other people Smile Remember that a person s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language Be a good listener  Encourage others to talk about themselves   This is the secret to being a great conversationalist  Talk in terms of the other person s interests Make the other person feel important  and do it sincerely Part Three  Win People To Your Way Of ThinkingThe only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it   Because even if you win  you aren t going to get what you want  Show respect for the other person s opinions  Never say   You re wrong  If you are wrong  admit it quickly and emphatically   A good way to start is to admit that you could be mistaken  Begin in a friendly way Get the other person saying  yes  yes  immediately Let the other person do a great deal of the talking Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers Try honestly to see things from the other person s point of view Be sympathetic with the other person s ideas and desires Appeal to the nobler motives   Even if deep down they make the decision based on the baser ones  Everyone wants to be the hero of their own story  Dramatize your ideas   A picture and a story are worth a thousand words  Throw down a challenge   Do this when all else fails   Part Four  Be A Leader  How To Change People Without Giving Offense Or Arousing ResentmentBegin with praise and honest appreciation Call attention to people s mistakes indirectly Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person Ask questions instead of giving direct orders Let the other person save face Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement  Be  hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise  Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to Use encouragement  Make the fault seem easy to correct Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest  Great ideas to keep in mind when working with others Great book   but the ONLY section that would NOT work for corporate America today is  If you are wrong  admit it quickly and emphatically   Working for corporate   everyone knows if you take responsibility for a blow up  it s a mark on your record and you can get fired for it  That s something I learned from my boss   make sure you know how to play the game   make sure you cover your bases so that you don t get blamed for anything because the second you do  it can cost you that promotion or even your job Amazing book  the only problem is that the other party must be human to reciprocate and understand your intentions  nowadays in corporations it s difficult to be treated as human being and expect corporate to treat you like one  but following these steps will definitely help Sometimes the book seems naive at heart compared to how the world has changed today   how it interacts  corporations  internet  etc    but overall the same principles apply Other sections were very interesting in the sense that they were very manipulative   you have to understand this book was written to help navigate politics of the workplace  but whether you use these techniques for altruistic reasons are completely up to you  Some of the anecdotes about Charles Schwab  Andrew Carnegie  and others were very interesting in the sense that they were terrible people who settled disputes through manipulation using these techniques  Again Carnegie never claimed to be a moral or ethical person  he wrote this book so that you can SEEM more pleasant and ethical in the workplace    For most readers this fact is lost on them  and people use these techniques in positive ways for good reasons  and even Carnegie insists of using empathy to connect with others  If you use these techniques for good that s all that matters  Definitely apply to your everyday  I think this book should be read by everyone  every single person on the planet  That s how good it is  I read this book a few years ago as part of a Dale Carnegie leadership training program I attended for my job at the time  I was moving into more of a managerial role and my boss was into these kinds of interpersonal skill building exercises  This is the same course where they teach you to use word association to remember people s names  The only name I remember now was this hot girl Meghan Ardnt because I figured I  aren t makin   any headway with this one once I found out she was married  The format of the course forced us to try out the tools laid out in the book because we would have to give a five minute speech about how we used a particular skill that was discussed the previous week and what the results were  All about stepping out of our comfort zone  One dude stormed out circa week 9 never to be seen again  I think his name was Stormy The book is about techniques you can use if you re managing anyone  if you re working as part of a team  if you re in sales  or even if you re in  sales   The same techniques are just as applicable in everyday life as well  Some examples  Use a person s name when talking to them  it s the most important sound in any language  It works  How many people do that  I can count the number I know personally on one hand  It gets attention and makes them feel important Let the other person feel that the idea is his own  It works  Try leading somebody down the path to what you want them to do instead of outright telling them what to do  Ask question you know the answer to  Nobody likes taking orders  everybody likes to think they are in control  Trickster Use encouragement  Make the fault seem easy to correct  It works  Kinda  Praise for the slightest improvement seems to keep hope up for people but sometimes it s hard to put a positive spin on the situation after say the second or third job you lost because of your serious drinking problem I highly recommend this book  While it is easy enough to find the principles listed out online  the book gives real life examples from Dale and his students  lives  His enthusiasm makes you want to run out and try them right away  Even if you don t have an opportunity to try them all if you pick out two or three to use  you ll see positive results  Sometimes it s fun just to see how far you can manipulate people using as many principles as possible in one situation  Good at parties   try it  I have a friend who thinks this is phony bologna  On the other hand  I see it as a really worthwhile read  Whatever the difference  perhaps I was much more lacking in my networking skills and interpersonal relationship savvy  Maybe I just have the ability to get the good out of a wider variety of sources  Who knows   I loved reading the many personal stories that Mr  Carnegie used to explain the points he makes about successful ways of being for greatest benefit to relationships  I come into this reading with the interest to communicate more effectively the love and appreciation I have for those around me  If I were reading it as part of a marketing class  I would indeed feel phony  I think Dale Carnegie has a lot of wonderful personal insights and I appreciate very much having read this book  At first I thought this book was deceptive and was teaching ways to trick people into getting what they want  I also thought this book was for sad and lonely people that wanted friends  Turns out  the book is rather honest  insightful and explains how human relations work to a certain extent  Although there are bits and pieces that personally I think cannot be applied nowadays  most of it shed some light into human behaviour and on how to deal with conflicting interests  This book is a self help book for teenage girls  and this is the 2nd self help book I ve read this year  Basically  Donna Dale Carnegie wrote this book to help teenage girls learn how to make friends  The author is trying to say  and is saying  what we need to work on in order to be positively influential to other people  as a  sister  daughter  friend  and girlfriend  as she says   You can call this an exposition considering how the author analyzes how we  as teenage girls  handle ourselfs in certain situations  She gives genuine steps to being a positive  friendly  and social  role model  I like this book  I wouldn t change a thing about it  I needed a book like this because I don t have any friends  and I never really did because of how antisocial I am  I tried to make friends during this year but I didn t feel like It was going anywhere  so I quit  I think that I should give this a 2nd chance now that I ve read this book and there is nothing that I don t like about the book  It s not similar to a book that I ve read before besides  Your Medical Mind  considering these are both self help books  but maybe that s beccause I don t read that much  I d recommend this book to teenage girls everywhere who need help making friends  Interesting book  though the number of examples can be a bit much  It all seems like common sense  but how much do you actually use  Read this in conjunction with the Dale Carnegie class and thought it was great  superb book  I will heed the advice to read it again and study further  I enjoyed this book because much of it was stuff I already knew subconsciously but didn t practice on a regular basis  This book made me realize how much different my life would be if I practice these principles on a daily basis  which I am doing now  buku ini bagus buat orang yang ingin bersosialisasi dengan banyak orang  saya dapat banyak pelajaran dari buku ini paling tidak saya dapat beberapa tips untuk bisa lebih baik dalam berkomunikasi  coba aja baca  This book should be made mandatory for every person who graduates from high school  Simply because the suggestions given in this can in fact influence people  I have already started using some of them and it s having a profound effect  Useful  misogynistic I first read this book in 2002 when I took Leadership Training for Managers at Dale Carnegie Training  The concept in this book is always valid  To have good human relationships  we need to understand others by putting our feet in their shoes  Ho trovato questo libro molto interessante  anche se a volte un po  ripetitivo  Consiglio comunque questa lettura  Awesome Template for all the walks in life  may it be climbing corporate ladder  or strengthening personal relationship  this books is a great guide  Loved it    Excellent Self help book  very relevant and helpful  This book is a wonderful reminder of all the things we should be doing when we converse with family  friends and co workers  If you truly like people and want to keep them around you are probably already doing these things  I didn t quite believe all the stories  Being nice makes a huge difference in how people interact with you but it may not land you a multi million dollar deal as portrayed in this book  Nevertheless  doing these things will improve any relationship in your life and is worth reading for that reason  I do want to mention I didn t like the title of this book      This is an oldie but goodie  The principles covered by Carnegie are timeless  Now  to put them to practice    Can be summed up as put others first  People love the sound of their own name  to be the centre of attention  to feel important  to feel affirmed and acknowledged  Lots of useful tips for being an effective communicator and leader  Wish I had read this 13 years ago when my high school teacher referenced it   A book too well known for its own good  for you judge it as a very unnecessary read  unless you have real interaction issues It more often than not states the obvious  being nice to people and learn not to criticise will go a long way into getting others to like you Yet  no matter how obvious the principles  seeing them written somehow makes them clearer  and you start to realise how often you can react the wrong way  or the less productive one  The many examples given finish to convince you to apply them  or at least to try your best to A must read for anyone who wants to change their behavioural patterns  or just learn how to better interact with other people  Really enjoyed this one  thought it was insightful  rGm ny m fDl ktb tTwyr ldht wlkn dyl mrnyjy Gyr nZrty    ktb ry   wystHq lqr   Interesting read  Dale Carnegie is one of those writers who writes as he speaks  you can imagine him talking directly to you   Honestly  a lot of the information in this book is common sense  but it is definitely good to get a reminder  Good book with good concepts  Dale was an interesting guy  The name of the book to me is somewhat odd as well  It actually prevented me from reading it for some time  However  the name is misleading  Or maybe a trap for those who are actually wanting to read a book with that name      Although this book was written some a few decades ago  the principles still apply today  In fact  you can use these principles as part of your business social media marketing plan    A very easy read to be sure  With a book that has been around this long and is this popular  there is not much new here  I have watched for years so many people mishandle what is taught and directed in this book  This is not an instruction manual  it is a philosophy  It should be implemented and treated as such  The author says it best   Remember  we all crave appreciation and recognition  and will do almost anything to get it  But nobody wants insincerity  Nobody wants flattery   I am of the opinion that one will get a lot more from this book if you think upon this book as a philosophy  Enjoy   This book was very motivational  I really enjoyed all the tips and suggestions  and found them useful to influence others and gain friendships  Great overall content  On the one hand  it dismays me that anyone ever needed to write a book on such basic principles of being a polite  friendly human being  On the other hand  it s not like we all actually manage to put these into practice the way we should  The title always sounded slightly manipulative to me  but on actually reading it  I think it s clear he means everything to be done sincerely  It s about becoming the sort of person who does these things naturally  not about using techniques to control people  happy to have read and marked up this book  it s one I hope to return to again and again Full of good advice  easy to understand but sometimes feels a little long  Has a real  good ol  boy  kind of a feel to it due to the era in which it was written   c 1936   but it s a must read  honestly  for interpersonal success if you re not an absolute natural when it comes to people skills  Allow me to save you some time  however  if this one isn t on your short list   Fundamental Techniques in Handling People  Don t criticize  condemn or complain  Give honest and sincere appreciation  Arouse in the other person an eager want Six ways to make people like you  Become genuinely interested in other people  Smile  Remember that a person s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language  Be a good listener  Encourage others to talk about themselves  Talk in terms of the other person s interests  Make the other person feel important   and do it sincerely Win people to your way of thinking  The

Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment A leader s job often includes changing your people s attitudes and behavior  Some suggestions to accomplish this  Begin with praise and honest appreciation  Call attention to people s mistakes indirectly  Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person  Ask questions instead of giving direct orders  Let the other person save face  Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement  Be  hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise   Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to  Use encouragement  Make the fault seem easy to correct  Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest   via Ned Hardy A great read  This provides much support on how to be a leader and how to guide people into your way of thinking without being forceful  This is a great book for figuring out what the other person wants and how to create win win situations  I will be reading it again in a month or so to see what I missed  It s decent  Anything you d really want to know about this book is pretty much right in the title  How to Win Friends and Influence People is informative and entertaining  and just as useful today as it was when it was first published in 1937  This is the case because Dale Carnegie had an understanding of human nature that will never be outdated  Carnegie explains that you can make a friend out of just about anyone and get them to do what you want them to  without arousing resentment  by seeing the situation from that person s point of view  He suggests that you can do this in a number of ways such as by appealing to the other person s highest ideals  remembering their name  letting them do most of the talking and speaking in terms of their interests  For instance   let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers   and  talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person   Carnegie illustrates his points with anecdotes of historical figures  leaders of the business world  and everyday folks  Financial success  Carnegie explains is due 15 percent to professional knowledge and 85 percent to  the ability to express ideas  to assume leadership  and to arouse enthusiasm among people   He teaches these skills through underlying principles of dealing with people so that they feel important and appreciated  If there is one thing you learn from the book  it is the ability to understand the different views of other people in different situations  He begins the book with the foundations of developing this skill of understanding others  He extends three principles that if applied will help you identify what other people want and how you can satisfy them  After that he introduces six ways to make people like you  These methods hover around the same three principles mentioned in the beginning of the book  After that the author discusses in two parts methods and principles that help you influence people to your way of thinking  The advice in the book is largely sound  but it s important to remember that the book was initially intended as a companion book to his classes on how to be a good salesman  In other words  these techniques work very well in relationships that are not expected to be long lasting so may not be ideal for all your close personal relationships  Similarly these techniques won t work on all people as there are some people with whom it is impossible to get along   I have read a few of these  help informative  books and this classic by Dale Carnegie has been the best one in my eyes  He uses multiple examples of everything including not only work place examples but everyday at home ones so all types of readers can really relate   While simple  it is amazing to see the improvements you can make in your own life after reading   It was several years ago  but this was a foundational book to my business understanding  Great book  Great book  One of those books everyone should read  A very good introduction to people skills which are very underrated in business or even life in general  You need to be able to work with other people in a manner that s mutually beneficial   I was impressed  And though I find myself perfectly likable  this book has shown me otherwise  No joke  I ve been doing it wrong   A 75 year old book that made me understand things I wouldn t have understood in 75 years  you eant to succeed in business  This book gives you hints on how to make social contacts and improve your speaking skills  My favorite character is Carnegiewho was a big believer in unity  in being free from all the racism when it came to dealing with other people The book has six major sections  The core principles of each section are outlined below Fundamental Techniques in Handling People  Don t criticize  or complain  Give honest and appreciation  This book goves you Six Ways to Make People Like Smile  Be a good listener Twelve Ways to Win People to Your Way of Thinking  Avoid arguments  Show respect for the other person s opinions  If you re wrong  admit it quickly and emphatically  etc  etc Be a Leader   How to Change People Without offending people  Begin with honest appreciation  Talk about your own mistakes firsts before attacking the otherI really recommend this book if you want to succeed in the business world guys  A well written book  Enjoyed reading it    Tl t bjml  wHd  mn lktb dh  d  lkhryn ytHdthwn  n nfshm  w bm ny rGy  jdw bHb tklm  n nfsy ktyr  D f lw qryth klh  lshn lnSyH  dy ybqy dh mksb This book not only instructs you how to do business and get the results you want  but also focuses on the costumer  employees  it tells you how to please everyone all around  It has it s own set of values that you must put in practice and constantly uphold  These values not only help you feel good about yourself  they are also very effective in dealing with people  Classic Carnegie    his message seems to be a thread that ties all his books together  When it s a good message   I guess that s okay  Repetition is the best way to remember   Good book  great examples So many in fact  that you need to review the book  or take notes to remember all his important points  Very Important book   I suggest it for all my friends who are interested in this topic    Great book just when I was about to think the other way when it came to my belief of managing people this book gave my confidence in trying my old ways again with more aid and knowledge   I have actually used some of this advice on how to deal with people and I do think it s worked most of the time  It was written a while ago and I normally wouldn t read a book like this  but I do consider myself better off for having read it  As good today as it was when it was written  At the beginning it was fun to discover my lack of social skills on a book that was written decades ago  but soon it became less relevant to my daily life and eventually I lost the interest to continue it  It s like listening to your parents giving life lessons that are inherently really important  and you know it  yet after a while you become immune to hearing them  I think  as the author originally recommended  it s best to skim through the book once just to know what is covered in each chapter  and then on occasions go back to it and learn a lesson or two that s applicable to your life   What makes this book so great aren t the rules or lists he writes  it s the fun anecdotes  He namechecks nearly everyone from the early 20th century  and he gives some great stories about TR that not only illustrate his point but are frankly just fun to read  Any history major  current or former  would love this title  I m surprised it s not required reading in upper division courses  Ha HA  Now I will be able to control your minds and force you all to be my friends First published in 1936  this is a great book about how to be a nice  thoughtful person  I just love the examples in the book of businessmen sitting down together to work out their problems  I wonder how Dale Carnegie would advise one to handle unhelpful customer support over the phone  That wasn t really a problem in 1936  but I bet he would have some good ideas about it  He gets you to think about interactions from the other person s point of view and how to influence behavior by being positive and appealing to people s nobler sides  Thumbs up  I read this as a teenager  recommended by my mom  She always loved this book and quoted from it often  It is more of a self esteem book of empowerment  Not bad   Offers fundamental things to do so that you come across more approachable and likable  Books from Leil Lowndes often challenges what is taught in this book by saying times has changed and techniques taught here are outdated  but I feel what is taught here are quite timeless it s a fantastic book for those who want to improve their communication skills  and the rules can be applied anytime  anywhere Learn to fake relationship       dodge people  etc There are many important lessons in Dale Carnegie s How to Win Friends and Influence People  but one major message on handling difficult situations or people is to not criticize  condemn  or complain  Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself  In a study done by the world famous psychologist B F  Skinner  it was proven that an animal  rewarded for good behavior  would learn much more rapidly and effectively than an animal being  punished for bad behavior   6   This shows that criticism only hinders the problem  whereas  appreciation for good behavior will solve the problem and others as well  The person being corrected or condemned will only retaliate with criticism and condemnation and try to justify him or herself instead of focusing on what actually needs correction  A simile that stuck out that applies to this claim is  criticisms are like homing pigeons  they always return home   meaning that giving criticisms only end in receiving criticisms  so it is important to  breed sympathy  tolerance  and kindness   8 18   Through psychological experiments and personal experiences  it is inferable that criticisms and condemnations only seem to cause backtracking from the original intention  I am not a big fan of self help books  But I found this one interesting  It is not amoral and didactic  like 48 Rules of Power   It suggests practical common sense ways on how to deal with people with integrity and honesty  yet get along with them well to ensure that your work gets done  It s one of those books that are  bestsellers  AND contain useful information too  P S    It s less of  How to win Friends  and more of  How to Influence People   No book can teach you how to win friends  You simply can t  win  friends  3 5 5 The amazing ideas of you can make your charisma to be felt by others  Would have been 5 stars but for the fact that the methods therein are probably less applicable to today s generations  Be like Abe Lincoln and don t critisize  I don t agree w  all the authors points but this is a provocative read that every person should try on for size  Originally read this book my freshmen year of college and read it as a refresher   still a great read  The information is still applicable in the 21st century   CRnegie s classic is one of my favourites  This third time through the book was also my most enjoyable  I have found it more challenging to put many of these principles into practice  but also a greater sense of accomplishment when doing so  Maybe I ve become more honest with myself  I pledge to read this book and follow its principles at least every other year  I find his stories and anecdotes entertaining and helpful in illustrating his points  and his knowledge of a great many historical figures is worth the price of admission itself  Met plezier gelezen  Eigenlijk meer omwille van de wat verouderde inzichten en onverholen sexisme  bv de pagina s rond de regels voor een goed huwelijk zijn hilarisch in dat opzicht   Maar een stel inzichten werkt natuurlijk nog altijd erg goed  Vaak getest in werkomgevingen en zeer plezierig om te gebruiken  rwwwwwwww hktb jmyl w mfyd jd w f l stfdt mnh  I have mixed thoughts about this book  I guess  Most of the techniques are blindingly obvious  common sense things that people don t need to read this book to know  How do you make friends  Constantly praise people and always be interested in what they are saying   There is a whole chapter on each A few of the others are cheap salesman tricks that everyone already uses  How do you make your customers feel important  Talk about their desires and constantly call people by name   A  sales pitch  usually means a lengthy explanation of why people will benefit from buying the product  and salesmen are always calling customers by their names  The first technique is so overused that it is expected  and as soon as the sales pitch begins  the customer begins the task of poking holes in your presentation  The second technique is just downright creepy  When people ask my name at a coffee shop or a fast food restaurant  I m always tempted to say   None of your business  I m just a guy standing in line to buy something  don t pretend I mean more than that    A few of his ideas are both cheap salesman tricks AND blindingly obvious common sense suggestions   Smile   So part of me wants to say that this book doesn t have any original ideas A couple of problems with saying that  though  This book was written in 1936 and has had enormous influence on the business world  His techniques may seem like  cheap salesman tricks  at this point because salespeople all over the world have employed them  finding them incredibly successful  Salesmen use  cheap tricks  because they work  Also  Dale Carnegie never says that his ideas are new or original  The bulk of each chapter consists of multiple examples of how successful people have been using the described technique since time began  These success stories concern world leaders such as Lincoln  Teddy Roosevelt  And Winston Churchill  They also involve high profile business leaders such as Andrew Carnegie  Rockefeller  Charles Schwab  and others  famous people from Charles Dickens to Ben Franklin to Queen Victoria  and a wide variety or ordinary  common folks  stories   Most of this last category are student of Carnegie courses  and it s hardly surprises that their teacher would have great things to say about their success  Particularly when that same teacher is advising the principle   Be lavish in your appreciation and hearty in your praise     Carnegie is not so much inventing new ideas as combining ideas that work into a volume  and he tells you that  Such a tactic today would be a cheap salesman trick  his book was the first of it s kind  It definitely started something  but is it a good thing I have no answer to that now  First  I read a library copy of the book  This meant I was forbidden to do what the book suggests  highlight key passages  write notes in the margins  and fill the back pages with your own remarks  I found several places where I would have liked to do that  This review is a  first read  and this book is not meant to be read only once  The treatment Dale Carnegie recommends seems a little creepy  that you review your notes and the chapters on a regular basis  that you constantly dwell on your experience with the techniques  that you always consider how to live better through them  Seems kind of like the devout Christian s relationship to scripture  I wonder what the reaction in the religious community was back in 1936  or if the if the  nine suggestions to get the most out of this book  were added later  More importantly  the test of this book is really applying its lessons to the world of business  an experiment I ll be seeing in action soon  So I give this book a tentative 4 star rating for now  for shear power and influence  How to Win Friends and Influence People indeed  This book has succeeded in both  It has a huge fan base  and has been widely followed  The fans are the friends the book has won  and the following is the influence it has had on people  Remarkable After the upcoming test  I may change my rating and give an explanation  This review may have to be modified   I read this book during the Taliban regime  1999  when the TV  Radio and everything was banned  I rented the Persian version of this book from our local shopkeeper  The title was translated  How to make friends   It was an interesting book for a 15 years me I recommend this book for people to learn how to interact with people and approach them  It is a good book overall   This is definitely the kind of book that you need to read several times in order to fully reap its benefits  The message of the book is timeless although it was written nearly 80 years ago  He stresses the importance of sincerity and honesty as opposed to flattery which I think really sets this book apart  Some of the anecdotes used as examples were a bit dated and boring  which was to be expected  Overall  this book is a classic that everyone should read in order to better learn how to effectively deal with people   interesting  I read this book from a Vietnamese version after hearing people mention and recommend it for years  It is a great book with all valuable advices and lessons  true  Only appearing in my thoughts while reading it  those stories may be changed in some ways to fit into new society  Of course  the core messages will remain with their full meanings but their application should be taken with the consideration of current changing world and life  It is just simply like prior to being a good person to help and care for others  that person should take good care of him herself Anyway  it would be an excellent book to read not only once in a lifetime but as many as you wish and whenever you want to find an inner peace and calm  Great book about common social practices  Despite of the title induces a thinking of self help book  this book is precursor of the negotiation book Getting the Yes and lots of techniques of leadership All lessons of the book are focused on how to deal with people  even in unpleasant situations  The influence lessons are always directed in how I should treat people  The author give feasible lessons how to be truly empathetic with other person s situation and how to motivate always  The book often repeats the lessons over and over the chapters and contains lots of cases about the people who did Carnigie s course  Some of them make the lesson clear others are just to sell his course I strong recommend this book for new leaders and who frequently deals with people and teams  Say things In terms of what s important to your audience  Get them saying yes before you make the ask  Take a genuine interest in others  People like to talk about themselves  They really don t care about you or what you want to say  Just a few of the lessons learned from this book  Lots of good examples to clarify each principal  insightful book  This is one of my favorite books in the self help genre I ve read for a while  I know of other books that I ve read that suggest Carnegie s approach is too simplistic  but I am with him all the way  Loved it  Classic self help book  It has genuine tips  unlike most modern self help books  In summary Fundamental techniques in handling people 1  Don t criticize  condemn or complain  2  Give honest and sincere appreciation  3  Arouse in the other person an eager wantSix ways to make people like you 1  Become genuinely interested in other people  2  Smile 3  Remember that a person s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language  4  Be a good listener  Encourage others to talk about themselves  5  Talk in terms of the other person s interests  6  Make the other person feel important   and do it sincerely Win people to your way of thinking 1  The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it  2  Show respect for the other person s opinions  Never say   You re wrong   3  If you are wrong  admit it quickly and emphatically  4  Begin in a friendly way  5  Get the other person saying  yes  yes  immediately  6  Let the other person do a great deal of the talking  7  Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers  8  Try honestly to see things from the other person s point of view  9  Be sympathetic with the other person s ideas and desires  10  Appeal to the nobler motives  11  Dramatize your ideas  12  Throw down a challenge Be a leader 1  Begin with praise and honest appreciation  2  Call attention to people s mistakes indirectly  3  Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person  4  Ask questions instead of giving direct orders  5  Let the other person save face  6  Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement  7  Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to  8  Use encouragement  Make the fault seem easy to correct  9  Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest  I read this book when I was in high school  and like so many people  it had a huge influence on my life  The two main things I learned from it were to take the time to look at any situation from the perspective of the other person  and that it is possible to get people to follow your lead while still acting morally and ethically  Although virtually everything else in the world may be spinning out of control  human nature does not and has not changed  Manifestations may change  but human nature itself stays the same  For that reason  I can still recommend this book as a tool for becoming better acquainted with the psychological predilections within oneself and others  This is an interesting read  that supports a very positve philosophy in dealing with people  and gives numerous success stories  There is no doubt however  that the book is dated in a less cynical time  The weight of the examples also apply more towards a person struggling to maintain a leadership position rather than obtain a position of influence  All in all  I do recommend this book  at the very least  it is uplifting  easy to read  and will make its reader more willing to empathize with other people  Even though the book is dated the concepts of human emotions would never change  Dale Carnegie highlights the principles that are required to get along with people  He very clearly mentions that all the principles in the book will work only if its followed with sincerity and genuinity  Thanks Natalie for recommending it  its indeed a good read  A classic read about how to spread your ideas without turning people off  hnangsuue elmniiepnhnangsuue thiidangmaakchwngsaamsibthuenghaasibpiik n ekhyaidyinchuue hnangsuue

as well  really good advice  now if I could apply it every day  P  Although it s been ten years since I ve read this book  I still remember how much it influenced me and helped me break out of my shy little shell  This book helps people to attain social confidence  not through tricks or smarminess  but through things that actually just make you a nicer person to be around and make others more comfortable A must read for everyone  but especially anyone who wants or needs to do work involving people or self promotion I remember as a teenager making fun of my sister s friend  a DJ  for having this book  He just smiled and said   You should read it   That really shut me up and made me think about how much more popular he was than me  and a few years later  I saw the book  remembered that day  and read it Sometimes I think I really need to read this every year  A well written book  Enjoyed reading it    Interessante abordagem sobre o trato com as pessoas  apesar dos exemplos um tanto fora da realidade brasileira do seculo XXI  U livro que ensina a pensar um pouco mais no outro  pensar pelo lado do outro para conseguir o que quer de maneira menos agressiva  A very good book  truly a classic that everyone  and not only business people or salesman   should read at least once Carnegie is convinced success depends more on interpersonal relationships than on academic technical knowledge and  therefore  outlines here some principles regarding how to make  lead and manage such relationships  It is NOT about flattery  selfishness or manipulative hypocrisy  far from that  it s about empathy and consideration for each others  That sounds cheesy but  honestly  how many of us really apply or know how to apply such an approach in our dealing with others  Then here you are  this book contains tips for everyone   If ever there were a book I didn t especially want people seeing on my nightstand  here it be  It just feels like it begs for an explanation  am I right  Anyway  I picked up a pretty beat up 1980 something version  half expecting to laugh my way through the first chapter and then shelf it  but I quickly found my self oddly engrossed  How little I d known of the very basics of carrying on  The common sense in this little gem is kind of amazing  and Carnegie is darn likeable  I mean really  if you want people to do nice things for you even when you can offer nothing in return  behave more like a dog and be extra happy to see them and super interested in them  I mean I m majorly paraphrasing here  but lovingly so  If it were any more simple  I d think I were missing something  If you let it  this stuff can actually help you succeed  If that last thing I said about the dog makes it sound like a manual for selling yourself  rest assured that Carnegie stresses sincerity as much as skill  If you think your twenty something college professor has more valuable things to tell you than your grandmother  and if you ve really nothing to learn from anyone anyway  don t read this book  not that you d dream of it  of course  But I certainly recommend it to those not drowning in haughty pretense and looking to actually learn something  and particularly to the socially clueless like myself  Happy reading  Readable book when you have spare time    Useful read  Finished reading this back in December  and I still think about it  A better title may be  How to keep the friends you have by being less of a d      While the concepts make sense  it s hard to override instincts and put the concepts into practicePros   Well presented and structured  Useful information  particularly the section on argumentsCons   A bit repetitive at times  Inconsistencies between the start of a chapter  and the conclusion  A lot of anecdotes tend to come across as lucky occurrences than deterministic outcomes from following the advice in the book Would I recommend this book to others    I already have  but with a grain of salt  This book is great at telling you what NOT to do  but not so great at telling you what to do instead  This is a hilarious page turner and though the title is a little quaint and corny  Dale Carnegie s enthusiasm is infectious and seems to capture well what must have been a very powerful speaking style   Very interesting stuff  I will definitely have to try it out  Apparently this book changed my brother s life so I had to read it  and then some old guys on a plane were like   Hey  she s reading Dale Carnegie   Some of the stuff is a bit dated  and I wish the material was better organized  but it s still great advice for just being a good person  I loved this book  What a novel idea to actually listen and care about people and stop being so selfish  And yes I totally agree 90  of a job is people skills  not technical  There are some people who really only care about themselves and they can and do use the techniques laid out in this book to manipulate people but they are fakes  cowards and truly unhappy people deep down  Side note   for a great read on the subject of selfish  manipulative and entitled people read Aaron James  book titled  Assholes    Some truths are timeless  This is a foundational book for all salesmen  negotiators  media people  politicians  and those who want to be a good friend to anyone  Even though originally published in 1953  it has bee reprinted dozens of times as recently as April 2006  Very practical information for all that will improve your relationships and change your life  Really  Not just a clever statement  A GREAT BOOK  A classic book with great tips and helpful reminders with interpersonal relationships  the key word is reminders  He is not trying to teach us common courtesy  he is teaching the importance of consistency Dale Carnegie s How to Win Friends and Influence People gives you different sets of principles for how to interact with people  create acquaintance and friendships  persuade someone to your opinion  and become a leader  As for how to interact with people  he advises people  1  not to criticize  condemn  or complain   2  to give honest and sincere appreciation  and  3  to arouse in other people an eager want  meaning something like convincing people of why they really should want to do what they claim to want to do or why they should do something that you  as someone persuading them  would like them to do  Regarding the other areas the book is about  you can read the list of principles here on the Wikipedia page Although the book was helpful in terms of its advice  it did offer a lot more principles than most people  myself included  could memorize  And the title  unfortunately  suggests manipulation even though that is not really the point of the book at all  for example  it would be hard to argue that the book is trying to manipulate people when one of its principles for making acquaintances and friends is become genuinely interested in other people  Despite these areas  though  the many principles and the titles  the folksy stories and verbal illustrations of the principles made the book fun  By the way  to be perfectly honest  I listened to this in audiobook  and if you can get it in that format  and listen to it in your spare time  I d recommend it  because of the warm voice of the narrator  A good read and looking forward to read his other book collections  ktb mhm tqr byfrq jd f  tnmy  l lqt m  lns khSwS lw Hd byshtGl f  lbyzns w l lqt l m  Very applicable book and many will find it as a life changing experience  Simple and easy principles that can be applied by anyone  Some may feel it is like trickery but that is not the message the author is conveying  It is enjoyable too  given that it takes real life examples that happened  The principles are listed after each part to help readers revisit them every now and then  Overall it is worth having a copy of this book    Although this book was first published in 1936  all of the concepts can still be used today  However  it is quite amusing to read the stories and examples which could never happen in today s pc world  Story telling common sense but eye opener     Has plenty of advice   Decent overall except some of the parts Great book  Dale Carnegie really does a good job explaining the art of influencing people and dealing with them  It has valuable principles that apply from everyday life to history changing events  The only reason I did not give it a perfect score was because as I read through the book  the last few chapters were repetitive  They were about the same things and contained the same principals just worded differently  All in all though  How To Win Friends And Influence People is a book that everyone that wants to improve in the art of human relations should read  Timeless  useful tips  but slightly repetitive The way Dale expressed the principles with real time scenarios is impressive  I don t usually like business books but this one was brief and to the point  I ve heard a lot of people recommend this over the years and I finally decided to check it out  All the advice is practical  the key is remembering to apply it in your day to day interactions  A lot of the examples are a little dated  but I think that s what gives it its charm    if they were modern examples I think it d be less interesting   Some of the examples how to talk to people are a bit naive and might even be counterproductive  Nonetheless  most of advice given in this book are still relevant to this date and can largely improve both your personal and business relationships  Everything Dale Carnegie says in this book is common sense  but it is a REALLY good reminder of how to treat people and get what you want out of business or personal transactions while still maintaining good relationships with people  I will keep this on hand and listen to it again in a year or so when I need to remind myself of the points he makes  Basically it boils down to always put yourself in the other person s shoes  be positive not angry or irate with people  and treat others with respect  The principles are so good  that I am going to copy paste the outline here so I have them saved Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1  Don t criticize 2  Give honest and sincere appreciation 3  Arouse in the other person an eager want  Six ways to make people like you1  Become genuinely interested in other people 2  Smile 3  Remember a person s name 4  Be a good listener  Encourage others to talk about themselves 5  Talk in terms of the other person s interests 6  Make the other person feel important   and do it sincerely  Win people to your way of thinking1  The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it 2  Show respect for the other person s opinions  Never say   You re wrong  3  If you are wrong  admit it quickly and emphatically 4  Begin in a friendly way 5  Get the other person saying  yes  yes  immediately 6  Let the other person do a great deal of the talking 7  Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers 8  Try honestly to see things from the other person s point of view 9  Be sympathetic with the other person s ideas and desires 10  Appeal to the nobler motives 11  Dramatize your ideas 12  Throw down a challenge  Be a Leader1  Begin with praise and honest appreciation 2  Call attention to people s mistakes indirectly 3  Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person 4  Ask questions instead of giving direct orders 5  Let the other person save face 6  Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement 7  Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to 8  Use encouragement  Make the fault seem easy to correct 9  Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest  Great book on how to be a good person not a good sales book at all in my opinion  Excellent guide on how to talk to people  This is not a book that can be read only once  you have to read it a couple of times while making sure that you apply its concepts  Works like charm Use it as a reference  My only concern with this book is that some of its ideas can come across as manipulative and Machiavellian  The title itself is sort of misleading  since i thought this was some sort of book for making friends or something  However after i started reading i knew how wrong i was  This book is somewhat revolving around the idea of how getting on someones goodside can bring you benefits  as well as simple steps to accomplish it  In a political perspective  this is a book every salesmen should read as it would be very helpful to them selling stuff or getting contracts signed etc  It s not a book about how to get friends  money  and influence in everyday life but a book about how to do those things when your on the job  I recommend reading this before you start a job of anything related to politics  Never to soon to read this book again      Now I know where 90  of my professors and HR people got their info  Great book  Amazing quotes   one of its kind book in a very interesting way  I tend to think this is one of those books which all kids should read when they are teenagers  Although  if you re older  it s still definitely worth the time     Well it realy helps you to realize that to make friends and influence people you just need to not do what you would do normally  and redirect that energy to a more positive line of thought  so that you can do better for others   I listened to the audio book  The version I have is like a 7 hour book from iTunes  I used to listen to it while I was walking around London  I m not sure if the content of my audio book is exactly the same as this print book but I ll review it here anyway I didn t think that I would learn anything from this book that I didn t already know  I thought it would just be common sense  What I was shocked to learn is that bad people don t know that they are bad people  Bad people actually think they are good people  Even murderers think they are good people and will defend and justify their actions  That really shocked me  It was hard to believe at first but now it makes sense and helps me understand people better Reading this book has helped me get along with people that I wouldn t normally like or have anything in common with  I used to just avoid people like that and not talk to them  But now I can have pleasant conversations with people who I have little to nothing in common with  I recently talked for hours to someone I have nothing in common with at all  We are very opposite and he is the type of person who is extremely opinionated  states his opinions as facts  and thinks everyone who doesn t think like he does is an idiot  Normally I would avoid someone like this or end up in an argument  By using what I learned in this book I had a pleasant conversation with this guy I m much better off for having read this book and I would recommend it to anyone  It s nearly impossible to avoid people that you don t like or have anything in common with so this is important stuff to learn  I just found proof that i did or rather it was a course requirement to do a book review on this book for my Managerial Finance class  Here is the zest of it all  The main element that the book constantly hints upon is trying to change the focus from  me  to  you   I hope it is working out for other readers  honestly that advise has not always worked out for me  But the book is an easy read with an in depth explored topic  Great for learning how to better listen to people and has tons of tips for being a better person  Also touches on leadership  Excellent  and practical  though with rather dated examples  Classic that every salesperson  dad  mom  manager and CEO should read and probably already has read  It give a new point of view when we re looking to another people This is a very insightful and useful book  It offers valuable guidance about how to deal more successfully with other people  even when they are initially reticent or even hostile  and it cites many examples  both from the author s own experience and from history  of the successful application of the principles it espouses Among them are  Become genuinely interested in other people  rather than just in yourself   Smile    Be a good listener     and so on  In general  Carnegie advocates kindness  generosity of spirit  tolerance and understanding  not only as good in themselves but also as advantageous to the person exhibiting these traits He has no illusions about human nature  He views people as La Rochefoucauld did  as being motivated chiefly by  amour propre   And yet  far from causing Carnegie to disdain his fellow man for pettiness or narrow selfishness  this insight makes him more understanding   How can we expect people to be different from how they are and must be    he might ask But the book has imperfections  Carnegie is quite selective in his use of historical examples  and sometimes badly misrepresents the cases he cites  in his zeal to show historical support for his own methods  For one example  he takes Abraham Lincoln as a model of persuasive power  not mentioning that Lincoln  whatever his oratorical prowess  was unable to persuade Southerners that he was anything other than their bitter foe  intent on undermining their way of life  so that his election prompted a very bloody civil war and  eventually  his own assassination  Certainly Lincoln was an heroic figure who deserves enormous praise for his management of the war and for ending slavery  but he is probably not the best example of the persuasive power of Carnegie style bonhomie And Carnegie points to Socrates  too  as a model of his methods  heartily approving of the persuasive power of Socratic dialectic  Yet Carnegie fails to see the irony in this  given that Socrates  methods aroused such bitter hatred in many of his fellow Athenians that they tried him and executed him  Again  Socrates is one of the greatest figures in Western history  and a model of virtue  but is hardly a model to follow if one wishes simply to  win friends  These quibbles aside  however  this book is well worth reading  and is vastly better than the typical self help book  No less a figure than Warren Buffett has used Carnegie s methods to great success  Buffett is most famous for investing prowess  but equally important to his success has been his ability to manage people  to keep talented people who are already so wealthy that they do not need to work at all  working hard for his company  He does so by following Carnegie s advice  to be lavish with praise and sparing with criticism  thereby arousing in his employees a zeal for their work I would give this book 4 5 stars if I could  Oh what a fun read  I approached this rather skeptically  but the book took common sense wisdom and cast it in a behavioural economics structure that had me nodding from page one to the end  And it was an easy read as well  An incredible book  All managers  supervisors  leaders  employees and employers should read this I believe the world will become a better place if we all followed  not all  but just a few of the principles mentioned in this book  I didn t agree with every principle that Carnegie expressed  but on the whole  it was a very intriguing  insightful read that I enjoyed  I think that for the most part this book would be helpful for just about anybody   Classic must read Be lavish in your praise  and hearty in your approbation  Let the other person save face  You can t win an argument  This book  which is now more than seventy five years old  has persisted because of its core ideas on how to understand other people in today s society  While some of the writing hasn t aged well due to shifts in socioeconomic situations  the majority of the ideas in this book can be applied rather well to our daily lives This book can serve several purposes depending on your current situation  For some professionals  like used car salespeople or marketers  this book may read as a manual for how to exploit or move the masses to your point of view  For others  this book may act as a cautionary guide on how to avoid the first group s tactics  And for others still  this book describes honest ways to bolster efficiency at the workplace  at home  and with friends  The key idea I received from this book  no matter how you interact with others  always be genuine  False praise and insincerity are easy to spot  even in an age where so many relationships are abstracted by a digital layer  provides insightful recommendation you can implement almost instantly  Great suggestions  A lot of the examples were a bit cheesy  and this guy sure loved teddy Roosevelt  But still  many of these concepts can be applied to many of us  nearly 100 years later   The most important word in any language is the person s name that you are talking to  I should have read this book years before  I have reread this book more than 4 times and I must say that this book had made me rethink most of my situation in different perspective  This changes your personal behavior Absolute must read for all that seek to make positive and lasting friendships relationships  Cool  I actually haven t finished it and don t know if I will  I ve been listening to it at work  so I can t say how far I ve gotten  but so far  it s nothing I haven t heard before  put yourself in his shoes  don t criticize  smile  and focus on the other person instead of yourself  These are all great and timeless principles as the other reviews have said  and the book isn t boring  so I gave it a three  I just don t know if I need to finish the book if I ve already gotten the gist of it   A Very impressive reading on human relationship  ktb jmyl w mbsT w sls jdan fy lqr  Took close to a year  but I finally finished this  Now  I m ready to smile at you  listen  and become friends    And then manipulate you into doing whatever I desire    This is one of the most popular books on the subject of  How to be influential and stuff  Dale s take home message of the book is that you need to listen more  considerably more  than you talk  and that you must feel what the other person feels and act accordingly  after all we are guided by emotions  kind of He also mentions a lot of stories that will make you remember each subject Like every other self improvement book  it does not cover every aspect of the subject  and you certainly need to read more books on the topic  if you re interested that is  intressting useful everyday life tips  Excellent for individual as well as business relationships  Being such a classic book  I figured I had to read this  It was worth it and everyone should probably read it  I think the hidden gem in this book is that there is advice from many famous people in it   either people the author knew directly or those he studied heavily   presidents and other political leaders  millionaires  from the late 1800s and early 1900s  so very successful people   etc  All the concepts are super simple and there are lots of examples of successes implementing the lessons on the book  Sometimes  the examples seems to attribute the success too much to the single tip in that chapter  when I m sure there are many other factors at play  Especially whenever there was an example of a tip around parent child issues i e  getting a kid to eat his veggies was as simple as convincing him that he could  wallop the daylights out of the bigger kid  bully  someday if he would only eat the things his mother wanted him to eat  Concepts have been shared in numerous  unrelated  books and training courses over the last  80 years  as they are mostly just basic interpersonal awareness concepts  But  it s presented so simply and completely  this book is a good read for anyone  regardless of their strength in dealing with people  It still gave me some new ideas  and was a good reminder about some things I easily forget  like pointing out all the good behaviors and progress in my kids  instead of criticizing their misbehavior   Overall  an easy and worthwhile read  If I had a paper version instead of the Kindle copy  I m sure it would have been dog eared and highlighted throughout  I expect  hope  to look at my highlighted notes regularly  to remind me of the lessons in this book   This had some great ideas  I only wish I would have read it earlier in my life  Highly recommend to anyone wanting a refresher course in their people skills  I took this on almost as a class  and took notes for future reference  Lots of solid wisdom in human relations here  This book does not deliver ground breaking insight about man     use here is gender neutral  and society  The book talks about things we already know subconsciously  the beauty of the book however is on how it articulated this seemingly abstract values  its good Very good  Learned a ton about human nature  Very helpful   Rereading this in 2004 made me realize how much it taught me years ago  The lessons were worth reviewing  although the content  while consistent ly interesting  was not that well written  Audiobook too  Great introespection on human values and desires  from a viewpoint of a successful entrepeneur  Maybe a little too pink  but it might be because i am way to cynical in life  The content was fine and I have to give it 4 stars because I agree with all the content and think it s a valuable book  However  How to Win Friends didn t tell me much that I didn t know already  The book has a number of good pointers that I had never consciously thought about  so I do appreciate that they were captured in a way that helped me think about them I find value in the book not necessarily for myself  but for the fact that it was written and other people have the opportunity to read it  I can think of a few people who would benefit from reading this book The biggest draw back  The writing style  And the fact that this book is a platform for Dale to drop names and make everyone feel inferior to the great men that he speaks about throughout the book  Many useful tips regarding dealing with people   making them like you and being a leader  Mostly demonstrated on various stories from regular or famous people  like Napoleon   Easy to read  Key principles for social dynamics So  this book was written in the 30s  and is still highly recommended by top performers and influencers in the business arena  Why  Well  after giving it a chance I realized that pretty much of the principles presented in the book are the sum of psychology hacks that are timeless   Don t be fooled by the old stories and examples about letters written by Lincoln or Roosevelt  Human behavior and social dynamics is the name of the game in most of the things we tackle  in business and in life  and after being in the corporate world for more than 10 years and as a sales person  you learn a thing or two  I wish I had read this book earlier  So  get in it  finish it and you won t regret it  Great buy  Practical and influential in it s own right  this classic best seller remains one of the top books for understanding the realm of influence  relationship and success  I have come against a Christian response to this book and it s measure of success  being fueled by personal and the world s measuring stick instead of God s   but the truth is I see I lot of overlap and a lot of great principles that can help anyone  Christian or not  True  to get the most out of this book we must be willing to see read it as a commentary on what is largely self driven and within our own realm of control and influence  But the question of what we desire to influence those around us with is where the conversation goes further  This is simply a book that helps to expose exactly what sits at the inner core of all human emotion and motivation  and how to tailor that for your own purpose The book deals with the questions of how to make people like you  how to win people over to your way of thinking and how to influence without the anger and resentment that can follow reaction to ambitious leadership  On the surface perhaps these ideas might come across as a bit offensive and off putting to some  After all  understanding that we all are bred to manipulate in some form or fashion opens up the realization that we have also been manipulated by others to their point of view  But underneath this book simply exposes an uncomfortable reality and challenges the notion that manipulation and influence needs to be negative  And once we are able to come face to face with that  we then are able to ask where we want to sit ourselves and what we want to do with those personal ideas that are burning a hole in side of ourselves  It puts everyone on the same playing field and simply separates based on those who choose to be influenced or those who chose to influence  and then looks at the guiding principles that make up those who can influence well  We all have the choice of what we want to do with this truth and realization  and this book is a helpful tool for navigating that tricky ground of winning people and influencing them effectively   wl ktb qryth f  Hyt   l  nSHn  bqryth wHd SHb   zyz  ly w  y tbr bmthb  kh kbyr ly  Hmd_ mr bjd lktb dh  thr fy wHwln  360 drj   n m knttnmy  bshry  Hlw  jd jdwslwb lktb  rw

work on one principle at a time  The book is fairly dated  so it has some old examples    which isn t bad  but it used names of people and companies that are not very familiar  The principles were great  the examples could ve used some work to make it a better read  Worthy for your time and lots of learning in very small book  While this book had some good advice  it clearly influenced too many other writers  Essentially everything here was something I ve read in other advice books  I realize the others were reiterating Carnegie s points  I read the 80s revised edition  which had updated examples  They were pretty jarring  The book was written in the 30s  so was full of historically interesting anecdotes  Every now and again there was an anecdote from the 70s  and each one was out of place  Getting an original edition would be better  Easy to read with lots of practical  real life  examples of application  Old fashioned  but good advice on how to get along better with people   This is the best ever book I read about relationship and dealing with people  The author  Dale Carnegie explains the areas an things that we need concentrate to influence people and to have a deep relationship with people around  It was short and sweet  Dale lists out the things to be done to influence people with an example each  One simple way to make friends that stick in my mind as I was going through this book is to show that you are interested in people to make to make them your friend It s not to fear anyone but it s very important that everyone should know    It s the individual who is not interested in his fellowman  who has the greatest difficulties in his life and provides the greatest injuries to others  By reputation it was the epitome of uncool  so I groaned inwardly when as part of my journalism degree work this was an assigned text for a class on psychology and communication  There are many helpful principles here  many of them practiced less and less as the years go on  to the detriment of our social fabric  A lot of what is written today takes its cues from this book   Excellent book for improving your social abilities  Was excellent book  How to Win Friends and Influence People is full of practical advice that appears obvious and self explanatory on the surface  However  so few people actually obey all of its guidelines that it is a valuable book for anyone seeking to improve themselves  From practical ways to avoid criticism to getting the best of any argument  Carnegie touches on how to navigate a wide spectrum of human interactions  One of the best things about this book is that every chapter has a wealth of anecdotes and stories instead of just instructional text  very good  ideas wise  This book was actually pretty darn good  That s saying something for me  as I tend to get annoyed with self help books  Mr  Carnegie is not presumptuous in the slightest  He lets the stories and experiences shared in this book speak for themselves  This aspect of his writing really connected with me  as I never felt him getting on his soap box  or anything of the sort  Several times  he makes comments like  Preposterous  Crazy  Well let s learn about the experience of such and such a person who used this very process      It was also quite an entertaining read   his writing style is one that one can keep you interested  which you can really appreciate in a self help book   I am usually falling asleep reading these types of books     Part of what made it so easy to read was that there really wasn t too much filler  which seems to plague books of this genre  That being said  there was SOME filler   and I think that a large portion of the end of the book could be condensed  He also seems to only provide suggestions on how to handle situations when the people involved are all generally good  He does acknowledge that these methods won t work for everyone  I can think of a few in my life   but doesn t provide alternate suggestions or methods on how to handle these  special  individuals  Perhaps this is approached in one of his other works Negative points aside  this was really the best self help book that I have read   light years more entertaining and helpful than others of the genre  If you are looking to read a self help book  this is probably the one of the few that you can finish without feeling like you wasted your time   It was goodish  It was a good reminder  and some new info  I felt like it was a little preachy  and a person who lived by all of these principles would start to feel fake to me  But it did make me focus on other people and thinking more about them than about myself  which I felt was the true benefit of the book   sometimes you just have to hear it to realize Despite its manipulative sounding title  this book is about genuinely improving your social skills and winning people to your way of thinking  Although I generally agree with his principles  I think Carnegie makes following them sound too easy Carnegie states that 15  of success is due to technical knowledge  and the other 85  is due to personality and leadership  He says that the  1 secret to success in dealing with people is having a sympathetic grasp of the other person s point of view  He talks a lot about respecting and understanding other people  and quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson   Every man I meet is my superior in some way  In that  I learn of him  Carnegie also talks a lot about praise  he says that praise is more effective than criticism for changing behavior and winning people over  so you should be  hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise  The book includes lessons from people like Jesus  Confucius  Buddha  Abraham Lincoln  Andrew Carnegie  Ben Franklin  John Rockefeller  Charles Schwab  and J P  Morgan  Carnegie provides anecdotes of his own experiences  and those of the people who took his courses I first read this book when co workers suggested I improve my social skills  because I received many recommendations for this book  I re read it because the lessons are so important and worthwhile Below are the book s principles  along with my notes Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1  Don t criticize  condemn  or complain   Criticism is futile 2  Give honest and sincere appreciation   Avoid flattery 3  Arouse in the other person an eager want   Salespeople need to show how

com 2010    This is a very good book about relationships and communication  I don t like the title  That is about the only bad thing about the book  Love to listen to it on tape  GREAT book  Seriously recommend highlighting the main points  and reviewing it over and over again  I ve already successfully applied some of the techniques  this is a great book for people who love to argue  who are struggling with their own pride  and for people who don t understand why they get along great with some people and not others  not everyone will agree with you  so don t fight it  gain perspective through books like this one    I read this book as a young man and it had a very positive impact on my life going forward    Interesting  however somehow it feels like cheating with no sincere emotions towards other people  How to Win Friends   Influence People  really influenced my mind telling about how to handle different people with his personal experiences The books starts with how to win friends  he tells a very simple principle how to win our friends   we can make more friends genuinely by having interest in other people within two months and it takes two years in getting other people s interest on you  and gain their attention by genuinely having interest  One of the example what he quoted is really excellent   How can we say we have love on our friends  it is whenever our friends talk to us we have to stop our work and then listen to what out friend conveys   He narrated this example with a situation between son and a mother  And by the end of the book he says few principles that every individual should follow to become a Leader  Leader   should always accept his mistakes and then should point out the others mistakes  He should not criticise any one for the mistakes but rather he should praise about the success things and then from those examples he should point to the mistake done by the member  Good examples  I am sure it was revolutionary at the time  Timeless classic  well worth the read  Good advice  should be revisited many times over  A great book full of applicable recommendations to speak more effectively and to hurt less feelings  Even though this book is kind of dated  I felt that the suggestions were timeless  I have actually implemented many of the suggestions in my everyday life already and found them quite useful  This is an awesome book  it s a guide   it gives the reader a very practical way to deal with people   it really helps   Some people already master these techniques  they have them by nature   but many many people lack them   human relationships are really simple and easy  we just have to be sweet  hearty and sincere   i really wish every1 could read this book   I Just wanna mention that some examples are somehow  boring  but i will always always keep this book with me and reread it   it s a fortune   Somewhat longer than needed  but an interesting read with important personal and career advices  Very good book  As a person who often has to write reports critiquing networks  this book gave me ideas on how to have those reports received better  At first it almost seems like this book is about  How to be a decent individual in order to manipulate others   However  with further progress you learn this isn t a collection of tactics to apply mechanically  but path to being a better person My only critique of this book is that many of the chapters are redundant  and thus seemed dull to read  You can only read  walk a mile in someone else s shoes  so many times All an all  a must read  currently rereading In college  I did a comparison of this book and The Prince by Machiavelli  I found The Prince more intelligent and more genuine Still Carnegie s ideas work  This is an important book to read with important lessons to live  ktb ry   ykhTb fy l nsn Tby th wystHthh llkhrwj Ht  yt ml m  Gyrh blTryq  lmftrD  wlmwfq  lfTrth   lkn nHtj lqrth  kthr mn mr  Ht  trskh  fkrh fy  qwln wttrjm l f l Hqyqy   For the most part  things you ve heard before  but it s a good refresher on working with other people  Probably should read this periodically   when you have an interview or want to get promoted  etc Stating the obvious but something we must be reminded of everyday  You don t read this just once  Must reread from time to time to refresh the mind of the techniques   I was always skeptical of this book because the title makes it sound pretty skeezy  In actuality  it s a well written book that I would especially recommend to anyone who works in management  It s written in a format along the lines of  Here s an idea  Here s 2 5 quick stories about how this has worked in real world settings   Which personally  I find enjoyable to read  I think everyone should pick up this book at least once  but its impact will definitely vary from person to person depending on ones underlying character  Very nice guide for improving relationship with others Great life advice  straight from the mouth of historical greats   Amazing book  One of the best I ever read  Interesting book from the self help department  Surely some helpful things written in it  with nice tips on how to apply certain tricks in dealing with people  Generally  just by rephrasing your thoughts and sentences you can come across in a very different manner  This book gets you to thinking about yourself and encourages self reflection  However  some of the anecdotes are a bit unrealistic in my opinion  For example  someone has a problem with the insurance company as they don t want to pay the full amount one is owed  Then you go and first make the guy from the company feel important and tell him how helping you will benefit him  and on top of that you mention his great reputation to live up to    and just like magic even the most antagonistic counterparty will do as you would like  Take the lessons and applications with a little pinch of salt   I don t think Carnegie would be a fan of most people these days  Published in 1937  it was an overnight hit  eventually selling 15 million copies  Financial success  Carnegie believed  is due 15 percent to professional knowledge and 85 percent to  the ability to express ideas  to assume leadership  and to arouse enthusiasm among people  The book is brilliantly written and opens with fundamental techniques for dealing with people  such as refraining from criticism  expressing sincere appreciation  making people like you by smiling  remembering names  and being a good listener An excellent read for anyone  Edisi Bahasa MelayuAntara tip tip Tiga teknik asas dalam menangani kelakuan manusiaenam kaedah bagaimana membuatkan orang menyukai kita dua belas cara bagi mengubah manusia tanpa mencetuskan konflik This might be most widely known self help book  written quite some time ago  and it does share many issues with the genre  There is a set of principles postulated by the author  not through any obvious research process   supported mostly by anecdotal evidence  subject to selection bias  and big success stories  not likely to be reproducible   On a more philosophical level  many of those successes might be individual wins in a zero sum game  not necessary wins for society At the same time  being written back in 1936  this book had the luxury of talking about many common sense suggestions  Many of them have found more robust evidence since then  are win win  easy to practice  and so have high  return on investment    and it looks like every single such suggestion is mostly ignored today  So  informal by example treatment might still be valuable  by basically picturing and storing in memory the examples of concrete situation where the principles can be used  therefore making them spring to action in future  OutstandingThis book is a must read for everyoneYou will find within methods of how to understand and influence people  essential in any time and societyGreat read  thanks  How to win friends and influence people main pointsCriticising someones work won t get them to do better but the opposite  By praising it you make the person give 150   almost always When motivating someone always discuss about what he gains out of it  how you think of solving his or her problems The royal road to a person s heart is to talk about things he or she treasures most Always try to think from the other person s point of view  People have 2 needs  understanding one another  their place within the social group and the feeling of importance  If you take sides against them then they react so as to acquire that feeling of importance  If you praise them then they will praise you because by doing so they feel they can easily acquire importance by being in the position as to praise their praiser When you win or lose an argument you lose  You lose in the long run  Criticism and beating somebody will fuel him or her to take action against you in the future  Sort of like karma    The all time great and relevant in any decade I have this on audio CD and listen to it over and over in my car  One of the all time classics which makes its case from many years of practical application and real life experiences  The techniques in this book will improve your human interaction  Fact  I haven t read the 2011 version and would be interested to hear what people think about it    Perhaps the first  and probably the best of the positive thinking books so beloved by salespersons and businesspeople  keen to further their careers  It is an instruction manual in how to be nice and not nasty  hard working and not lazy  well organized and not daft  Whether one should be quite so systematically  nice  in order to manipulate people into giving you good jobs or profitable sales is  however  an interesting ethical point   Baca buku ini waktu SMA kelas X  Oh ya ya    kesan pas baca yang kuinget  Lupa gimana cara win dan influencenya  yang membekas sampai sekarang dari buku ini intinya selalulah menjadi legowo atas apa yang Allah takdirkan  berbuat baik semampunya  lemah lembut ke orang lain   An informative and encouraging book which indeed inspires me to make change of my personalities  I read this book because I was looking for any effective and feasible ways to get more friends  And I believe that people can influence people for sure  There are some methods advised by Carnegie for reaching the aim of the book  I will keep trying because I know it will take time to make it come true  The stories are dated but the wisdom is not  Excellent information presented in a logical order  I just wish I d read it 30 years ago  I m going to need to re read it several times to put it into practice  though  Highly recommended   Good ideas in this book  but without the full context I am doubtful I will remember them  This was what I could get from the library quickly though  Powerful ideas  if used in a genuine and sincere manner  If used to manipulate others or for selfish interests then simply another way to promote greed and power over others   I really liked it  Lots of good stuff  I tend to want to run away instead of talking to people  so I figured this could help  I got a little bored during the section that really focused on making a sell  but it is a book I will read again   A well written book  Enjoyed reading it     qbl  n tshr  fy qr  lktb  hnk

view spoiler   1  2  3  4   hide spoiler   I ll admit I was a sceptic  but I really enjoyed this and found it very useful  It s basically a guide on good manners  developing empathy  and not being a selfish arsehole   the added benefits of which are that people want to help people who help them  If you re trying to build a career  particularly in the arts  academia or any field where networking is important   then give this a go  I ve been hesitant to read this for a long time  as I believed it would just be about manipulating and influencing people to your own gain  It wasn t like that all   in fact if I could summarise this book into a simple sentence it would be this  Help others and think about their needs before your own  and you will be amazed at how well it works out for you  It s not really a self help book  it s more of a help others book  I loved the message and the motivations behind this book  I really believe that the world would be a better place if more people read this On a technical level  I usually love Dale Carnegie s communication style in his books  and this is no exception  The whole book is full of stories and real life examples  It s very easy to read and gives you a good summary of each of his points at the end   thanks very much  Great book  highly recommend it   rekomendasi dari seorang temen yang ikutan MLM  mpe sekarang masih berusaha untuk terus menerapkan beberapa point dari buku ini    Great book  And don t let the title stopping you from reading it  since it s not really representative of its content     Great book on developing relationships with other people  While part of the idea behind the book is to get the sale  or get people to do what you want  it s really more about creating a win win for other people and yourself  Basically  treat people right  and they should treat you right in return  while being over half a decade old and sounding like corny and strange life advisor book for socially akward people from today  which totally fits into the 21st century   I must admit I wasn t intrigued too much when my sister bought me this from london heathrow rather than bringing me twiglets and english tea  Anyway  as corny as it may sound  I enjoyed most part of the book  While some of the stuff is outdated  such as I read in a review   calling out everyone s name while talking to them  isn t gonna get you anywhere   but it gives a brief and interesting insight to interpersonal interaction  and yes  this might be aimed a little bit towards sales persons and management executives and it s often pushing things over the edge  but then again  it is better than any  management advice 101  book I ve come across   Really good lessons  Great lessons  but most are common sense or things I already know I read this book on the advice of one of my friends  I think there are some great tips in here for all of us  In a world where we are all so busy the one thing I find myself doing is not being  present  in a conversation   I hate that when it happens to me   so I guess others hate that to  What I liked about this book is that it applies across the board whether you are the CEO or the payroll assistant  There is something in there for everyone  Another thing I liked is that this applies equally to family and friends as it does the work place   An amazing classic and must read  One of the amazing books in dealing with people  recommend it if you re preparing a communication skills training  dale carnegie is just somehow ltt    But you can survive that     Popular read Bijna een eeuw oud  maar nog steeds heel relevant  good advice I didn t know what to expect from this book when I bought it  But what I got was a good injection of common sense and a reminder of things we all know but tend to forget as time passes Only issue I have with it is that some of the stories are quite outdated or over simplified but what can you expect from a 75 year old book  Definitely recommend this book to anyone who seeks to understand the people around you and how to communicate more effectively to get what you want  Still relevant    same concept that s been relevant throughout the ages  Always good to freshen up on your people skills    Very good sampler for ways to increase emotional intelligence and interpersonal relations  Loved the examples  Obviously dated  but still so valid  Key insights  Pick it up  re read this again   first read 30 odd years ago   still relevant today  A great guide on how to deal with all people in life and walk away feeling good about yourself and others  works great with kids  Amazing A lot of the advice in the book was really really helpful  because im quite good at making friends but just not so good at keeping them lol  but i learnt a lot from this book  some of it was just common sense but it was a good book nonetheless and was really well adapted to suit the audience teen girls  Memang sih jadul banget  itupun pinjaman dari teman   karena isinya butuh pengaplikasian  jadinya baca pelan2  sambil berharap 1 1 bisa tersimpan dimemory  Dale Carnegie sampe gaji orang buat riset diperpus untuk isi bukunya  Bolehlah dapat 4 bintang Decent albeit boring insight into social interaction  Some basic and general tips followed by some rather unique advice  It s good at what it does  Powerful  quick read  The detractors of this book are taking the information within it too literally  and that is a losing gambit from the get go  The power of this book comes in the form of inspiration and galvanization  not as a step by step guide to get people to like you  If you read and follow this book literally  you will come across as a good faker  patronizer  or manipulator But read between the lines and you start to understand that the greatest ways to make people like you and to get ahead in life is to change  fundamentally  your view on human relationships  It is to put others  interests in front of your own not simply to get something out of them  but to lead a happier life with more success in sales or other avenues  Basically  this is not a guide so much as it is a wake up call  The only way you can change how the world perceives you is to make a positive change within yourself  and this work gives you many anecdotes and ideas on why and how to make that change  Going up to someone and flattering them is pretentious and patronizing and will never work  Understanding that everyone in this world loves a genuine compliment and loves being recognized  including yourself  will allow you to naturally empathize with people when interacting with them  This is just one of many lessons this short book has taught me Highly Recommended   it was quiet interesting and very enlightening   lktb jyd jd fyh tshwyq wm lwmt

gente y cambiar la forma de relacionarse Esta basado en ejemplos de principio de siglo  How To Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie is a classic  I have been told over and over again  especially within the business world  that this is a must read book  ironically  for how much this book is recommended  it is rarely followed   I can understand why it is a classic  it is certainly sound advice  but a lot of it also strikes me as fairly common sense  aka the Golden Rule The book is divided into three parts covering the following 30 principles  Don t criticize  condemn  or complain      Give honest and sincere appreciation      Arouse in the other person an eager need or want      Become genuinely interested in other people      Smile      Remember that a person s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language      Be a good listener  Encourage others to talk about themselves      Talk in terms of the other person s interests      Make the other person feel important   and do it sincerely      The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it      Show respect for other person s opinions  Never say   You re wrong       If you are wrong  admit it quickly and emphatically      Begin in a friendly way      Get the other person saying  yes  yes  immediately      Let the other person do a a great deal of the talking      Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers      Try honestly to see things from the other persons point of view      By synthetic with the other person s ideas and desires      Appeal to the other nobler motives      Dramatize your ideas      Throw down a challenge      Begin with praise and honest appreciation      Call attention to people s mistakes indirectly      Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person      Ask questions instead of giving direct orders      Let the other person save face      Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement  Be  hearty in your appreciation and lavish in your praise       Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to      Use encouragement  Make the fault seem easy to correct      Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest     It s not a long book  and I think reading the book over a month  a principle a day  is definitely worth your time  It ll give you food for thought  or at least remind you of some principles you might have forgotten  Quotes I have had some interesting correspondence with Lewis Lawes  who was warden of New York s infamous Sing Sing prison for many years  on this subject  and he declared that  few of the criminals in Sing Sing regard themselves as bad men  They are just as human as you and I  So they rationalise  they explain  They can tell you why they had to crack a safe or be quick on the trigger finger  Most of them attempt by a form of reasoning  fallacious or logical  to justify their antisocial acts even to themselves  consequently stoutly maintaining that they should never have been imprisoned at all   This actually reminds me about the book  Mistakes Were Made  But Not By Me  which deals with logical fallacies and how we justify past mistakes and errors  Dr  Dewey said that the deepest urge in human nature is  the desire to be important  You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you  One of the finest book for practical guidance in life I have read in childhood like a Bible  read this again in 2010  and realized I had put a lot of these principles into practice in the almost 10 years since my first reading of it  Many of the examples are outdated  and involved military sphere as opposed to real world scenarios   In this classic book  Carnegie emphasizes the importance of genuine empathy when dealing with others in both professional and personal relationships  Here are a few quotes that stood out to me     A hen has to lay eggs  a cow has to give milk  and a canary has to sing  But a dog makes his living by giving you nothing but love      A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men      If you want to be a good conversationalist  be an attentive listener    This book is one of the staples of the personal development literature  and it proclaims a positive message which is not heard often enough  Become GENUINELY interested in people This one sentence captures the essence of this book  and it is a fundamental paradigm shift that will revolutionize the way you interact with people  to greater mutual satisfaction  One of the few character development books I ve read  The book was interesting  It seemed practical to apply  But I didn t read it to apply it in real life  The book seemed interesting and fun  So I read it  The point by point instructions and Advices were really good  I mean  I can see people applying these techniques and gaining popularity  Anyway  Although i read it for fun  it influenced me a little too  If you wish to read it you have my GO AHEAD signal  A well written book  Enjoyed reading it    Worth reading  How to be a boring ass superficial person  Dale Carnegie s book is a classic must read  A book about social interaction concepts that  although simple  are essential to understanding how people work  If you systematically apply the concepts taught  you ll notice your network not just grow in size  but the quality of your relationships grow much deeper  Carnegie introduced a simple concept and then backs it up with factual examples  One concept  for example  is to gain a genuine interest in what interests someone ELSE  Abraham Lincoln used to invite people over to his home for dinner  and the night before would stay up educating himself on a topic of interest to his houseguests  The next day  as you d expect  his guests enjoyed a great time filled with riveting conversation about what was interesting to HIM  Apart from few of the concepts being quite simple  my only serious concern with this book and the reason for the four stars is that IT IS SO CORNY  totally in line with the genre of books written in the 1930s  Every page I feel like I m talking to a sales guy and he s not letting me get a word in  I still strongly recommend this book to all who may be interested  but be warned that you have to get passed this corny 1930s writing style in order to give the book merit  Hopefully it ll be easier for you than it was for me  A very popular book in my parent s time  Unfortunately it seems a bit out dated in today s context  The English version is a lot better than the Chinese version  Though this is certainly a useful book  I find it more helpful to observe from life if I want to learn  how to win friends and influence people   Excellent book that compiles suggestions related to applying empathy  respect and common courtesy to better relate with other people  nice book but it s boring at the end with so many examples Good tips for influencing peoplethe book is great but by the end it really repetitive  you could get all the information out of the book by just reading the first 3 parts of the book  3 5 stars really  Dated yet interesting anecdotes  Timeless advice  Not so good title  but dont judge book by cover  Fundamental human relationship ideas are great This is a hard one for me to review  On one hand it has a lot of incredible advice that I have found to be true especially for a book as old as it is  On the other hand  much of Carnegie s writing comes across as manipulative  One of the truthful statements he makes is  When dealing with people  let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic   and overall the book is his summary of how to get these illogical humans to do what you want  This illogical human has crazy ideals that one day people will be a little more real and genuine and thus I can t say I love everything he writes  Regardless  this is definitely a worthwhile read  One of those books that I always heard everyone should read in their lifetime  It has some good tips on managing others  albeit a bit obvious  A quick read that reinforces that kindness and humility go a long way     A interesting read for anyone looking for improving inter personal skills  The keys ideas through out the book is about try to praise instead of criticize  be interested in other people and think from the other people s perspective  These are good high level ideas to remember  although it will take real experience to see if these high level ideas can be used to deal with more complex situations in real life   Great  4 5   A must read for anyone looking to improve their social skills  Actually  this should be a required read for everyone  period  Unless you re a hermit  this book really makes you see social dynamics in a whole new light  Many people might think that all the principles delineated in the book are  common sense  and  obvious   But really  it s one thing to understand and another to be able to practice it  You can read book after book on how to play golf and not be able to play at all  even though you  understand  it and every move makes sense to you Understanding and doing are completely different  and it s when you do actually put the principles to use that you see the results  It s unbelievable how these simple  commonsensical principles are NOT practiced by people  And it s amazing how actually using them in your daily life produces results you have never expected before The only complaint I have for this excellent book is that its later part didn t have enough concrete examples to illustrate how to use the principles  thus the 4 5 it gets   Other than that  all the anecdotes were fascinating  principles well explained and well organized  and every bit of information was useful to the highest degree  I haven t come across a book that s so simple in its contents and yet so useful HIghly recommended  This book is important It s breezy  applicable to any pursuit  and it s filled with quaint  old timey language  And because it s so wisdom packed and I m such a slow study  I plan to re read it like once a year  The poor reviews of this book are amusing  claiming this book wants to turn you into a manipulator  not a friendly person  Perhaps they see it that way  and I can see why they might  but the message I got from this book was the power of positivity  Dale Carnegie points out how the application of a positive mindset  that looks out for positives instead of negatives  can vastly improve your life and those around you  It does not encourage manipulation  it simply points out basics of human psychology  tells you a lot of stories about people who used positive reinforcement instead of negative  something any first year psychology student will learn  and how this led to them achieving their means much more pleasantly than if they had taken a bitter  angry  condescending  forceful or otherwise negative approach  I ve read or heard most of these tips myself over the years  but it is eye opening to read everything collated  Old sayings make a lot more sense and I m hoping to strive to be less of an argumentative person  as I tend to find myself in a lot of arguments that lead to everyone being angry and disappointed  The main point is to be nice  Don t pick fights  Consider the feelings of the other person  be empathetic and put yourself in their shoes before you say a thing  How that is in any way manipulative or bad is not something I can comprehend  If more people socialised in this way the world would be a far more tolerant  pleasant place to exist in   Um livro intemporal  simples  directo e extremamente util  Recomendo

to anyone that works or lives with people  So   to everyone  Some say it s only applicable to salesmen but I think it s application is limitless   Very good it took me for ever  I build rapport with people now The title seems to turn some people off  However  if you can get past that  there are some great tips in here that can help us build friendships  which is what I m more interested in than  winning friends  as if they are cupie dolls   Helpful although commonly taught now  the knowledge in this book inspired me to become a better person  It is enjoyable read and extremely convicting  If it was good enough for Warren Buffett  it s good enough for me  This book has a lot of old fashioned  simple maxims and techniques that it never hurts to review    How to Win Friends and Influence People  http   readwithstyle wordpress com 20   According to Goodreads  the Facebook for the reading geeks   I started reading How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie on the 10th of June and I finished it on the 21st of October  No  I didn t read a page per day  nor did I read it alongside other books  I simply decided to start reading it on the 10th of June and then I gave up  I decided to start reading it several times afterwards and again I gave up after opening it on my Kindle and seeing the first page  What made this book so repulsive to me was the title and the caption below it  How to Win Friends and Influence People sounded to me more like How to Manipulate People into Liking you and How to Manipulate Them into Doing Whatever You Want  Definitely not the type of skill I am looking for in life  I rather not manipulate people into being my friends  I would rather for them to like me for who I am  however difficult that might be   And also  I definitely don t feel like manipulating people into doing what I want  I would prefer if they do it because I manage to convince them using logic  intelligence  charm  or   well other purely feminine skills      Secondly  the caption is a quote from Warren Buffet    Carnegie  changed my life   As much as I admire Mr  Buffet and as much as I enjoy reading his interviews  stories about his life  and memorable quotations  my strong contempt for self help books is stronger  I have expressed numerous times the view that the self help authors of the sort of Jorge Bucay  Andy Andrews  etc  do harm people rather than help them  The well digested wisdom of positive thinking and positive affirmations  and the idea of looking at life through pink coloured glasses doesn t in any way alter people s attitude towards that same life  It just teaches them how to focus on changing outward actions instead of inward thoughts So you would understand my utter unwillingness to read How to Win Friends and Influence People  This book has been recommended to me by one of my best friends for quite a long time and only this recommendation did actually make me finally read it this month  As I have said  books have that special power of finding you exactly when you need them the most  If I had read How to Win Friends and Influence People months back  I doubt I would have been as much impressed by Carnegie as I am now I am slowly getting to the point that Dale Carnegie s How to Win Friends and Influence People is not about how to manipulate people  It is rather about how to change your approach towards people and how to understand and fight the natural flaws of the human character  and most importantly of the human ego  Initially  Carnegie started teaching seminars to business people on how to more efficiently deal with their colleagues  on how to tackle conflicts in the working space and on how to win people over to their thinking  These seminars eventually translated into How to Win Friends and Influence People  which lessons can be applied not only with colleagues  but with friends  family  and even with random people you get in contact with Read more  http   readwithstyle wordpress com 20    I was surprised when I read this that it was written in the 30s  It is still relevant today  I am applying the principles and already seeing results  Impressive  mn lktb lly thrt bHyty    kthr mn 6 snwt   qrth lln lkn m yzl b D fkrh  lqh    yw sfny nh mt mntHr w nh lm yTbq m kn yktbh All good points  lots of things to think about that will make you a nice person to be around The end  a chapter on marriage  is  quaint  to the point of being sexist  Most of the points boil down to respect and enthusiasm  but they re phrased in archaic and regressive language That considered  I think the book is a non skeezy collection of legitimate suggestions for improving how you handle people in all situations of life  Okay  you know what  yes  I read How to Win Friends and Influence People  Even though it s corny There s some good stuff in here  None of of it is ground breaking but man would it be nice if more people followed some of these suggestions  myself included  So  working on that Also  a lot of little anecdotes  some of which were terrifying  To get someone to do what you want  make them the leader of the thing  Like the lady who was having problems with boys rushing over her lawn and ruining her garden  so she made the ringleader the Chief Inspector Of Not Screwing Up The Garden  And it worked so well  he made a bonfire  heated up an iron rod in it  and threatened to brand the other boys if they ran across the garden  How about that  Just dandy  Dale  Yea  yea  the title sounds stupid  but what a great book  I believe the world would be a better place if everyone were to read this  I m trying to improve my charisma  and I ve heard this book recommended many times  so I decided to check it out  It was excellent  with simple  easily understood  though perhaps not so easily implemented  suggestions for improving one s human interactions The basic point of the book is to suppress one s own ego and to cultivate a genuine interest in other people  Most of us  me definitely included  are very protective of our own egos and are often too busy caring for them to pay attention to others I definitely recommend the book to anyone who has to deal with people daily  Which is  of course  everyone  I wasn t going to give it such a high rating but I tried it at a critical moment and wouldn t you know  The nonfiction book  How to Win Friends and Influence People  is a book that Dale Carnegie wrote to give you tips on how to better yourself with your friends and others involved in your everyday life  He starts by giving you techniques on how to handle people and ends with showing you how to become a leader The theme of this book is that you can always find things to help your social skills  Throughout the book  Carnegie teaches you essential  do s  and  don t s  when it comes to bettering your social life and overall outlook in life  Carnegie s style of this book is listing  he uses listing by cutting his main points into parts and his parts into chapters  This style gives you the most important points that he is trying to get you to understand  The style of this book is a narration because it goes in order on what you must do first to achieve a better overall social appearance and better social skills  I think that this book was very eye opening and has changed my view points socially as well as ways that I can influence people  This book was a different read for me for sure but I was quite pleased with what this book left me with  I would not change anything about this book because it is so well written and I think that anyone who is trying to better themselves socially   I think this was a fun little book  there are a lot of little tips and tricks to help you get people on your side  I dont think it was really a super deep book  but it was fun  there were a lot of fun examples of his principles  it was just a fun book  well written  ay yn dwst yby How to Win Friends and Influence People  Dale Carnegie  ktb ry

basics of humans behavior  The title is a bit of a constraint for few as they would think it is not for normal humans  But this book is not only about making friends  its about developing a thought process which will help in being a more considerate and an understanding person  A book for all who wants to get better of themselves  What a classic  This book lays out a plan you can use to succeed in life To make friends Never criticize  show sincere appreciation  find out what others want and show them how to get it  become interested in them  smile at them  and know their name To Influence Praise and appreciate  ask questions instead of giving a direct order  give the other person a reputation to live up to  and make the other person happy about doing what you suggest   A book I would recommend reading to all  It s a little bit full on for regular reading and isn t quite a page turner but I think the messages in it are fundamental to a successful and happy life  You ll be amazed at the the little things in life that you overlook or are very causal with  There s a reason it s so popular as it can often be a real wake up call  Always refreshing to flick through a few pages and I gurantee you ll take something out of the pages  This book gives you a great view of reality and being able to get along with almost everyone  Even though the book was written a few decades back  the basics still hold true today  For those looking to understand what society is slowly losing this is a great way to realize there is more to life than technology  This is a must read to help you become more than what you are  it little boring in the beginning of reading this book    but in first one third it very helpful   you will enjoy it    the book like hear experiences of grand or old man    your tongue be out your mouth waiting next step of writer s storys        But the most important thing that you must to read it more than once it will helpful you     you must apply what you read in your life Great book on understanding people  This is a practical book  a lifelong learning process to connect you to the hidden new opportunities that exist in front of you  I have always been curious of not being able to connect with my loved ones for so long  But the author of the book has introduced me to the whole new concept of love and caring  The problem I had was that I was focusing too much on myself rather than the people I want to connect with  I have tried to practice the skills lately and I m glad I found them helpful   It s a life changing book and I recommend to anyone who wants to improve your relationship  You won t be disappointed  I wish I had found it earlier in my life  human connected It just tells you how to be a good person   A classic in the business self help section  Lots of good advice and common sense from Carnegie   The classic of self help books  A book most people could be helped by reading  It s written in a style that is perhaps uncommon today  but if you can read it with this in mind and trying to understand the moral of the story  it s great  If there is ever going to be a unified theory of human behavior  this book will have played an important role in developing it  Even though its examples are oriented towards people of business  naturally  since it was developed as a development paying course   its useful insights into the human psychology can be applied by everyone and in a variety of situations I am definitely reading it again in the future  This was a great book  Some of the examples are kind of dated  but all of the content is absolutely relevant in today s world  I still look back at it fairly regularly to stay sharp with my interpersonal skills  I may even take a Dale Carnegie class in the future   What a great book  It has so many stories how people were in poverty and without friendship and were very sad and lonely even made fun of  They found that if they applied gospel principles of service  finding worth in others  education ect      as they lived gospel principles at the same time with others  feeling the same wonderful spirit of progression at the same time  People build eternal friendships and gained happiness  without the connector of Gospel principles  I would rather be alone   Preparing me for a new job in management  Mr Persona does it right  It took me some time but I finally finished reading this book  I picked this book up because one day I hope to be someone s boss and I want to be the best boss I can be  There are too many people in upper positions who are simply mean  nasty and degrading to their staff  This books gives real life situations and techniques on how to deal with people  This book is helpful in my current position as a teacher because my students are people and even though I am  in charge  I need to make sure I treat them with respect and dignity  Wonderful book   simple and common sense  yet in real life is hard to follow and remember the principles mentioned in this valuable book  I think everybody should read this book at least once  but me I am going to create a poster from its nutshell and put it on my wall as a reminder  I finished this as an audiobook a year ago now  gave it two stars and generally wasn t very impressed  Time wore on  Through some glitch on my iPod  whenever my audiobook of choice ended  chapters of this would pop up again  and again  and again  Sometimes I was so bored I listened  and you have to give it to the Caesar  some of the examples were rather funny I started applying some of the stuff  which was rather basic  and it worked  While I didn t have any major issues with the people beside me  I wasn t exactly enamored with society and when miscommunications happened I wasn t stellar in dealing with them  Long story short  people were generally separated in those who could do damage and those who couldn t and the general approach was to treat with both as little as possible I won t give it away  because you can t take the main 20 ish pieces of advice in the book without the book  I can tell you that my writing  which could have been pigeon holed into condensed  succinct or sarcastic has started to develop a rather human tone on the way and while I still don t speak in public as well or as often as I should  I am more fluent  confident and it feels like less of a burden   A timeless read You can find all sorts of things wrong with this book   outdated examples  language etc  I enjoyed this thougt provoking and well researched book tremendously  I realise mistakes made and ingrained my whole life  I beleive that even though advice and examples sound naive  human nature stays esentially the same and should these principles be applied the way the author intended  they will bear fruit  To apply these pricipals would be more difficult though and just reading the book without applying yourself to it will not help much  For this reason I will read it again soon  This book is amazing Author speaks on positive self image   initiating and controlling our thoughts  practical advice and techniques for how to make life rewarding I found this book more useful in the way i do conversations with people  my friends  my colleagues   my way of starting conversations   making friends and winning them is so important and i am changing myself after reading this book using the points to win every friend by giving importance to them to their opinions totally to influence them using some great examples from this book The Fundamental points are trying to avoid arguments   showing respect to their conversation   admitting quickly if we are wrong  listening and encouraging others to talk about themselves  instead of complaining giving honest and sincere appreciation making the other person feel important   Once i remember Michael in his visit to Chennai we went down to Nuts and Spices store to buy a energy refreshing drinks   where he remembers the Store Cashier Name that shows we are giving importance to him and he in returns same to us   This made clear that make people starting liking us by showing Interest in them   smile  remembering the persons name is to that person is great   since Name is sweetest sound in any language Book teaches us how to work with others and be nice it s about how to get along with people   Praising and encouraging every improvement and Progress  This book turns our relationships around and improve our interactions with everyone in our life  This is probably one of the most influential books I ve ever read and I would highly recommend for everyone to read it at least once in their lives  It details how people think gives brief anecdotes in order to improve your relations with other people  Even if you think you have superior social skills  I still think this is an important addition to everyone s library  Highly recommend  Very short read  Some of the anecdotes are repetitive and  in my opinion  unnecessary   Good review of friendships and business relationships  particularly liked principles of leadership and reminiscing about my past relationship with authority  such as great professors and employers who have demonstrated several of these traits  Easy and recognizable qualities that we can all benefit from in practice and demonstration daily  We all require this read and practice in behavior to succeed emotionally and professionally  Sf  Great suggestions on becoming a more personable individual  With the right motives  this techniques can be very effective  Excellent book on how to lead with smiley faces  It works in practice  One of best entrepreneur book I have read  The book is easy to understand direct and interesting  It starts with the very least talent in social and interpersonal skills to the highest  thats why i advise whoever is reading this book to take it one step at a time and never skip or jump from one topic to another  Mostly common sense stuff  but really good to review  Key is to keep practicing the tips Carnegie suggests  things not to do My First Dale Carnegie book and I must admit I am thoroughly impressed with what a mere 300 odd pages book has to offer How to Win Friends and Influence People was recommended to me by my friend cum colleague Chintan Bhatt  Sadly  it took close to 2 weeks to finish reading this book as I was reading through an e book and e books really do slow down my pace of reading My job requires me to converse with Directors and Senior most Managers from the Corporate Biggies across the globe which I must confess tends to get unnerving  I mean  okay  it is one thing to manage to squeeze two minutes out of their precious time for yourself and an altogether different thing to make them listen to what I wish to convey and demand of them It is tough and moreso when you do not have a tactic on hand to go about successfully achieving your goal  During a casual discussion  I voiced out my concerns as to how it is next to impossible to speak to the concerned person and get your job done through them  That s when Chintan mentioned to me that I should read this book if I wish to make my clients want to do what I want  And it sure is an immense help toward changing the way you look at things and improving the way you interact with people Effective conversation is essential in professional as well as personal life  And the most important driving factor is selfless interaction  Being kind and nice is the key to successful interaction and with exemplary instances does Dale elaborate them  These few lines are stuck in my memory even though I finished the book long back  It isn t what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy  It is what you think about it   It is not meant for a particular age or group of people but useful for everyone  A must read if you feel that your conversation with someone is leading you nowhere  Try this book and feel the difference yourself  This book was given to me by a bishop  years ago   Hm  I wonder what he was trying to teach me   0  Actually  he gave it anyone who would accept it It is one of the best  self help  books ever written  Down to earth  filled with REAL stories  this book has made me more of an Audrey Hepburn than a Katharine  Overall  A well written book with a lot of examples  including many of good folks from the history and many without any citation  but none the less seem real  The examples are written so that the message goes across well  Repetition is avoided  The stuff mentioned is pretty obvious and simple  but important and often ignored  Worth reading multiple times as the preface recommends  TEXT DELETED105 SIX WAYS TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOUPRINCIPLE 1  Become genuinely interested in other people  PRINCIPLE 2  SmilePRINCIPLE 3  Remember that a person s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language  PRINCIPLE 4  Be a good listener  Encourage others to talk about themselves  PRINCIPLE 5  Talk in terms of the other person s interests  PRINCIPLE 6  Make the other person feel important and do it sincerely  110 You cannot win an argumentWhy not let him save his face  He didn t ask for your opinion  He didn t want it  Why argue with him  Always avoid the acute angle  Don t forget this lesson  I have come to the conclusion that there is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an argument  and that is to avoid it  You can t win an argument  You can t because if you lose it  you lose it  and if you win it  you lose it  Why  Well  suppose you triumph over the other man and shoot his argument full of holes and prove that he is non compos mentis  Then what  You will feel fine  But what about him  You have made him feel inferior  You have hurt his pride  He will always resent your triumph and  a man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still     112 Which would you rather have  an academic theatrical victory or a person s good will  You can seldom have both  Buddha said   Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love   and a misunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by tact  diplomacy  conciliation  and a sympathetic desire to see the other person s viewpoint  Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right  Even killing the dog would not cute the bite  114 How to keep a disagreement from becoming an argument 1  Welcome the disagreement  Remember the slogan   When two partners always agree  one of them is not necessary   If there is some point you haven t thought about  be thankful if it is brought to your attention  Perhaps this disagreement is your opportunity to be corrected before you make a serious mistake  2  Distrust your first instinctive impressions  Our first natural reaction in a disagreeable situation is to be defensive  Be careful  Keep calm and watch out for your first reaction  It may be you at your worst  not at your best  3  Control your temper  Remember  you can measure the size of a person by what makes him or her angry  4  Listen first  Give your opponents a chance to talk  Let them finish  Do not resist  defend  or debate  This only raises barriers  Try to build bridges of understanding  Don t build higher barriers of misunderstanding  5  Look for areas of agreement  When you have heard your opponents out  dwell first on the points and areas on which you agree  6  Be honest  Look for areas where you can admit error and say so  Apologize for your mistakes  It will help disarm your opponents and reduce defensiveness  7  Promise to think over your opponents  ideas and study them carefully  and mean it  Your opponents may be right  It is a lot easier at this stage to agree to think about their points than to move rapidly ahead and find yourself in a position where your opponents can say   We tried to tell you  but you wouldn t listen   8  Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest  Anyone who takes the time to adisagree with you is interested in the same things you are  Think of them as people who really want to help you  and you may turn your opponents into friends  9  Postpone actions to give both sides time to think through the problem  Suggest that a new meeting be held later that day or the next day  when all the facts may be brought to bear to preparation for this meeting  ask yourself some hard questions  Could my opponents be right  Partly right  Is there truth or merit in their position or argument  Is my reaction one that will relieve the problem or will it just relieve any frustration  Will my reaction drive my opponents further away or draw them closer to me  Will my reaction elevate the estimation good people have of me  Will I win or lose  What price will I have to pay if I win  If I am quiet about it  what the disagreement blow over  Is this difficult situation an opportunity for me  PRINCIPLE 1  The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it  MORE LATER     A well written book  Enjoyed reading it    Reading this was the starting point for pulling me out of being a painfully introverted geeky jerk  This stuff should be common sense  but as some have said  common sense isn t common   This is an incredible book  I highly recommend it for those people who are in sales   Started re reading for work but finding some value in it in everyday life too   o  Thanks to Dale Carnegie  this book influenced the changes I made in my life  Although this book is old  many of its content are still current  One of the most important aspects in any area of our professional lives focus on the relationship with other people   Lots of good info  A lot of it might seem obvious  but it s worth reading for anyone who is lonely  I would give it a five out five stars rating if it was better written and some of the examples in paragraphs were not wholly unrelated to the paragraph s topic sentences  Not as dated as it may seem  Everything is practical  but also kind of obvious  Good info   One of those classics   which never age  First published in 1936   still very relevant   Thoroughly enjoyed reading it   as it was very relevant to my lack in understanding and dealing with other people  The book continuously talks to the reader in ways that make the book very personal   It made me see things which i was completely unaware of and were definitely affecting how people see me    This book teaches you how  when interacting with people  you should think less about  me  me  me   and try and focus more on the other person  This is something that I forget most of the times  and this book taught me to be a little bit more considerate about the other person s thoughts  judge less  and  most importantly  admit more that even if I m right  this doesn t make the other person be wrong It s mostly a book that teaches about tolerance  diplomacy and being friendly  suggests that you give more honest compliments  smile more often and have more empathy towards others  I saved lots of notes from this book  and I will surely go back to read them again from time to time  Bellissimo libro  mi sta aiutando tantissimo in molti frangenti   I read this book in college and it made me realize how important it is to smile at people and be a good listener  Two very simple things but a lot of people don t do them  Wish more people would read this book   I have this audio book and yes  you CAN have the jobs you want  I read this book in Dutch and really liked it  Some examples are localized so it makes more sense if you re not American  The book is easy to read and the examples are realistic  Since I read the book I m more aware of how I communicate and I m surprised of the results  Muito massa  Mas um pouco massante a leitura  Good book  I wish the publishers would have let Dale publish the infamous  last chapter   This was a great book  I loved the fact that Dale Carnegie included so many true life stories and examples to back up the points he made  Although the mains ideas of the story are fairly common sense  it is amazing how many people do not use these ideas when interacting with others  I am interested in considering using this book as a nonfiction text with 8th grade students  We will see if the opportunity presents itself in the future     d  lqlq w bd lHy

aspect  Social Intelligence   still looking for a good book on that one  This book surprised the hell out of me  I thought I would hate it  I really dislike  self help  books  There were a lot of  duh  types of tips  but a lot of the advice given were things I had never thought of before  at least in the way he suggested  Definitely something everyone should read   I ve heard of the book for a very long time  but I hate things hyped by everyone  so I didn t read it when it was published in my country  I also thought that the title was so cheap and this book just contained tricks to deal with people and  win  them  I have to admit I was wrong  This book summed up the most basic rule in human relationship  you have to treat people with sincerity  and you have to have genuine interest in people  The techniques in this book will not work without that as a base  I really like it  and I learned one thing or two from the book  However I still think that there are bitches which you cannot  win  or  influence   They just deserve your slaps  Awesome book with really relevant principles for today s  me first  world  HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE   Based on my personality I don t have the ability to persuade people  Most of the time I want to spend my time alone rather than to spend it with others  Even if i m introvert by nature doesn t mean I can survive without people  God said  It s not good for a man to be alone  and  No man is an island  according to the English poet John Donne  We can t achieve success and solve our problems alone  Revealing our feeling is the beginning of healing Winning friends and influencing people is indeed a very tough work  You can t do it in just a snap  I believe that we can t make everybody love us  There s always a so called basher or a hater in our lives  Bill Cosby quoted  I don t know the key to success but the key to failure is trying to please everyone   Attracting people can be done usually by a famous celebrity  politician  or if you re working in sales or any business related jobs The bible says       Our purpose is to please God  not people  He alone examines the motives of our hearts   1 Thessalonians 2 4   Even if there ll be times in our lives that we should please people for a certain reason we must not be gone astray from the real purpose  Once we put our security to God  our relationship with people will put into a perspective  We ll learn the counter cultural way of loving our neighbors as ourselves  We ll learn how to treat others with selfless love  dignity  and respect regardless of how we feel  So in case you win a friend or influence a person  it s not because of you alone but because of God s intervention and purpose  Because you decided to please God in every area of your life  you ll be used as an influence to share the message of God s love and salvation to others through your words and actions  This is a reminder to each and everyone of us   Although I was very sceptical of the title of this book  this very soon changed when I started reading it  It is exceptionally  hands on   and you can start using what he writes immediately  It really is a  dummies  guide for how to get along with people  Following his advice  read every chapter twice  make notes     allow for better remembering his many tips  I already recommended it to a number of people  great book  but just for fun  nothing of value and it tells you what you already know  but it was fun to read and finish Not as good as the 7 habits  and     when reading this  I kept imagining Stewie reading it out loud to me  Yeah    seems like the guy would have a british accent  and be a  jolly old chap  right o  Still   srsly though  highly effective information  examples  and a healthy dose of history on why historic people were as popular and effective as they were  This is also helping me in my quest to become a better person  isplati se procitat there was too many obvious things but still everything it said was true  how to interact with people   If you don t know where or whom to ask about anything  then ask a good book  as my late mom often said  Don t worry  confuse on how to deal with people accordingly  Then  ask Dale Carnegie    When I first saw the title of this book I thought it to be a rather manipulative sounding title  But when I opened the pages and began to partake in these common knowledge  but not commonly practiced  principles    I became very enthralled and enlightened  The only thing that I have against this book is that once each principle is laid out and a few examples are given  there really is no need to drag out the point for another couple of pages or so  This book has changed the way I perceive people  the way they act  and the things they say  We all want to find approval and all want to feel important  That s what this book is about  not winning or influencing  but genuinely caring about the needs of others  Having a servant s heart  Haven t read the English edition but the Vietnamese one is simply beautiful  fun and witty  I read this to help me write a research paper on comunication and I was surprised at how good it was  Had it not been for my research paper  I doubt I ever would have picked up this book  but I m glad that I did  Loved this book  sage old wisdom for inter personal relations   Great book with life changing lessons  Excellent and timeless advice on personal relations  Information was practical and written in text easy to understand  Good  basic applied psychology  I read this book on my friend s recommendation  I am very thankful to my friend  Publisher  and all those people made this book Specially thanks to great person DALE CARNEGIE                  I personally believe EVERYONE should read this book   it s that good  This is a classic book  Although some of the examples are a bit old fashioned  the advice on people skills is timeless  I never liked the title much  It s not about manipulating people  it s about having sincere  good relationships with people  whether in business or life  I recommend it for anyone wanting to learn good people skills  and who can t use that  it s a great book  esp the end where it talks abt how to handle people  but agree with author that all techniques would only work with the right intent and motive I loved this book  it has made me reevaluate how I talk with people  I would have given it 5 starts if I didn t feel like every paragraph in the last 100 pages started with  so and so took our course and said this   ktb sbq llkl fy bbh   wkl mn  lf b dh qtbs mnh lfZ w m n  This is one book that I re read every other year  It contains practical advice when dealing with people  along with inspirational anecdotes and quotes that drive home the points the author is trying to make   Este libro  en un comienzo  me parecio fantasioso e incluso peligroso  comenzando por el titulo  que parecia casi digno de serial killer  que miedo que alguien lea como influenciar a los demas   Sin embargo  la curiosidad y el hecho de que sea un texto icono  recomendado en tantas listas de clasicos  me hizo intentarlo de todas formas Me alegro de ello  porque resulta que lo encontre BUENISIMO  Me enternecio y me hizo reir  y es que vi a tantas personas conocidas en sus relatos  Tambien a mi misma  Me causo tanta gracia  y ademas esta tan bien escrito  No solo aprendi  sino que tambien lo disfrute  Me hizo sentir simpatia por todo el genero humano y con la simpatia    bueno  con la simpatia se logra todo Creo que es un libro amable y  aunque algunos ejemplos lleguen a ser sospechosos    me lo crei  Tiene sentido  No opino  como dicen otras criticas  que sea un texto meramente complaciente y zalamero  sobre como caer bien mintiendo    en vez  siento que es un tratado acertado sobre los beneficios de saber escuchar  y las consecuencias de tratar a la gente con amor  y tambien a uno mismo  El amor hace florecer todo  incluso a las personas  Hace que uno quiera cooperar  en vez de oponerse  Hace que todos brillemos  tanto los que dan la mano  como los que la toman  cuando recordamos que somos un equipo En fin  que me encanto  A poner sus ideas en practica  Solo le pongo cuatro estrellas porque tanto ejemplo  a veces me hacia sentir que estaba en un curso de como vender por telefono o algo asi  jajaja  Pero tal vez mas adelante le ponga cinco  Primero tengo que digerirlo  This book in a nutshell Dont be a dick  Just good advice  I hopped all over this book  so I don t know if I can say I truly read it in its entirety  There was so much good advice and if I wasn t a dimwit  I could remember it and give a quality review  I do remember something about not copying current phrases and words  be original  Also  there was a lot of tips about speaking in front of a crowd  things you might not think of like  Don t have a panel of people behind you because their fidgeting will distract everyone  This is a book I would highlight up if I owned it  I read this when I was a teenager because I had heard a lot about it  From what I remember i thought it was great and remember thinking how different the world would be if more people adopted it s concepts  Bacaan gw waktu SMA  dan sumpah  sangat berguna untuk hidup  Wonderful  Timeless  sage advice on how to think positively towards others  Found it very repetitive towards the end  I thought this book was great  Some reviews have said that it is teaching the reader to be manipulative  but it is never manipulative to simply know how to get along with people  Nothing was totally earth shakingly different and yet I found that I could immediately use the principles in my life  It is definitely written more for a salesperson business person type of perspective  but I thought is also totally applicable to all relationships  Parenting including   from this book we learn many of self control and understanding others A little hokey in parts  but overall a good  practical  albeit somewhat obvious guide for dealing successfully with people  Sometimes it paints a rather bleak and narcissistic picture of the human race  but I can t say that s terribly incorrect  Basically  be kind  be humble and recognize that everyone desperately wants to be significant and live a life of meaning  Helping others feel that way is the quickest way to connect with them and help you accomplish your objectives  It sounds cold and self serving  but I don t get the sense Carnegie means anything other than how to connect sincerely with others and suceed    after all  he s giving people career advice  It s worth a read  especially as a classic of the self help genre  Overall I think this is a really useful book which I would recommend to anyone  However  I think it s important to understand that this is way of initially starting relationships  These tactics are not sustainable long term  One thing that the book supports but doesn t clearly point out is that people are drawn to those who seem to care about them  It points out the ways which we might not notice that tell people we care about them   This book taught me to see things from the perspective of others and take accountability for my own successes and failures  baguuuuus A great book recommended by my father and I really found this book really useful in terms of dealing with people in general and as the title suggests wining friends A great book that I recommend to anyone the only problem that I see with this book is that it is a bit outdated but at the same time way ahead of its time Some good suggestions and reminders about relating better with others   in a nutshell putting others first  Helps me sometimes  but really has to remember it if i need to  It seems I would see references to this book everywhere I turned  so I decided to read it  It s got great content and gives some really good advice about how to handle relationships with people  Some of the concepts were pretty obvious but it doesn t hurt to go over common courtesy  I found it had a lot of topics and advice that has helped me personally more than it has with my relationships  Regardless  this is a book everyone should read  Good book to enjoy reading  I m sure this will not be the last time I read this book  An excellent summary of techniques in leadership that I m sure will be useful into the future  The first half of this book was far more interesting to me than the second  mainly because I m not currently in any sort of position of authority  but it was all great information for in introvert such as me  We shall see in the coming weeks just how big of an impact it had on me  but I m hoping I can keep many of the things listed in mind when dealing with others  as it not only seems like it will improve my social life  providing it works well   but will make me feel better about the person I am   I m giving it 4 stars because of the importance of the book  If everyone applied even just a few points from it  life in general would be a lot more enjoyable  That being said  about 80  of the book is anecdotal and at times  reading another story about someone improving something at their workplace gets a bit tedious  A lot of the points made in the book aren t ground breaking and you re unlikely to discover something you ve never heard before  but the points still merit mention since so few people regularly apply them  I d give it 3 stars but the extra star will give it more visibility  Worth going through at least once   A very nice book that portrays the human psyche and how to get into the good books of others  A great read for understanding people and developing relationships  It is a very useful and iluminating book  It is not boring at all but on the contrary  Dale Carnagie made it enjoyable and easy to read  Definitely one book I recommend to everyone who would like to be a little better himself  This book is a must read for everyone especially those who are in roles of leadership  There is a time and place for everything  Just because you are right  you still might be wrong    Read this book  Very enlightening  Shows specific things to be nice to people and have them like you back  Also attributes you need to be a successful leader  A great book that helps the reader understand key actions to connect  understand and influence people  The important thing to remember throughout this book however  is that our intentions and actions should be genuine  Without that  we run the risk of being seen as a manipulator and lose sight of the entire purpose of speaking with people and motivating action I also enjoyed reading this book because it presented information through the actions of different characters we have all heard about  such as the past US presidents  inventors  philosophers etc  Dale Carnegie has done a great job in writing this book  since I have found some of the methods mentioned to be effective in my daily life  The title might be somewhat off putting  and some of my friends were confused  saying  but you HAVE friends   But the book is full of insights concerning relationships and human engineering  all backed by good examples  and gave me a much better perspective on how to handle important interactions  It s mainly applicable in a professional field  business relationships   but can also be good for relationships with family and friends  I think  taken with a grain of salt  I d probably recommend this to anyone   this book is interesting for anyone who learn about skill with peoplethe way to tell us by people s story Great book  terrible title The title of this book seems to imply that this book will teach you how to manipulate people into doing what you want  What it really discusses is how to conduct meaningful interactions with others  by treating others with the same integrity and respect that we all would like in return  It is the mother of all self help books and you will find that Covey echos many of the concepts discussed in this book  A well written book with great examples of men in the past  This book should be read by all the mangers because it does tell how bad a manager can get if you don t follow some of the basic principles in life of smiling and listening  Recommended for all ages  Don t be a talker and if you want to be one then make sure the other person is a good listener     I listened to the audio version  which made the book seem reaaaaaaaaaaallllllllllllly slow  but not boring  Most of the book was examples of how Dale s approach works  and how to get what you want while not making the other person feel slighted Like most old books  I had to force myself to not roll my eyes at the cliched mentions  knowing that this book IS the original Certainly a worthy read  if only to remind you to slow the hell down and think about how you re treating people  The author has a great understanding about human nature  He help us to understand how to dealing with people and make them important and feel appreciated  He also help us to handling with other without making them manipulated  These book is rich of relationship solution   Great  great book  The concepts can be applied to parenting  teaching  business  basically anywhere in life  I think this should be required reading in college  It s just the basics of how to work with people   we forget how important the little things are  A well written book  Enjoyed reading it    Very interesting stuff  Although this book has a lot of common sense in it  it support its points with anecdotal evidence that comes across as being genuine  The mix of lesson and story made it very effective in showing how to implant the discussed techniques  I enjoyed it and was glad to have read it   Great practical guidelines for each of us in developing human relations  A classic book that has already made its mark  But for the modern day  How to Talk to Anyone by Leil Lowndes is a formidable supplement  Fabulous book that made me realize everything I did wrong with my relationships  especially in graduate school  But there were a few affirming moments when I realized what I have been doing well in my life  This book is geared for those in business but everyone should read it  as it is about basic principles of human interaction  Up sides are that it is pro human relations and makes you want to improve yourself  It also has tons of historical and interesting stories  Down side is the obviously sexist time it was printed and many statements are offensive to modern women   It was a fun book to read  Most of what is written in it is common sense  but it nice to have someone point it out to you with a story to remember it  What s actually totally awesome  is that the book is so old that a lot of examples are old gangsters and mafiosos  Everything is awesome    I had the pleasure of listening to How to Win Friends as an audiobook on my commute to work  It s a classic for a reason   full of common sense advice  the type we re prone to forget  and charming anecdotes from the early 20th century that fortunately have never been updated  providing a very interesting view into the professional and personal lives of folks in the 1920s and 1930s  The principles in the book  like most good advice  are easy to understand but harder to enact consistently  I found myself wanting to strive for them  though   and that made this book worth it for me  I read this book while waiting in a really long line at the DMV more than a decade ago  Although I didn t really learn anything new because most of the stuff that Dale Carnegie brings up on here have already been pretty much taught to me by my wiser elders while growing up  I still value this book and give a copy of it as a gift every now and then  especially to those who seem to need it One of the best parts that I remember from this book is the following passage   If some people are so hungry for a feeling of importance that they eventually go insane to get it  imagine what miracle you and I can achieve by giving people honest appreciation this side of insanity  I couldn t have said it better myself  This was a really good book  The information in it is practical and simple  A lot of self help self improvement texts seem to be a little  preachy  and superior  this isn t This is a worthwhile read for anyone interested in improving their interpersonal skills and understanding of social dynamics  This is a starter  Don t settle on this book  Also  it s often misunderstood by young minds   From when I heard about this book  I felt as if it was necessary for me to read  for future experience  and as I started reading it  I learned many ways to gain friends and repect from others  Although  the ways are not only listed  but are proved by quotes  the author s experience  and real historical events   After you read this book  you get more cautious of your actions  and you also are able to catch a mistake you might do before even doing it  which  obviously will make you a better person  and improve your manners   The reason for giving it a four star rating is that it made me feel like reading a history book  which of course isn t that exciting  The writer proves his point in many ways when only one can be sufficient for the readers to agreewith his objective  but other than that  I find this book a great key for improving yourself  as it gives you amazing techniques in handling people  and others for making people like you  I think that the techniques and advices given  are everlasting  because this book covers human nature  Also  some proof for this point of view is that the author mentioned many historical events where these suggestions were applied  and are still affectionated at the time  Absolutely fantastic read This book covers basic principles in human relations and how to apply them to everyday life  I found this book not only inspiring but easy to follow and implement changes in the way I relate to people I meet everyday  I can see why this has remained such a timeless classic in everything from business to sales  The concepts are all rather simple  but the author  through each revision  manages to present such a crackling  quick moving lesson that one if forced to agree and attempt to change accordingly   return  return I read this again in conjunction with the Carnegie Immersion course  Anyone would benefit from both  There are a lot of fine take aways I could cite here but the main point is probably to practice it  I wish I had read this when I was 15 instead of 33  Time will tell if it helps me any  but I believe with conscious effort  the lessons in this timeless classic will ultimately be to my advantage as an adult  We ll see    Apparently I ve been taught most of these principles thorughout my life   they all seemed like common sense to me and things that I thought all people already knew  That s not to say that I m doing all of these things or that I m great at some of these things  but they are certainly things that I ve been taught and strived for my entire life  I d like to get an actual copy of this book as I was just listening the audio version and so it would be good to be able to mark parts of this up and review it in more depth  A classic  I read it in junior high and picked it up again a few years ago  It is a classic and one that I read again from time to time  Dale Carnegie was alive nearly 3 generation before me   but his writings follow the world order forever    Chock full of stuff I highlighted  this was an easy  interesting read  Just like any other  social psych  book  many of the principles lessons are obvious but it s not till you see it on paper that you realise it s something that you should be doing because it makes so much sense I wish I had read it earlier  Who knows how useful it would have been in   life  Haha  But anyways  better late than never and I m glad to have read it only now because then I can match it to the people and examples I see at work  There is more context and I better appreciate the examples he has listed  In any case  it s one of those books worth a re read every once in a while  This book is good because it gives clear frameworks to follow in good times and in bad when dealing with people  It isn t just theoretical  The stories are great as well   It gives you the right advice  It s just how the advice is put into action   link to original postThis book has been popular for a long while now  And because it is so well written  I gave it 2 out of 5 stars  My problem is that everything in this book is pretty much common sense  and  if anything  I was saddened that society needs self improvement books like this in the first place  In all honesty  if you think you need this book  what you really need is a kick in the behind and a reality check  Look inside yourself and you ca save money on buying this book  Such a disappointment as I heard so many great things about this book   Great to finally finish this book  Although quite a few of the stories are dated  this book is full of sound advice  None of the concepts were completely new to me but the anecdotal examples were very beneficial to see how the concepts were put to use in real life scenarios  I felt some of the material was dated since it was written in the 30s but many of the principles still apply today  I would love to read an updated version of the book that takes into account technology  the credit card culture  online dating and social media  I also hated how simplistic and naive the section on mental illness was and would be fine if they deleted that section  Overall it was a very good book with good tips and techniques for how to present yourself and converse well with others  This book describes how to communicate effectively  The methods described are useful and will surely get you benefits It actually provokes you to think before speaking  In my opinion if you approach these methods eventually you will reap the benefits  You should read it once for sure  Very implementable in daily lifes A book everyone should not only read  but implement into their lives   Easy and entertaining read with lots if value  Looking forward to reviewing it periodically going forward  As a matter of fact i think its a very good one  But i think it was more useful in the past than now  People has changed now  A worthy book to read though  seandainya aq menguasai 60  saja dari buku ini  huhuhuhu    I am really  really anti self help books  but when I was out of things to read  I found this on a shelf at home  and thought  ah  let s see what these self righteous people have to say   But when I read it  I really liked it  On the most part  I can say it was intuitive to me  because I ve always had a sense of self when dealing with others  But the book helps point out dealing with people skills in a very well organized manner  and through very interesting historical anecdotes  It s a great feel for social skills and I thoroughly enjoyed it   It has been awhile since I read this book but it was good  Don t be put off by the slightly Machiavellian title  This book is about making the most of your interactions with others  It has lots of great tips about dealing with complaints  handling arguments and the best way to give somebody criticism  Mommy made me read this when I was really young  primary school I think  evident lack of tactfulness on my side maybe  haha   Anyway this is one of the non fiction staples  It is very to the point  convincing and effective  Brilliant Carnegie eloquently and vividly shows us how flawed we are as humans  but also shines a direct spotlight on how easily rectifiable our imperfections can be  Though his examples verge towards unrealistic fiction at times  he shows his true skills as a storyteller when sharing these small anecdotes with us   How to Win Friends and Influence People  is an easy read which should be considered by all   businessperson or not   as there s great value in learning how to be kind  genuine  empathetic human beings  Nice read  useful stuff  clear  precise presentation  I felt so strongly that everyone should read this book that I let a friend    ex work husband Tim    borrow this book  Yeah  he never returned it  It s a quick read  The book tells you how to correct things that the most of the people are exercising   A well written book  Enjoyed reading it    I picked this up 20 years ago and I still read it every year  time to buy a copy  The zest you need  when feeling tired  old  stale and in need of a boost  A should read book on improving your business communication skills  Following the instructions in the on how to get the most out of this book  I read each chapter then re read it before proceeding  I was also attending an NLP Practitioner s Course  reading the chapters on the bus to and from the venue  It is surprising how much the learnings of each overlapped Yet what surprised me more was the examples of people who knew these principles yet failed to stick with them So I became more acutely aware of my own need to practice the examples given in this book if I was to really benefit from it and build up my own consistency In some ways it is remarkable that one book could contain so much and yet people write their own lesser versions  However  I now realize this is their own practice  in the world  of the principles put forth by Dale Carnegie  Rather than write a whole book  we tend now to write a variety of articles which play out the principles in different situations  Some people then gather them together into a book  But essentially Dale Carnegie s version differs because it was his own central storage of his own learning and practice  He constantly revised and improved it and kept it as a live project  rather than a completed collection This approach is that of the Mechanic profile in Talent Dynamics  Beginning with a systematic approach to situations and constantly revising and improving them  Even though Carnegie was dealing with people  he was doing so with a very deliberate task and purpose in mind  His teaching of people was almost a secondary benefit in his own mind to the system he was developing for himself to improve his own skills  The people he taught were part of his feedback to test his own competency It is the level to which Dale Carnegie took these practices and applied them which has made his book such a classic for anyone to learn from over time  Read the more modern versions  but go back to this master as well   Common sense advice from the pioneer of self help  I would recommend to anyone  I am re reading this  Basically  a good read  and with the over lying message that you need to pay attention to others emotional needs  be interested in them  and that will lead them to have positive feelings towards you  Not revelationary but it s a good dig in the ribs that we must take time to listen and take genuine interest in others  My dad recommended this book  I was skeptical at first and read it halfheartedly  But then  I stumbled upon a line I read in this book   I had the blues because I had no shoes until upon the street  I met a man who had no feet   Then I was hooked  Nuff said  Another great motivational book   Beeing in Business this book really spoke to me about customer service and like the Title sais influence people   A book that changed the way I interpreted life  This book is a great reminder on how we should act  The whole book can basically be summarised as  be nice to other people and try to put yourself in their shoes   It was first published in 1936 but  most of it  is still very relevant today  There were some good examples of the techniques working and I believe the world would be a better place if people took the advice The final section on marriage advice was probably relevant to the time  but now appears very dated  It assumes that men and women have pre defined roles where men go out and work whilst women stay home and cook and clean  His advice is still good  but the gender components should be ignored  as it goes both ways This book is a good reminder as to how to behave  However  if you re using it as steps to get your own way then it won t work and you ve completely missed the point  It is all about sincerity  Carnegie points this out in the final line of the Letters section when he states   the principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the heart  I am not advocating a bag of tricks  I am talking about a new way of life   ktb mmtz    wnjm  n drst wkhbrt wmshhdt Sdq  wwq y wblf l    bmjrd qrth wjdt nfsy  Tbq  w  l  l ql  qrn w lHZ m qr th fy lktb  l  lwq

put the fragments together  I realized how my manager used all these tactics adroitly  This stuff is proven  A well written book  Enjoyed reading it    There is a reason that this book has been so well known for so many years  I learned many things regarding interacting with people  I learned about how to develop relationships with people as well as some of the common pitfalls to avoid that can destroy those relationships  The book I have is not on Good Reads  I have a 1967 edition  Very sweet book  I loved it    This is a must have on the bookshelf  I find it a bit much to read in one hit It is one of those books you read as you need to read it   that way it sinks in better and works for what you need now  One of the original self help books Great at the time  much better books out now  I really enjoyed this book  As usual Mr Carnegie using great tone and amazing analogies to get their point across  This book is not about getting friends  It s about understanding the different personalities and thought processes of the people around you Great read   It s a great book and classic for personal communication  It does get a bit too repetitive toward the second half and it seems there was pressure to have a certain number of chapters because later in the book many chapters are only a few pages and some only 1 page  very important to read  A lot of this book seems like common sense  but it is an excellent manual for managing and dealing with people  It s an easy read  and I will plan on reading it again   Awesome     In this book the author illustrates different principles which can help to improve and be a better person  citing examples of many great people in history  The book is slow but the author has done a great job in expressing his ideas One of the quote which I will always remember is  Judge not  that ye be not judged   We live in a hasty society where we do not really listen to each other anymore  We tend to bluff and only show our superficial facade that we generated throughout the years  In negotiations we want to win whatever is at stake and in times of social networking we know more people than ever before but paradoxically we are growing more socially isolated  With this book Dale Carnegie shows us that we need to connect more to one another  He displays all the essential social skills to establish and cement good relationships  whether they are private or professional  Friendliness  listening  empathy  constructive feedback and smiling are just a few of his tips and tricks to win friends and influence people  So if you would like to read the nice stories that he uses to clarify his theory and you would like to upgrade your people skills that will make you stand out even more in a crowd  I am glad to recommend you this book   Great book about interacting with people  i thought it would be about manipulation  and was wary  but it turned out to be great  This book was a fairly interesting read  albeit a little conflictive for my inner peace  On the one hand  I think a lot of tips suggested make a superficial person  They stray away from the natural response to situations of a person  to a place eerily close to what we call a people pleaser  On the other hand  it mentions time and again to be sincere and honest with how we deal with people  or else to risk being tagged as pretentious  I guess it all depends in what way one utilises the tips mentioned in the book  One needs to be cautious and careful with this book  Also  I recommend leaving out close friends and relatives with the methods of handling people mentioned in this book  unless absolutely necessary  You ll know you have a great friend if you never need to consult this book because of them  When I saw this book title in my senior book shelf  I felt the content of the book would be flattering  When I read this book recently I felt regret for having bad feeling in the past  Dale explained how to deal each and every aspect of life which we don t even know how it effects  No matter what profession is  you always so many principles in this book which you can apply to any situation in your life  It took me about 7 months to get through this book  This is not one you read over a weekend for something to do  It is very poignant and if you apply the lessons learned they will take you a long way  I am also partial to such methods as the Sandler system  but this looks at influence and leadership in a slightly different way and is just as valid  This is a book you take notes with  highlight passages  underline paragraphs  mark up   it should look like a school textbook when you are done with it  Although it was written some 80 years ago  the lessons to be learned form this are timeless  Believe the hype  This book is great  A lot of people seem to think that this book teaches you how to manipulate people  but if they think that they probably haven t read it  One of the key points of the book is that none of these strategies will work unless you genuinely care about other people  and you want what s best for them  If you have only your best interests in mind  then almost everyone will sense you are insincere and you will fail to achieve genuine influence on all but the most desperate people  A classic  Although some of the terminology is a little outdated  Like other reviewers  I was surprised to find that I liked this book more than I expected  While it might not be the biggest page turner ever written  many of the anecdotal examples are amusing and I think the advice could help people  ktb jyd wy   jd    wl lh mn jwd ktb ltnmy  lbshry  khSwS nh qll mn mnqsh  ms l  lml    lty shthrt bh ktb ltnmy  lbshry  This book was suggested as a book club pick several years ago  We didn t end up reading it but it pique my interest  Which is one thing I love about book clubs  I m pretty sure I would never of picked this book up on my own since I thought the title sounded manipulative  But for the most part it wasn t and I really enjoyed this book  I discovered and started applying  sometimes rediscovered and reasserted efforts to apply  many true principles about how to get along with others mostly based on things like being considerate  respectful  kind  a good listener etc    Don t we all need to be better at those kind of things  Wouldn t the world be better if we each actually took some conscientious effort to be better at those kind of things  So another example of don t judge a book by it s cover  or title in this case    Solid book with good skills to remember  Anecdotes were easy to follow but eventually realized the ENTIRE book is a book of anecdotes with very little other research  Still  a good classic that has solid information  Great  timeless advice  with the exception of certain antiquated gender stereotyping in the last chapter   But  hey  for 1936  it isn t that bad   good book a little outdated  but still works This was a hard one to rate  It is full of useful and helfpul information and good stories  but it s also repetitive and a little dated  In fact  I had no idea it was written in the 1930 s  I knew it had been around for a long while  but not that long  I m glad I finally read it  Dale Carnegie s famous  How To Win Friends and Influence People  also known as  The big secret to dealing with people   is an eye opening book  Before reading this book  you would think you ve been doing almost everything perfectly when it comes to handling people  It ll make you think carefully about your actions and make you more self conscious about what you say and how you treat other people  The purpose of this book is to help people maneuver their way through their different relationships  along with all of the people you come into contact with in a productive way  The book will make you think more about the other person s perspective whenever you disagree with them  If you re really genuine about learning how to deal with others  you ll catch yourself being more aware of how you interact with people  Carnegie mentions that   He who can do this has the world with him  He who cannot  walks a lonely way   he is saying that if you can master the tips given to make people like you  winning people to your way of thinking and being a leader  you will have people in the palm of your hands Carnegie showed no signs of favoritism and was fair throughout the whole book  He considered all point of views a person could possibly have in the different situations addressed in the book  He showed the adverse and typical ways of dealing with situations followed by a positive way to go about things in situations  which ties into one of the many lesson s Carnegie touched on  don t criticize  condemn  or complain  Carnegie says   Instead of condemning people  let s try to understand them  Try to figure out why they do what they do   This breeds sympathy  tolerance and kindness   this quote is declaring is that people are going to do things that you don t agree with  however you should always try to look at things from their point of view instead of being quick to judge or belittle  He gives an example from the life of Abraham Lincoln  Abraham Lincoln wrote an insulting letter in his town s newspaper about another politician  Soon after  the politician found out Lincoln wrote the letter and challenged him to fight in the duel  Luckily  the duel was interrupted and stopped  After that incident  Lincoln never again wrote an insulting letter and he almost never criticized anybody for anything Overall  the book was well written and organized  Carnegies  points were straightforward and comprehensive  The points were simple and apparent  yet significant and commonly neglected  He also elaborated on each point and gave specific examples for each  For example  one of the points in the book was to be a good listener and encourage others to talk about themselves  That sounds simple  but people sometimes fail to realize how quick they are to talk about themselves while interacting with others  He also gave examples from the lives of well  known people  which made the book seem more realistic and relatable Dale Carnegie wrote this book to help people become better at dealing with all types of people and looking at situations from the other person s point of view  Through the story  he helps the readers to take a second look at how they treat people  and gives them helpful tips on how to improve their relationships with them  The book shares very good insight into what should be done to build good relationship with people  2 disadvantages which I did not enjoy  1  real life examples of old times   you cannot change it  as the book was written 80 years ago  2  high number of examples to prove the recommendation   I had to skip most of them as they were keeping from reading the book at pace  A lot of it seems pretty common sense  but its filled with a lot of anecdotes and other examples that really flesh out the advice and make it insightful  I highlighted the heck out of it and i got yellow sticky tabs throughout the entire book  so hopefully I will someday put some of what I learned to good use  If you re at all interested in this sort of book  then it s probably a good find and will certainly help you    To be interesting  be interested  The book I read was the revised 80s version  I didn t know this until I started the book and then I didn t want to change  Usually  I hate when books are updated  Leave it alone  If you think you have a lot of new ideas  just write a new book  Because between revising the book in the 80s and when it was originally written  it was 50 years  given that the book was written in the 30s  And I wanted to read the original original version  A person s toothache means more to that person than a famine in China which kills a million people  A boil on one s neck interests one more than forty earthquakes in Africa  Think of that the next time you start a conversation  Because the book  in what appears one of the first self help book  in the sense of what we know today   is actually great  It is simple  basic  and true  and after 80 years  not much has been improved on  except today s books make the author seem like some sort of douche  No how idea how current authors do that  but they all write self help books that seem to have huge subtitles under each page that says   I AM A DOUCHE   But this book doesn t have that  Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right  Even killing the dog would not cure the bite  I wouldn t mind rereading the original book again  When reading it  at first I thought  I know all this  but after a while  I thought  I m not really applying it as much as I want to  A good reminder on what parts I can use  Of course  no book is a blueprint and this one shouldn t be either  I read reviews on this book from people who claimed it will turn you into a doormat  I think that s where one has to be intelligent in reading self help books  One uses the parts that one finds weakness in one s natural personality  at the same time  building on one s own unique skillset And finally  some choice quotes from the book  These are not from the author  but quotes he uses from other famous people  so credit to his choice of quotes  not to his quotes Publilius Syrus   We are interested in others when they are interested in us   Emerson   Every man I meet is my superior in some way  In that  I learn of him   Disraeli   Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours   Galileo   You cannot teach a man anything  you can only help him to find it within   Lord Chesterfield  to his son    Be wiser than other people if you can  but do not tell them so    In a similar way  General Robert E  Lee once spoke to the president of the Confederacy  Jefferson Davis  in the most glowing terms about a certain officer under his command  Another officer in attendance was astonished   General   he said    do you not know that the man of whom you speak so highly is one of your bitterest enemies who misses no opportunity to malign you    Yes   replied General Lee   but the president asked my opinion of him  he did not ask for his opinion of me     By the way  I am not revealing anything new in this chapter  Two thousand years ago  Jesus said   Agree with thine adversary quickly     And 2 200 years before Christ was born  King Akhtoi of Egypt gave his son some shrewd advice   advice that is sorely needed today   Be diplomatic   counseled the King   It will help you gain your point     The Chinese have a proverb pregnant with the age old wisdom of the Orient   He who treads softly goes far    Great info  A classic in human relationships  Learnt a fair bit  hope it stays with me  The tips in this book are timeless  The style of speech and the examples  however  were not and might sound a little stilted to our 21st century ears  I would still encourage everyone to read it Carnegie starts from first impressions and goes all the way through leadership  He explains how to get people to like you and how to get people to do what you need them to do  What he says here is still highly applicable to today s world  amazing  considered this was written in 1936  This is the classic business book for soft skills  and you can see how so many books that came after it can be seen as a variation on Carnegie s original themes  A must read for those who like business non fiction  I did get the distinct impression that this might just be a long advertisement for the Carnegie classes  but that s all right  Carnegie s book is pretty good advice if you want to work in business  especially in sales  as well as in other workplaces  The title for the book about  friends  could be misleading for some people though as it is not really about making friends socially  2nd time through it  Lots of good nuggets   I should have read this book way earlier  as one thing is sure   it certainly made me will make me a better person The title is somewhat pretentious  but don t get fooled by it  The book is all about dealing with people in a good way  Treating them good and being full of understanding  no matter the situation  They will be happy and you will more likely benefit from it I was not fond of the examples supporting his arguments  and on times  there were just so many of them  but other than that this book seemed like a helpful  manual   Being a good communicator is never out of date  I hope applying some of the advice  I will generally improve my communication skills and then start building my own success stories  It was one of my pre critical thinking books  It was a good read back then but I don t think I would be able to read it now  I read this book in 1998 with a group from work  We would read a chapter a week  then watch part of a video series  All of us got promotions that year   Greer classic  it becomes a bit redundant at one points but the message is clear and effective  Excellent points in this book about how to manage people and your own manners  Get ready to be genuinely interested in other people  to put on good manners and to set down your own ego to make others feel special  Get ready to learn how to ignore the need for credibility and achieve progress instead by letting others get the ideas This book will teach you to give space for others to become your friends and will encourage you to think in terms of other people s interests  There are also a LOT of interesting anecdotal stories  but you don t necessarily need to read all of them One note  This is an old book and so has some pretty sexist statements for today s time about marriage  It assumes women are nagging  and gives no example of men nagging  and so adresses its chapter  don t nag  entirely to women  and also writes as though intellectual achievements are solely a male need   In my short life I ve definitely experienced nagging men  Probably more nagging women than men  but it s not as black and white as he portrays   He even encourages women to lay down their own need to excel to stroke their husband s ego because he needs a calm house to come home to after a long day at work Obviously we re a lot more diverse in our thinking today  know that both men and women have a need to excel and have their egos stroked Ignoring that one chapter  which  in spite of a little bit of sexism  was still right that nagging is bad  this is an excellent book  mn lktb lly b tbrh rsy l

this book and was only a little disappointed  The entirety of the book can more or less be summed up in the words  be selfless  and mindful of others   Many of the  principles  were variations on a theme instead of being distinct leadership principles  All told  it is still a must for the readers of leadership management genre  One of those classics I ve always heard about and wanted to read  Sometimes these types of books can get a little boring  but Carnegie uses plenty of examples and interesting stories to keep you interested  Very insightful  still applicable today This is a handbook about human relations Each chapter explains a fundamental principle for building and maintaining a good relationship with others  Carnegie uses a great deal of short stories of successful people to illustrate these principles to show how they really work  I found many of the stories really inspiring  but some of them didn t seem very relevant A lot of the principles in this book are principles we already know or have heard of  Honestly  I was hoping to read about techniques I ve never heard of  but I felt like I was reading the obvious On the other hand  it was silly of me not to expect  the obvious   We all already have an idea of what makes good and bad relationships  isn t it common sense  However  we often miss to see the obvious clearly  we don t give it too much thought  and we often forget to apply these obvious principles when the time comes to deal with people  Carnegie tries to make us see these principles in a clearer way and also the benefits their application can bring us While some people might find some of the techniques manipulative or only helpful to build fake relationships based on personal interests  I shall argue that Carnegie emphasizes many times the sincerity one should have while putting those techniques into action  And truth is all relationships are based on some sort of interest  This book  more than anything  tries to form good habits in us and it serves as a reminder of how to deal with people in a successful way  You definitely won t be wasting your time if you choose to read it  A book with contents both illuminating and comically obvious in hindsight  Despite its unfortunate marketable title  which suggests a duplicity that is the antithesis of the authors intent  this collection of personal and historical antidotes is a remarkably interesting book which ought to be requisite reading for any human being who plans on existing on a planet with other human beings  That s most of you  The book sums to the golden rule  However  if one would do unto others as he would want to have done to himself  it is important to know oneself  what one would want  and  by easy generalization  human nature in general  In this dual way  Carnegie informs us not only about others but about ourselves  Classic  This is a very old book  but several of the tips contained in this book are very relevant even in today s world This can help improving relationships  communication with colleagues and reduce friction arising from ego clashes at workplace  This should be taught in schools  Great resource for all in learning how to interact with other people My version was a little older  but it provided many good tips on the art of communication  Planning to reread It in English due to work reason   This is a book that you can t simply read and then put down to never revisit  It is like the Art of War  you need to think about the ideas and how they could be applied and attempt to apply them  Sometimes the lessons are hidden in the subtext and at least for someone like me  it was difficult to parse out the meanings or what I was supposed to take from each chapter It isn t that the book is obtuse  I think many normal people could take a lot out of it  I think people like me should study it and use it as a bible for how to interact with people  Treating people with respect should be simple  but the means and reasons are not  Interacting with people is often complex and while some people have an innate ability and charisma when interacting with people  Others are not so blessed The concept described in the book should be simple  but reads like the Design of Things  The purpose is to go through what I ll describe as scenarios or examples where the concepts are applied and discussed  It is more like a workshop or classroom  If there was a teacher then the person would have given some idea as to the message of each chapter  You could or should come to some conclusion by thinking about each chapter  It is part of the reason that it is a book that may need to be reread time and time again It is part of a collection on how to not be an asshole and how to handle people  People are complex or at least appear complex  Part of that is that the motivations are often not clear and this book serves to provide some clarity to what those motivations are  This book is one of those books that everyone should have a copy of  The content may seem little repeating and obvious to some people  but I found this book to be a great piece to read  Transformative book  If you seek self improvement  shorten your want to read list and check out this classic first  I avoided it for over a decade  despite having majored in psychology  because I interpreted the title as suggesting it was a how to on manipulating others and being false in the corporate world  But it is far from this  It teaches you to always put others first and effect change in others by first changing how you approach others  with humility  respect and close listening  and then guiding them to want to change to benefit themselves  This approach has been restated countless times in modern self help books on marriage  parenting  business success  and negotiation  and is rooted in psychology research  spiritual teaching and the lives of great leaders  But instead of being lecturing and admonishing  Carnegie engages you with true stories that show the inspiration for and application of his techniques  And he puts you at ease by pointing out how far he has come from his early years  giving hope to even the most awkward or ill spoken  Dale Carnegie might not seem the most compelling life coach for readers in a digital age  but his lessons  gathered from centuries of others  learning  prove to be surprisingly relevant and enduring  It s also interesting to learn the back stories of corporate titans and US presidents  humanizing them and putting their later successes in context  The lessons may be repetitive in the middle third of the book  but press on to the final section  where Carnegie teaches you how to deal with conflict  It s an issue I ve long struggled with  but find much more easy to remedy than I d ever imagined  It is possible to learn tact and diplomacy  well  I m trying   This was a revelation to me  she with foot in mouth   A breezy and useful book on improving human relationships  I think this book should be required reading for the U S  Congress  The book is packed with anecdotes about famous and not so famous people  e g   folks that took Carnegie s course  that illustrate how to make people like you  win them over to your way of thinking  and change them without arousing resentment  The tips are variations on these fundamental principles  which are themselves an expansion of the Golden Rule  keeping in mind that everyone wants to feel important  1  Don t criticise  condemn  or complain 2  Give honest and sincere appreciation 3  Arouse an eager want in the other person    How to Win Friends   Influence People  is an insightful  practical  effective and enjoyable book that  I believe  can make a positive impact in everyone s daily life  Though all of the principles suggested in this book appear overly simplistic  in practice  it can be quite a challenge  as it is not the norm  in my opinion   I would recommend this book to anyone that has tried to change to their situation at work  at home  anywhere  with anyone and not been successful  The principles suggested in this book might be a refreshing change and ultimately  get you what you want   Classic book that everyone should read  Really good reminders about how to treat people  Carnegie describes most of  winning friends and influencing people  as treating them with kindness  respect and dignity  All the examples were so dated  the book was originally written in 1936  but that almost made the overarching principles ring more true Favorite quotations  Even in such technical lines as engineering  about 15 percent of one s financial success is due to one s technical knowledge and about 85 percent is due to skill in human engineering  to personality and the ability to lead people  I believe it  The great aim of education   said Herbert Spencer   is not knowledge but action  On the futility of criticism  Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself  Criticism is dangerous  because it wounds a person s precious pride  hurts his sense of importance  and arouses resentment   Criticisms are like homing pigeons  They always return home  Let s realize that the person we are going to correct and condemn will probably justify himself or herself  and condemn us in return  Lincoln on criticism  One of his favorite quotations was  Judge not  that ye be not judged   And when Mrs  Lincoln and others spoke harshly of the southern people  Lincoln replied   Don t criticize them  they are just what we would be under similar circumstances   Benjamin Franklin  tactless in his youth  became so diplomatic  so adroit at handling people  that he was made American Ambassador to France  The secret of his success   I will speak ill of no man   he said         and speak all the good I know of everybody   Any fool can criticize  condemn and complain  and most fools do  But it takes character and self control to be understanding and forgiving  On getting people to do what you want  There is only one way under high heaven to get anybody to do anything  Did you ever stop to think of that  Yes  just one way  And that is by making the other person want to do it  Remember  there is no other way   I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people   said Schwab   the greatest asset I possess  and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement   There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors  I never criticize anyone  I believe in giving a person incentive to work  So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault  If I like anything  I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise  In my wide association in life  meeting with many and great people in various parts of the world   Schwab declared   I have yet to find the person  however great or exalted his station  who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than he would ever do under a spirit of criticism   Tomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something  Before you speak  pause and ask yourself   How can I make this person want to do it   If out of reading this book you get just one thing  an increased tendency to think always in terms of other people s point of view  and see things from their angle  if you get that one thing out of this book  it may easily prove to be one of the building blocks of your career  On making friends  If we want to make friends  let s put ourselves out to do things for other people  things that require time  energy  unselfishness and thoughtfulness      People rarely succeed at anything unless they have fun doing it  Importance of names  We should be aware of the magic contained in a name and realize that this single item is wholly and completely owned by the person with whom we are dealing       and nobody else  The name sets the individual apart  it makes him or her unique among all others  The information we are imparting or the request we are making takes on a special importance when we approach the situation with the name of the individual  From the waitress to the senior executive  the name will work magic as we deal with others Having good conversations  So if you aspire to be a good conversationalist  be an attentive listener  To be interesting  be interested  Ask questions that other persons will enjoy answering  Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments  Remember that the people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems   There is one all important law of human conduct  If we obey that law  we shall almost never get into trouble  In fact  that law  if obeyed  will bring us countless friends and constant happiness  But the very instant we break the law  we shall get into endless trouble  The law is this  Always make the other person feel important  John Dewey  as we have already noted  said that the desire to be important is the deepest urge in human nature  and William James said   The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated   As I have already pointed out  it is this urge that differentiates us from the animals  It is this urge that has been responsible for civilization itself   The unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some way  and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize their importance  and recognize it sincerely  Remember what Emerson said   Every man I meet is my superior in some way  In that  I learn of him  On changing minds  If a person makes a statement that you think is wrong  yes  even that you know is wrong  isn t it better to begin by saying   Well  now  look  I thought otherwise  but I may be wrong  I frequently am  And if I am wrong  I want to be put right  Let s examine the facts   There s magic  positive magic  in such phrases as   I may be wrong  I frequently am  Let s examine the facts   We sometimes find ourselves changing our minds without any resistance or heavy emotion  but if we are told we are wrong  we resent the imputation and harden our hearts  We are incredibly heedless in the formation of our beliefs  but find ourselves filled with an illicit passion for them when anyone proposes to rob us of their companionship  It is obviously not the ideas themselves that are dear to us  but our self esteem which is threatened        The little word  my  is the most important one in human affairs  and properly to reckon with it is the beginning of wisdom  It has the same force whether it is  my  dinner   my  dog  and  my  house  or  my  father   my  country  and  my  God   Any fool can try to defend his or her mistakes  and most fools do  but it raises one above the herd and gives one a feeling of nobility and exultation to admit one s mistakes   When we are right  let s try to win people gently and tactfully to our way of thinking  and when we are wrong  and that will be surprisingly often  if we are honest with ourselves  let s admit our mistakes quickly and with enthusiasm  Not only will that technique produce astonishing results  but  believe it or not  it is a lot more fun  under the circumstances  than trying to defend oneself  Remember the old proverb   By fighting you never get enough  but by yielding you get more than you expected   In talking with people  don t begin by discussing the things on which you differ  Begin by emphasizing  and keep on emphasizing  the things on which you agree  Keep emphasizing  if possible  that you are both striving for the same end and that your only difference is one of method and not of purpose  Get the other person saying  Yes  yes  at the outset  Keep your opponent  if possible  from saying  No   Wouldn t you like to have a magic phrase that would stop arguments  eliminate ill feeling  create good will  and make the other person listen attentively  Yes  All right  Here it is   I don t blame you one iota for feeling as you do  If I were you I would undoubtedly feel just as you do  On sympathy  Dr  Arthur I  Gates said in his splendid book Educational Psychology   Sympathy the human species universally craves  The child eagerly displays his injury  or even inflicts a cut or bruise in order to reap abundant sympathy  For the same purpose adults       show their bruises  relate their accidents  illness  especially details of surgical operations   Self pity  for misfortunes real or imaginary is  in some measure  practically a universal practice  On showmanship  This is the day of dramatization  Merely stating a truth isn t enough  The truth has to be made vivid  interesting  dramatic  You have to use showmanship  The movies do it  Television does it  And you will have to do it if you want attention  And this was 1936  It is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our good points   Asking questions not only makes an order more palatable  it often stimulates the creativity of the persons whom you ask  People are more likely to accept an order if they have had a part in the decision that caused the order to be issued   Let us praise even the slightest improvement  That inspires the other person to keep on improving    Praise is like sunlight to the warm human spirit  we cannot flower and grow without it  And yet  while most of us are only too ready to apply to others the cold wind of criticism  we are somehow reluctant to give our fellow the warm sunshine of praise   one of the important rules of human relations  Always make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest  FUNDAMENTAL TECHNIQUES IN HANDLING PEOPLEPRINCIPLE 1Don t criticize  condemn or complain  PRINCIPLE 2 Give honest and sincere

The influence is not malicious that Carnegie speaks of  but more of a working influence  I can see how these skills can work in many relationships instead of being combative  A surprisingly relevant book considering that it s 75 years old or whatever  Still plenty to learn  and a testament that human behavior doesn t change all that much over time   I m giving this four stars instead of 3 because I feel there are some good nuggets in there  However  I feel the book dragged on too much   A well written book  Enjoyed reading it    A must read for every human being who ever has to get a job or make any money  Timeless classic which is not as sordid as the title make it sound  Indispensable reading for anyone trying to improve their interpersonal skills   Lovely writing style  and the examples and illustrations show just how timeless this subject matter is  Usually every good business book is also a good book on parenting  With that said  this is a great book on parenting    And business  marriage  church  and really any situation that involves interaction with other living creatures  It s nothing revolutionary in what it says  but it gives you subtle reminders to do the things you know you should be doing  I will criticize less  praise others more  empathize better  and respond with more tact after reading this book for the now second time through  It fits perfectly in the theme of books I ve been reading lately which is social psychology   Great  This is the classic  and I finally got around to reading it  Good  down to earth advice  and helped along by some great stories  Easy to read and not to be missed  It s a must read for some one looking to improve how to deal with people  Some examples on the book are exaggerated and does not sounds that real  This is a great read and probably a should read for most professionals  At the advice of my grandfather  a must read for everyone involved with people   There is no denying that the book contains truly remarkable advice which could not only help people to make friends and influence people  but also to make this a better place  But throughout the book  too much words and arguments are wasted on explaining specific ideas  I have always liked Dale Carnegie s material  This one makes sense  Most people probably know most of the this stuff but just forget to use it  It s mostly about listening and respecting other people and show them you are truely interested in them  and not nodding just to  get it over with    The thing that stuck with me after reading this book is how important it is to fully consider the people you are talking to  I had forgotten to care about other people  I have been trying to win friends by being impressive and interesting  but reading this book made me re realize that the best way to get people to like you is to like them  Find them interesting  Genuinely care about their life  They ll appreciate it  a really good summarisation of things to consider when dealing with people in personal and professional life  The anecdotes in the book are old but still quite relevant especially the ones quoted from a personal context  Carnegie s book is a  must read  for anyone working in business  dealing with people  or for those who simply want to become more adept at personal inter relations  He writes in a very simple  easy to read style  and the book is replete with personal anecdotes which both emphasize his many points  while at the same time keeping the flow and pacing fresh  lively  and relevant  This is the kind of book you want to highlight  keep on your shelf  and refer back to frequently   I feel this is a book for anyone wishing to have good communication skills  It has a lot of steps mentioned  It becomes difficult to remember so many steps  But it is revolving around some basic steps like appreciation  listening  courtesy and some more  It tells you to avoid criticism and pinpointing wrongdoings directly at maximum occasions  This is a must read for any sales and marketing person who wants to speak in terms of the buyer  Filled with lots of interesting anecdotes  but nothing too ground breaking  A must read for all Type A s out there     Great book for start in self improvement  I found this book very interesting and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would There are lots of tips that can be used today in both business and in ones personal life  Makes complete sense in every decadeThink less of yourself and more of others A classic  Some recommendations seem very obvious  yet people still don t do them  A good read for those interested in personal communication  psychology  and business  It s a classics  with all the pluses and minuses implied  This book teaches you how  when interacting with people  you should think less about  me  me  me   and try and focus more on the other person  This is something that I forget most of the times  and this book taught me to be a little bit more considerate about the other person s thoughts  judge less  and  most importantly  admit more that even if I m right  this doesn t make the other person be wrong It s mostly a book that teaches about tolerance  diplomacy and being friendly  suggests that you give more honest compliments  smile more often and have more empathy towards others  I saved lots of notes from this book  and I will surely go back to read them again from time to time  This is a manual on how to be a  people person   Reading it is like having a wise grandfather nudge you oh so gently into being a better and more pleasant human being  Carnegie s style is clear  conversational  and filled with anecdotes  Lots of common sense  Most people would benefit from reading this  The basic message is this  be nice  and your life will work out a little better  Great read and really makes you re evaluate how you interact with other people   Minhas acoes pessoais melhoraram depois de conhecer as instrucoes desse livro Finally read this classic  Its timeless wisdom is simply brilliant  Unsurprisingly  many professional development concepts have their roots in this work  Classic for a reason  These are simple concepts that go a long way  The thinking behind Carnegie s work here may be hard for one to adjust to  but what you will find through the course of this text is that there is mileage left in kindness and sincere approbation   Be lavish in your praise  and giving others the spotlight  to make another feel important  even for a few moments  listening emaptheically  is very often rewarded with surprising leaps in cooperation  sour grapes into sumptuous wine  This classic has been on my To Read list for a long time  I was recently inspired to pick it up because of an article I read on Book Riot  A woman with Asperger s wrote that this book was a life changing tool for her  helping her understand people in a way that she struggled to do on her own  I found this book to be much more relevant than I expected from something written in the 1930s  Many are lessons I ve picked up as I ve matured  but it was cool to see it written here  I now wonder if I ve indirectly learned from this source  considering how influential it is  nearly rising to the level of modern common sense  A lot of this advice will stick with me  when it comes to work and personal relationships  I read this book as a freshman in high school and it really changed the way I look at life  Many of the suggestions come naturally to some people  but for me it was a real eye opener  I would recommend this book to anyone trying to improve their basic personal relations skills  Full of useful advice to develop good interpersonal relations  Must read it again after some time to see how much I could gain from it  There was a distant era when common sense was more or less  well  common  How to Win Friends and Influence People is like a lost dispatch from that long ago time  It is complete with delightfully archaic second hand testimonials from people like Ebenezer Whooping Cough of the Long Island Buggy Whip Company  A star of Sharknado 2 named Wil Wheaton boiled the book down to a core statement  Don t Be a Dick The book does contain some basic truths about listening  kindness and consideration  Those notes should ring true in any era  To summarize   be positive and non confrontational   There was something comforting in reading this book  that sense of nostalgia  that sort of      things were sure simpler back then yet still never change  feel to the anecdotes  It s the kind of feeling you get when you see an old  black and white news reel  Every example of  Joe  a Department Head at Acme Inc   reminded me of the office in the movie   The Apartment    those neatly aligned rows of desks each with a typewriter and the same neatly dressed worker bees  Anyway  I think the advise was worthy and I plan to review the points and try to follow them   I have read this numerous times  but it is always a good read and reminder Weltherrschaft  A good book full of timeless wisdom  yet obviously written for a different era  If only schools taught these rules of thumb in human relationships instead of the self esteem movement  Giving shit about people is the key here  Very interesting read  I can see why this is considered a classic  Each chapter is centered around a principle that can help with social interactions  Using interesting anecdotes  Dale Carnegie shows the value of these principles and how they can be applied I am very happy I got around to reading this book  I am so convinced of the value of the principles included in this book  that I will make sure to read again this book every few years to remind myself of them  Timeless classic  Spot on about human nature and relationships  both business and personal   This is a good book with good concepts  This book has simple concepts which will indeed create a master quality personality if followed genuinely  This is a book for people  It s not about being cruel or admitting you are a nerd  it s about how to get along with people  I don t think the title is what the book is all about but the concepts of this book is over rated  One quote I like the most from the book is Don t be afraid of enemies who attack you  Be afraid of the friends who flatter you  This book is a Timeless classic  well worth the read  I d give this book a 4 stars  must read for everyone A timeless business classic  This book should be required reading for every adult  All of the philosophies in this book are relevant  maybe even more so  in our modern times  My only issue with this book is the dialog used to make points   some of it has not aged well and could do with a revision Worth a read or two  Extraordinary    Though this book was written in early 1930 s or may be before but the authors understanding of human behavior and their apt nature is astonishing  The ways to overcome such issues and how will one can influence others are remarkable Some techniques I ve already applied and those were fruitful but some techniques I found were old fashioned  People may not respond well after attempting these techniques Still I enjoyed reading the fruitful short stories and I must say this book have really bring positivity in me  I think of it as sesame street for adults  The book covers topics like    put yourself in others  shoes  don t insult people  smile  etc  Having said that  it s a compelling read and a good reminder of basic communication skills  If everyone read this book  we would have a much gentler and understanding society  This book is a bestselling classic for a reason the principles taught really work  The sum of the book is this  To better lead  change  and influence people  you must make them feel important  The rest of the book is an extrapolation of that  how to make people feel important  Giving sincere praise  admitting your own mistakes when your trying to point out something in a person you want to change  etc  The book is very helpful   No matter your age  profession  or stage in life i think everyone should read this book  So much good advice on how to deal with people  Everything in here makes so much sense and really helps to give some insight into what makes some more successful than others  Definitely recommend  A well written book  Enjoyed reading it    Not many things in this world would stand true after almost a century  This is one of those books where the thoughts and ideas still remain pertinent to this day  According to me  every college student should read this book  if not present in their curriculum  This book teaches us how to really face the challenges of the corporate world and remain influential to get your ideas and thoughts through   There are several ways to read this book one of which is that in essence  human beings are a self involved race  We like to hear the sound of our own name and don t care much about anything else unless it affects us directly  Another way is that people are generally good but sometimes we need to be carefully made aware of other avenues that benefit not just themselves  but someone else as well Two sides  one coin  Smile  Don t talk about you  talk about them and how your idea product etc  will benefit them  There are many principles that Dale Carnegie lists after each major portion of this book  All principles are sound and there is a reason that this book has been in print for so long  Do yourself a favour and read this book if you are having problems dealing with people in general  If nothing else  it is good food for thought  Still effective after all these years      Frequently over idealistic to the point of being kind of naive  but nevertheless a great read full of good stories and insights  Very nice book with very practical ideas on human relations   A great work by Mr  Carnegie  The heart of the principle is the examples given by Mr  Carnegie it will encourage you to the level that you should apply this to your day to day life  a great and a must read book for the people who relates with any professional courses  I highly recommend it to my family and friends  and and it will surely transform you to some level  Interesting  Taking the course in March and thought this would be beneficial   Self improvement book  good principles to improve social skills and be more effective potential contentious situations  Good read  Read this one years ago but still recall some of the ideas shared in this book  Excellent read  Important messages for anyone with a desire to improve their leadership skills  Truly valuable advice for introverts  Gives you tools to hack the fuzzy humans  Carnegie is the best without a shadow of a doubt  His simplicity  relevance and technique really helps us to go deep in to the subject of building human connections  While reading the book I was thinking about five since some of the ideas sounded really great  An instant cookbok for everyone who needs to influence people  But then I thought about it again and found out the magic was gone  The principles presented are not that bad but the stories presented sound like from 100 years ago and it is hard to believe they could still happen nowadays And this is probably the biggest issue I have with the book  It is focused on great impression and assumes you want to make the best first impression all the time  But would you rather have hundreds of people who admire you for a single act or a couple of real friends who like you for who you truly are Even thought my comments may sound negative  I highly recommend reading this book  I read this some years ago  and it really is a helpful read for business professionals   This was a really helpful book when I was an undergrad first living away from home  This was pretty good  but the title is misleading  I think a better title would be  Effectively dealing with colleagues  salespeople  clients and strangers   Looking at the reviews here on goodreads  they re mostly 5 stars or 1 star  This is a very polarizing book  and I think that s because of the misleading title  The  friends  part is wrong  It doesn t really go into what friendship is and how you find people that make good friends  Instead  it s a book full of techniques for more effectively dealing with colleagues  strangers  salespeople  clients  etc  These are people you didn t get to pick  But you still need to interact with them  To put it bluntly  this book sounds like a villain s manual  and it sort of is  But even if you have no nefarious goals I still think it s a worthwhile read Almost all of the techniques are illustrated with an anecdote that shows someone getting a business deal  or getting subordinates to obey rules and increase productivity  or on getting children to listen  What on earth is friendship  How do you find it  Why is there chemistry between some people  and not with others  This book won t answer those questions  It may help you to get along with people  but whether that leads to friendship remains to be seen This book did I into the question that I ve been pondering for a while   If you want others to do something  how convince them to do it   There are countless ways of asking someone to do something  some ways work  others don t and some even cause them to do the very opposite  And the only thing that was different is how you asked them  This book is about exactly that  The book is a bit oldfashioned  but since it s from the 1930 s  that s to be expected  Believe the book has been edited somewhat for a more modern audience Do the techniques work  Well  I plan to try them myself but I ve only just finished the book  so I can t really say yet But I have noticed many of the techniques used on me  by salespeople  Have you ever noticed street or door to door salespeople start by asking a string of questions to which you will invariably answer  yes   That s in the book too  I remember learning about professional feedback techniques  sandwich negative feedback between positive feedback  This book has similar ideas To sum up  good book  misleading title  How to make friends is still a mystery  I am so amazed at how relevent this book is  and it was written in 1936 Muy util  Recomendado jmyl jdan  mn nHy   rD lqSS wlslwb lmshwWq wlGyr muml   slwb shyWq wstfdt mnh Hqyqhl jb  n dyl

Excellent livre qui nous rappelle et qui nous enseigne les valeurs pour les relations humaines applicable tout au long d une vie  good for beginners   who has just started into reading self   help book  Basically just be genuinely nice rather than having any secrets or tricks  but sometimes it s good to be reminded that  The descriptions of presidents who were nice and humble reminded me of The West Wing  It s an easy read  The concepts are very straightforward and I think people generally already know them subconsciously but just don t really apply them  Great book to learn about human behaviour   A classic   This book had a lot of great ideas and reminders  but way to many examples  I found it ironic as he talked about how over used the word  I  is in conversation  yet many examples he started just that way  It is a great thing to think of others feeling and thoughts  Do you know people that all conversations and comments go back to them  This book is for them   But they likely will not realize it       Comment se faire des amis   Derriere ce titre se cache bien plus que ce a quoi on pourrait s attendre  l ouvrage s adresse a quiconque souhaiterait avoir de meilleurs relations avec les gens de son entourage  Vous y trouverez des principes simple efficace et des exemples de situations concretes vous permettant de comprendre et vous aider a appliquer le principe   Il s agit pas seulement d un ouvrage  comment faire    mais plutot un  Devenez l ami que tout le monde veut avoir    Great for people who really need this information and a validation for those who already practice this human relations advice  It has info about how to be like the others  To me I see them as suggestions  Because of this book  i always trying smile to other people  And it seems like my feel become so great  Thanks Dale    you re my motivator  Everyone should read this book   EVERYONE  Everything this book teaches is so basic  simple  and seems so easy to practice  Just a few changes in the way you say or present something can make a huge difference  This is a book that I will purchase and refer to as needed   The book is more about how to deal with tough people and how to get people to do what you want them to do without them resenting you  A lot of it was common sense to me but I also learned a few new things  Overall it was interesting reading the stories of people who have tried his advice and how that worked out for them  Of course only the stories that worked out well are included in this book  I d like to know the ratio of the number of times his advice works to the number of times it doesn t hdh lktb mkhtlf qlyl  n bqy lktb  b d qrtk lhdh lktb lmly blmwqf wlqSS wlHkm wlfkrtsh r btGyyr mn fkrk wtfhmk llmwqf wllHy  wlns wlnfsk yD wlw qlyl    ljmyl

Lincoln  the basics to communication Don t be fooled by this book s title  Dale s classic book is actually about how to be a decent and respectful person that empathize with others and respect their opinion As an added bonus  the book s many examples are also a peek into a not so distant past  where industrialization was still a recent memory and the civil war was just a generation away  All in all a very enjoyable book  ktb jmyl jd    l  Hb lktb lty tqwl lk f l hdh wl tf l dhk dwn  n ykhbrk kyf tf l dhk  l mthl  lwq y  wltjrb lshkhSy  l shkhS kthr hy m t Tyk ldf   n tjrb  nt  yDlnsn hw lnsn wlTby   lbshry  ndr m ttGyr  br lmkn w lzmn I really enjoyed this book  Although it is self help and not necessarily a page turner  Dale Carnegie keeps it upbeat and moving  The advice found in the book was very helpful with basic ideas on how to get along with family members  friends  co workers etc  I did find that about 3 4 of the way through I was feeling a little overloaded with information  but I still think it was worth the read  You pick and choose a few ideas that you want to work on and leave the rest of advice for another day  I would definitely recommend it  This book enlightened me about how people in general think and also taught me how to get along with them in the workplace or at home  I loved it  Can t wait to try out all of the things I ve learned   A classic of self improvement books  with many followers and epigons  It has been written more then 70 years ago  and it is still to be used nowadays  It is smart  not boring  easy to read and it seems it was written with real passion  Overall I enjoyed this book and thought there was a lot of good advice in it  It seems that some of the advice is redundant or just a rewording of previous advice  For instance  it s hard to see much of a material difference between4  Be a good listener  Encourage others to talk about themselves and6  Let the other person do a great deal of the talking The stories he relates to bolster his points were my favorite part of the book  While many of the names were unknown to me  there are many famous presidents and politicians used as well  if you aren t familiar with their lives  you should still recognize the names  This is probably the ancestor of all the self help books on interpersonal relationships  I liked it because it made me think a lot  but I won t necessarily memorize and apply every principle he presented in the book  Here s why First of all  the whole book is devoted to how to make other people think positively of you  It s very anxiety inducing when you try to impress others and worry about what they think  The examples in this book lead readers to believe that the techniques are failure proof  while as Carnegie himself says in the book  they just increase your chance of success  not guarantee it  So what to do when you apply the principles but still get rejected  Secondly  I can always sense a hint of manipulation as I read it  You try to be kind to people not because you want to lure them into liking you and giving you what you want  but because you care about them genuinely and believe that people are good in general  Working on how to phrase your words alone does not bring you sincere relationships  Respect others as individual human beings  each with a unique history  Learn about and from them  Be honest  Don t take negative feedback personally but see it as an opportunity to grow  These are just the basics  but they are what helps you truly connect to others and be happy with your life  I was not too keen on reading this book at first as I thought it was only for those who are socially awkward and have difficulty in making friends  but that could not be further from the truth  Carnegie writes with a no nonsense approach on human relations and how we can all improve our interpersonal relationships  This book is both timeless and life transforming  I will be surprised if there is not a single person out there who could not learn at least one thing from Carnegie  who could not benefit at least slightly from having read this book   Worth re reading throughout life    This was the book way back when that got me thinking about life and how to enjoy it     Friends are the backbone of all existence  enjoy    Read this book  life does not change     it a nice book   Good principles  but too many examples that seemed to carry on too long   Simple principles  and it s clear that they can make a difference  It s not always so easy to apply them though  Good read  Overall it was an interesting book  It contain information about how to interact and communicate with other people  It also has a good way in the writing   This book gives an basic insight of people psychology   It could be serve as basic to know how people think and response to some action in our general live  One of those books that are firmly standing the test of time  I just think everyone should read this book at one point in their career life  A really basic book  So basic that Danny Raede from Aspergers Experts recommends it because it s perfect for aspies    spells things that are obvious to others out in a step by step way I think this is probably the best self help book I have ever read  The  principles Carnegie suggests are as relevant now as they were when the book was first published in the 50 s My favourite quotes principles from the book include 1  By criticizing  we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment2  You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in youA well written  interesting  authentic and thought provoking book that is sure to inspire and motivate you  Read it a long time ago  time to read it again  The original self help book  Everyone should read it once knowing it will stir conversation around tactics vs  character  I think that that book is really good  Despite its searching for perfection and ignoring the real life which is full of contradictions and no one can apply these principles with joy  But I liked the style of Dale Carnegie he put stories that support his thoughts and ideas and making the main point clear   IT s a very nice book ktb Gyrny kthyr    How to Win Friends and Influence people by Dale Carnegie is a book about how to make more friends  win more arguements and become a leader  The book began by explaining how to make people like you more  It was summarized into 6 main points like be geninuely interested in other people  smile  and to use peoples names as much as possible  The second section was all about winning an arguement it had 12 major points  They included  trying to avoid arguements in the first place  letting the other person do all the talking  and letting the person figure out what you want themselves  The final section discussed being a leader  It had 9 points that included  begin with praise and appreciation  use encouragement  and talk about your mistakes to the other person  I thought this book was very well written  it used example from famous people in history like President Lincoln  Rockefeller  and Andrew Carnegie  I thought that the use of these examples did alot to convince the readers to believe his points  I would recommend this book to people who want to be leaders someday  Also I would recommend this book to anyone who is trying to make friends  All in all I d say this book is a worthy book to read for anyone trying to add leadership skills  It s certainly an interesting book  I won t necessarily use it to win  friends  but it s an important and very relevant reference for everyday corporate politics  It offers some good insights and valuable lessons on leadership traits and plays on human psychology  Read it with an open mind and apply in your own way   This book is very helpful in our level of influence towards friends  colleagues and even the hard to win difficult people  I liked the strategic way to handle them   The first self help book I ever read  Lots of powerful insights  Highly recommended reading  Seem like good points for making conversation  many of which people tend to forget How valid are these points in our day and age  Only results can answer that  OkIE OKIE  While dated is still a very good read with advices worth implementing  A highly informative book with detailed explanations for every recommendation given  Extremely well written and consistently provides the reader with a steady stream of easy to understand examples from real life scenarios  The author frequently repeats the advices given in the previous chapters and summarizes them regularly  allowing the reader to keep pace with everything that has been taught  Very profitable book to read and study  Very simple and engaging so far   Dale Carnegie s rhetoric arguments on public relations will never be out of date because human nature will never change  His book deserves its title as a timeless best seller  Its eloquently written and states different principles and more than a handful of examples on applying them  I would recommend it to EVERYONE  It will help you as an employee  employer  spouse  salesman  parent  boss  friend  politicians  etc    Basically it will make you an all around better person  This is an incredible book  I ve heard people mention it for years and years and thought the idea of it was so stupid  The way some people talked about it made it seem like it was a book for scoundrels or for socially awkward people  I didn t want to be either  so I didn t want to read it  Finally  a great friend of mine recommended it to me and I started reading it  This is a book for people  It s not about being evil or admitting you re nerdy  it s about how to get along with people  Anyone who ever has problems getting along with people should read this book  I know I do  but this book has completely changed my perspective  This really comes close to a life changing book  The main point of this book is that if you want to have friends and be successful  you should be nice not mean  It sounds so obvious and I thought I was doing it  but now I realize all the mean things that I ve done and still do to people when I don t get along with them  As I ve read this book  and I ll work hard to do this from now on  I ve tried to think more about the other person s perspective when I disagree with them and it helps so much  I ve already noticed a change in the way I interact with people  This is a great book  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get along with other people  It s a very humbling yet empowering book  My only complaint with this book is that due to being written in 1936 it s focussed on very masculine social interactions  Working on the hill I found that  relational aggression  was much more common  and this book doesn t offer any solutions  Vot ia nakonets to i dobralsia do shiroko

think about  I didn t believe it at first but because some concepts do build on each other later on the suggestion to read each chapter twice before going to the next really REALLY helps   I mark in my book good points  I will say A  it s a little older of a book but still holds true even today and B  some stuff for me I struggle breaking old habits even though I should be doing  exactly the opposite LOL  VERY USEFUL There are some  use it today  info in here too like why some people love babies and can have a great friendships with their dogs in such a short time  babies genuinely smile back at people and dogs are truly interested in their owners  On the flip side is also true  being fake with people makes things worse  Another favorite of mine is how important small talk can be  Seems wasteful but it goes a long way to building trust in communication  when people have common ground  they are used to talking to you  share common interests or past  etc  it helps  Also it s been repeatedly measured in many countries people who play games together trust each other 11x faster than people who only work together   aka why I need a PS3  This was slow read for me  however highly recommended   Great book  Makes plain the things we all know unconsciously   This book may have been slightly over hyped for me  but I still feel like I understand the basic principles taught here  Basically  this is a book of etiquette and manners and I definitely try to pay attention to these more frequently now  Classic  Never tired to read it again and again  Taitsa nauditav raamat  eriti

all lived by the principles Dale Carnegie laid out in the  Win Friends  portion of this book  This book is full of not so common common sense  It s good to be reminded of these principles  I would recommend this book to others  It s a good book  Has nice stories   Much better than I expected  Much less gross  Good for folks like me that need some reminders on best practices for being a nice human being to people  even if you re not interested in  winning friends and influencing people   WELCOME To My Small World of Embroidery embroidery blogspot comI read a few books and articles this year that reference this book  so I thought I d pull it out again  I first read this book when I was 17 and it really opened my eyes  I remembered that it impacted me and figured the lessons were worth revisiting  While this is mostly true  I d forgotten  perhaps chose to forget  how dated some of these anecdotes are  Beyond the  Golly gee  That s swell   types of exchanges  you can t overlook that it was written at a time before global corporations and billion dollar mergers  And let s face it  our attention spans are at an all time low and our needs for instant gratification are at an all time high  People deal with each other differently now  In some ways  we communicate more efficiently  but in my opinion  we also tend to hear more of what we want to hear  so being CLEAR is more important than being KIND   image error The overall principals of treating people the way you d like to be treated remain the best course of action  The author tends to go a little overboard with repeating some of his points  but maybe some people need to be beaten over the head to understand the kind of impact their words and behavior have on their peers and loved ones  However  I m concerned that following the directions set forth by this antiquated literature to the letter could lead to some serious crushing of careers  happiness  and well being  Maybe I m becoming meaner or more jaded or both  but if you re one of the handful of people who hasn t read this yet  read it with a grain of salt    or read a book on negotiation  which is probably what you re really looking for anyway

Breckenridge Carnegie s How to Win Friends   Influence People Book Review by Vanga SrikanthAbout the AuthorDale Carnegie  1888 1955  described himself as a  simple country boy  from Missouri but was also a pioneer of the self improvement genre  Since the 1936 publication of his first book  How to Win Friends and Influence People  he has touched millions of readers and his classic works continue to impact lives to this day  Book Review by Vanga SrikanthThis book mainly offers examples of a practical form of diplomacy  Don t criticize people directly so as to shame them  always articulate your sincere compliments when appropriate  make an effort to remember and use a person s name  etc  There s some good advice here on finessing your speech to get your honest point across without causing anyone to begrudge you for it  and some ways to train yourself not to take people for granted However  this book was written a long time ago  for people with average or better communications skills  If you re shy and introverted  or have autism or Asperger s  this is not the book to coax you out of yourself  This isn t to say it s of no use to an introverted person  but using the techniques advocated will be more of a challenge  His advice is so obvious and so easy  so how come it s so difficult to do yourself and so rarely found in others  Is it cynicism or manipulation  No  it s human nature  Do Unto Others THE FUNDAMENTALS Speak ill of no man and speak all the good you know of everyone  People react very badly to criticism  don t do it  not to their face nor behind their back     especially not behind their back  Say  Thank You  Express appreciation  People yearn  yearn to be appreciated  Talk about what people want and help them get it  Arouse in others an eager want  Corollary  let others take credit for your ideas  they ll like your ideas a lot more if they believe them to be their own  WAYS TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU Be happy to see people Greet everyone you meet and show an interest in them  Remember the things that are important to them  Smile  Remembers peoples  names  Remember it  use it when talking to them  A person s name sounds beautiful to them  Draw people out Encourage them to talk about themselves and their interests    Actively research the other person s interests Every person you meet feels themselves superior to you in some way Strain to find out what that is and recognize their importance  Talk to people about themselves and they will listen to you for hours WIN PEOPLE TO YOUR WAY OF THINKING Don t argue Give in  Agree that the other person is right  often they are and if they aren t  you ll never convince them of it by arguingDon t ever tell a person they re wrong They may be but telling them so is always counterproductive  It is difficult for a person to admit to themselves that they are wrong  harder still to admit it to others Friendliness begets friendliness Always begin that way  Don t accuse Never neglect a kindness Look for ways to do or say something nice Start out by emphasizing areas of agreement When a person has said  no  it s hard to get them to change even if they know they re wrong Let the other person do most of the talking Listen patiently and don t interrupt  Let your friends be better than you Let people come to your conclusions First  tell me what you expect of me  then tell me what I can expect of you  People will generally live up to the commitments they make to you as long as they came up with them on their own  Think always in terms of the other person s point of view Where they stand depends on where they sit  figure out where they re sitting of the people you will ever meet are dying for sympathy Give it to them and they will love you  A soft answer turneth away wrath  but grievous words stir up anger  Dramatize your ideas  Don t use logic  tell stories   Make your ideas visible  concrete  Bear in mind that people don t know until you show them what you mean Stimulate in others their innate desire to excel  perhaps through a friendly challenge or through competition  BE A LEADER Don t go sailing into difficult interpersonal situations with guns blazing  You ll always get a negative reaction Change  but  into  and  Be indirect in your criticism  Praise before you condemn Ask questions rather than giving orders Be very careful to help others preserve their dignity People crave recognition  praise the smallest improvement and praise every improvement Treat people as though they had the virtues you wished they possessed Give them a reputation to live up to and they will work like crazy to live up to it Praise the good  minimize the bad  encourage Make achievement seem possible  Take and encourage little baby steps  Seek out even the most insignificant of successes Napoleon  I could conquer the world if only I had enough ribbon RegardsVanga Srikanth An excellent book on how our humans relate to and rely on each other  It teaches us how to handle with human relationships in a tender manner  Mo matter what we do  we do rely on or need each other for survival and success  good tips to appy I know I am not good at expressing myself peacefully so  I picked this book to see if there is something I am doing wrong  Yes  there are so many subtle but very important things that  according to this book  I can and should do in my everyday verbal interactions  I ve always tried to be as direct and frank as possible and never taken into account the emotional reactions to my opinions since I had just assumed that they should have been mature enough to accept my opposing views without feeling hostility toward me  I am sure this has never been the case and I may have offended many of them  unintentionally  The recipe is simple  I have to consider in my conversations the fact that I am going to talk with an egotist  sensitive and careless person just like myself  I have to smile  consider the benefits of other persons  not to engage in arguments and not to criticize them directly or else I have to face ill intention and defensive attitude  I am not sure that reading a book does make me better at communication but the least I have got from reading this book is knowing that there are principles which can be followed in order to gain more from interpersonal communications  I hope I can use them from now on   I feel like it got very redundant towards the end  Sometimes a little too anecdotal  Overall still very good  A uno puede darle verguenza tener un libro con este titulo tan directo  Puede sonar desesperado o egocentrico  Ciertamente no lo recomendaria o regalaria a quien no le tuviera confianza  Claro  eso es solo por el titulo  Ademas  siendo este libro el abuelo de los libros de autoayuda  su lenguaje hoy suena complaciente y barato  Pero eso solo es el prejuicio que uno lleva antes de leer El contenido es excelente  Una vez que lo lees con honestidad y mente abierta  descubres excelentes consejos para aplicar en tu vida  La propia introduccion muestra que los concejos no son fruto de la filosofia personal del autor  sino de su estudio de decenas de biografias y relatos de personas prominentes  Ese es  para mi  el gran valor del libro Mi consejo personal  Para aplicar estos consejos  es importante recordar la honestidad y la fuerza interior  Si una persona quiere ser falsa o hipocrita  o necesita constante validacion de otros  estos concejos no le serviran  Cultivate primero a ti mismo  antes de salir a influenciar a los demas  the name of this book put me off for a long time  and it has aged a little  but the majority of content is actually really good  Really good book  Very simple and positive  a quick read  One of the better books that I have read about everyday social interactions This book has advise that I am convinced is a very reliable way to become a likeable even lovable friend  worker  relative  spouse  etc The only weird thing to me is that  being I m a bible student  the book teaches a lot of things that the bible teaches  The book claims that nowhere would you find the information the book shares but almost every time the books gives an advise I couldn t help but notice an identical teaching is found in the bible  In other words my take away was  just be a good Christian   Tho  a good thing about the book is that explains the various approaches without preaching or sounding dogmatic  The book offers good solid techniques in handling people  I was amazed by the author s deep insight on human desire and tendency He calls upon the reader to accept the fact that we are nothing more than a small existence craving for recognition by others  Classic book   title self explanatory  Good tips and good practice especially to build work and social relationships  I think to properly understand this book you have to keep in mind the context in which it was written  This book seems primarily focused on building salesmanship  not Machavellian power or influence  Also  it was written during the Great Depression  a time I imagine people were desperate for success and data driven decision making was not possible  With that said some suggestions seem rather patronizing  especially those pertaining to leadserhip However  this book is still chock full of good advice  An overarching theme that stood out to me is that you must be able to get other people to connect with your ideas  That is  they must be able to get something out of it Eric There are a few books that EVERYONE must read  This is one of them  I can t describe the impact that this book has had on my life  It was one of the first books that I read in this genre and it has helped keep me reading more and more  I believe the book How to Win Friends   Influence Peoplr aspires to teach great  soulful  men how to indulge lesser men in their petty vanities with flattery and patience  as with a child  so as to win their support and adoration  Good stuff   It was a good read  enjoyed the different situations as narrated by others  Made me feel like I was sitting in a Dale Carnegie class  Could do without certain comparisons towards the end but otherwise excellent principles   King of the self help books provides useful tips to interact with others  Yep  definitely worth a read  You just have to skim over the blatantly sexist parts    Self Help1020L Although it got a little repetitive at times  not all the time   I definitely appreciated the book  Usually when I read a chapter s   I would try to put it into practice that day  if not the following day  Great read  I read this book in the early nineties  while I was taking the course Dale Carnegie courseat KMPG  It helped me a lot to give presentations and or stand in front of a group  I never feel afraid or anything negative when I do so  I can t remember the trainers  name  but he was an inspiration  Pretty valuable information  Some of the examples are hokey and dated  They make the techniques seem like the  Jedi mind trick   But the general idea has a lot of merit  I m glad I had to read it as  homework  for work   This book is a must read at least once per year  I read this in conjunction with my Dale Carnegie workshop  I love Dale Carnegie   it was better than therapy  The advice is sound and practical  I was happy with the way it demanded sincerity  where one might fear that such a book would encourage the reader to be manipulative and use generally unwholesome tactics  I enjoyed the old timey feel  but actually think I d have preferred the original version  because it was weird having an example from the seventies tossed in when the bulk of the text is clearly decades older  On that note  like most self help books I find that the work is padded with too many examples  It might be just as worthwhile to study the bullet list of techniques and apply them without going through the entire book   Self help books can be dicey Many of them seem to riff on the same ideas  or at least this is the impression most Amazon summaries reviews give   and the few I ve flicked through in libraries and bookstores seem to lean more towards the  You can do it  Think positive and it ll happen  Hazzaaa   side  They re painful and often give the vibe that they are written by people who aren t sure of any of the things they re writing about  but have read enough self help books that they feel they have been helped  I always wonder how many people are just hiding their own issues by being distracted through pretending to know what they re talking about Practicality is often missing  plausible examples slim  This is where Carnegie s little classic goes in a different direction I was surprised by how enjoyable the book was  and although the format started to feel a little tired towards the end  I still raced through to the very last page  The advice is incredibly hands on and offered up by students experiences  and I found myself starting to apply what I was reading within a few days and noticed some improvements in how I felt around people and how people seemed to feel around me The shortest possible way of putting all the advice is  Be nice   Be nice  is a deceptive little phrase that has many shades  There are many different ways to be nice  but most of us seem to go for the default of just asking  how s it going   while passing a coworker in the hallway and think our selves so brilliant for being so nice  All this in spite of the fact that we are normally hoping we don t get anything more than a  Great   in response  Please  nothing real I found in How To Win Friends and Influence People some interesting ways to hold court with those you interact with  be they friends  strangers or coworkers  in a way that was relaxed and enjoyable  Awkward silences seemed to have disappeared  in their place are happy little conversations I ve read some people suggest the  How to win friends  element of the title is a little misconstrued as most of what is found in the book wouldn t allow for much more than a superficial relationship without much bonding  After reading the book and thinking it worth my time  I still find myself agreeing with this  This won t win you lifelong friends  at least not directly  Much of what is covered by Carnegie involves subtly shifting conversation so it is more pleasant for all parties  but in a way that suggests business friendships will be built  not real ones  However I must add one caveat   while the techniques here may not grant one real  bonding friendships  I can see how the techniques allow the foundation for one to be laid down  It leaves opportunity for exciting conversation to spring forth when nothing but formal  robotic discussions might have previously been the norm But for it to be of any value  one must take what is written as small lessons and be conscious in their daily application  It s a book that would probably improve as one refers back to it weekly  rereading the highlighted passages they found interesting and going over the summaries at the end of each chapter  This isn t a magical set and forget type selfhelp book  it does require work  but is work worth doing An interesting realisation is that Carnegie was using many of the techniques he wrote about in the book on the reader  Every now and then you would catch a phrase or use of language that was written about earlier  but in a way to help you agree with what was being said  Sly  for sure  but it at least shows the man lived what he preached  Reading this book has made me realize that you can t force someone to believe you and your train of thought  You also can t tell someone to do something without praising what the other person does first  otherwise they will resent you for it  Praising is always better than criticizing  Think thoroughly well before you act   Guy s got some good insights  Great book  Interesting stories and leadership ideas  Read this in high school as my mother owned it  Interesting Thought it was about time to read this  Incredible how its still popular 70 years after it was first written  This was a good book  but I do believe it has a major flaw This advice is most effective for men  and probably would be ineffective for women  Women who listen  who go out of their way to be nice   smiling  never criticizing  acting appreciative  making the other person feel important  all things Carnegie suggests    are generally seen as pushovers and are subsequently walked over   by their employees  by their employers  and by their coworkers  By contrast  when men do the things Dale Carnegie describes  especially when that man is your employer  he is soon as a fair and upright man who is doing you a special favor in listening respecting you etc  La comunicacion con humanos  la ultima frontera  Estas son las lecturas de Ferio en una mision que durara toda la eternidad  dedicada a camuflarse entre la gente  normal   al descubrimiento de vida inteligente  if any   hasta alcanzar las habilidades necesarias para subyugar al resto de la poblacion con una sonrisa  Forzada  pero sonrisa  Dientes  dientes  que eso es lo que les jode Este manual de comunicacion formaba parte de una coleccion que estaba en el piso en el que vivo  pero se lo regale a alguien empenado en dominar el mundo  hace poco me acorde de el y termine comprandoselo a la empresa para la que trabaja  ha ganado doblemente  Aparte de esta interesante anecdota  ahora deberia criticar sesudamente el libro  pero estoy en el trabajo con fiebre y no voy a dar mucho de si Siendo el libro tipico en estas lides  el que todos los programas perilleros de radio mencionan siempre  el que los nazis nunca usaron y asi les fue  opino que da consejos muy utiles basados en el sentido comun y el Contrato Social  pero que resultan ingenuos e incluso inefectivos en un tiempo en el que estamos de vuelta de todo y las ciencias sociales han medido ya todo al dedillo  Tambien es un libro netamente protestante maniqueo  las cosas se pueden hacer bien o mal  no hay grises en su mundo de color Aun asi  dice cosas muy valiosas  de esas que no cobran sentido en tu mente hasta que alguien las escribe y tu las lees a pesar de que nos han sido ensenadas ya antes  En este sentido de hacer evidentes las cosas que se nos ensenaron formalmente y olvidamos socialmente es valioso  aunque mucho habra que entrenarlas para que se conviertan en automatismos y  en los tiempos del divagar mental de las redes sociales  me veo poco capaz de concentrarme en sonreir o empatizar  Bueno  empatizar no lo he hecho nunca  no va a venir este libro a enderezarme ahora   Otra cosa que me ha gustado es que es muy ligero porque  mas alla de la escasa teoria que desarrolla poco  cuenta un monton de chismorreos de gente que ha pervivido mejor o peor en la Historia y  a traves de esos ejemplos  ves como sus ensenanzas se cumplen  Esto tiene otra cara opuesta  claro  en ningun caso pone ejemplos que no vengan como anillo al dedo para lo que quiere decir  y deduzco que habra nueve situaciones desagradables por cada una en la que se cumpla la profecia  pero esto no es malo necesariamente  solo senal de que el autor conocio a un monton de gente maja en su vida Es un libro muy util para convertirte en el maridito ideal que llega a su casa de dos plantas de los suburbs a las 6 PM y tu mujercita te trae las pantuflas y tienes sexo con el perro antes de la cena  y los domingos cortas el coche y limpias el cesped   Seguir a rajatabla todos sus consejos te convierte en una persona agradable que probablemente no tenga mucha cabida en el mundo actual  aun asi  no esta de mas conocerlos por si algun dia dieramos con una persona educada que no este nunca a la defensiva  Como decia antes  la ultima frontera  This book was good I respect the wisdom that Dale Carnegie provides and some principles  I like he states that is not good to criticize that people usually don t work best under criticism   however   in order to influence people make them believe that they perfect whatever one may be struggling don t just critique him because honestly people just don t respond well under criticism  That one thing I really took out from reading this and I really applying it to the old   new people I encounter everyday  Another wisdom he gives through this book that s really stood out is that everyone influence  in what position or status that you are in  Every single idnvidual has influence on someone and carry some type of influence  The only problem I had with this book is that I don t like the title  Is good to want to influence people however to win friends is a problem  The reality of life is that no everyone is going to agree with every thing you agree and decide to follow you  Its important that you let those things happen naturally and you strive whatever goals you want to strive for  Trust me people will follow   Fantastic book in human relations  Applicable for everyone  Look at the heart  What s your purpose This book offers some helpful guidelines for someone like me who sucks at dealing with people  But we must remember that it  is  a  means to an end  Why do you want to win friends and influence people in the first place   Klientite obichat da chuvstvat  che kupuvat  a ne  che im prodavat  Laroshfuko   Ako iskash da imash vragove

with your friends  and how to win the friends  There are very good examples given in this book  Really one of the best book I read  This was the book whose techniques got me become assistant manager and then manager at a sales organisation and led me to master the art of customer service  A good guide which tells how to attract good friends and influence people around you    It seems like a sound process  plenty of convincing anecdotes  evidence from leading historical figures to janitorial staff  and the odd clerk who became president   wouldn t mind some more supporting information from peer reviewed psych behavioral studies  Potentially excellent for improving business or political acumen  not sure how relevant it is to enriching one s personal life beyond the superficial friend   or follower   count  Adopting a sympathetic attitude to our neighbors and the rest of the world is certainly something many westerners should try out   I think it s worth pointing out that this book was purported to have been published before the final chapter was written   a chapter on ditching people who  despite your best efforts  continually interfere and hamper your progress and happiness in life    Clearly it wouldn t fit easily with the positive vibe that permeates the rest of the book  but it s another small something worth keeping in mind in light of the larger picture presented in the overall thesis  Do your best  but know that there are some exceptions to every rule   Note some of the anecdotes case studies presented in the book are antiquated in a post information age  automation means there is less room for flexibility in some business   occasionally even personal   transactions  no matter how personable you might be  There can be significantly more barriers to cross when dealing with modern mega corps before your message will be heard  A winning attitude and smile has to be accompanied by a great deal more persistence and wit  If automation or some other system is in place to prevent flexible procedure  requests may go on unheard almost indefinitely  Choose your battles  Or look for alternative roads outside of the big mess of modern litigious corporate nonsense  Great book on effective ways to interact with people  Good book worth reading  Excellent Book  helps out with lots of aspects in life Great tools for telling you how to do exactly what the name of the book is  great message and its one that you have to take notes on if you really want to apply what it teaches you  Kontraversiska knyga  teko sutikti zmoniu tiek girianciu  tiek peikianciu sia knyga  As asmeniskai ja giriu  Is pokalbiu isaiskejo  kad knyga nepatiko tiems  kurie tikejosi  kad knyga pades susirasti draugu  su kuriais galetu eiti i koncertus  alaus ir issilieti visas nuoskaudas  Deja  Si knyga apie kitokius  draugus   apie  draugus  is kuriu norime ar tai verslo  karjeros o gal ir kitokios naudos   Apie kiek vedmainiska draugyste  paremta gryniausiu egoizmu  Bet nepaisant to  knyga puikiai parasyta  daug pasakojimu is istorijos  pavyzdziu is realiu situaciju  Nors knyga ir sena  o kai kurie zmoniu bendravimo iprociai ir pakito  bet naudingos ir aktualios informacijos cia uztenka  Svarbu tik suprasti  apie kokius  draugus  cia kalbama ir neliksi nusivyles   Good read  full of anecdotes  intuitive  Helps to articulate and reflect upon our own principles  Obviously win win situations are always welcome  but some of the principles appeared manipulative  but then again where can anyone really draw a line feeling fully assured they are not  It s a classic for a reason  Truly timeless  so much to learn  applicable to everyone in every situation  A well written book  Enjoyed reading it    Most of it are our principles of Islam   i wish i can read it again one day   Sure  helpful   but a little canned   Classic book that I d wanted to read for years  Tons of info that would require several readings to get the most out of it  I took lots of notes  I found the first part of the book very helpful  It gets somewhat repetitive and he s mainly hammering home the same ideas in various contexts  This is surely geared toward businessmen aiming to  succeed  but the principles can be applied to family life  church  or whatever  I got the impression that Carnegie really cared about people and wanted to help them lead better lives  Helpful and recommended   As someone in the earlier comments pointed out  The book is essential   Not even for a minute I felt that this book was first published in 1936  It has classic written all over it  good advice This is an all time favorite of mine  I love self help and positive thinking books  This book teaches us how in the process of learning to change others to our liking  we change ourselves for the better as well Great book I have to read it again  Easy to read and useful  A lot if examples  Itll open your eyes so you see things from a diff angle  Def a good read  The steeping stones into the art of persuasion  I can see why it is such a best selling book  classic  everyone should read this  pas mal    de bonnes idees declinees a toutes les sauces    Should be mandatory reading in school  The title sounds sleazy  but this is a very good book on personal interactions  totally infunecing  totally friendly and worth reading every word twice  thrice and many times  The man may not be the best writer in the world  but his ideas are timeless  Couple his books with his 12 week class  and you ve got yourself a whole new outlook on people and life  The transformation I saw not only in the people in my class  but also in my self was amazing  If you can t take the Dale Carnegie training  then at least read the book  It s wonderful  When I started this book I was very apprehensive  I detested the title  but my plant manager required me to read it  Once I started into it  I was pleasantly surprised  Done with honesty the techniques are very good  My only problem with the book was the last few chapters on flashy salesmanship  Some really good tactics for getting people following your orders and work your will I believe that some aspects of this book can be implied by others and may sound repeated  but in general the author clarifies them for each situation individually with the proper examples  Introduced to me by an Uncle  in my teens it was an influential book  But after the author s end  kind of lost my confinence on his books  A book on my reading list forever  The turn of the century version of the  Secret   Written before the Great Depression this book was truly of gem about the human psyche  The tenants make sense and I should put into practice Carnegie s fundamentals  Written primarily for men in sales  I still think the book is a worthwhile read and an interesting look back at turn of the century America  Read a long time ago  Probably a good one I should look up and download from audible com  A well written book  Enjoyed reading it    It was a cute little book that was very fast and easy to read  Generally good advice  be nice to other people  try to empathize  etc  Not a lot of advice for what happens when you meet someone is who is totally unreasonable  however  he did emphasize that his techniques do not work all the time in all situations   The granddaddy of self help self improvement and such an often mentioned and referenced book  I consider it a classic  Yeah  maybe you don t completely agree with Dale Carnegie s politics or management style or whatever  but still  Seems like timeless advice  earnestly given  Glad I read it  Great general lessons for working with people in any setting  Life hack   Love the stories in this book Dale had an amazing story telling talent that draws your attention  His memory for details in so many accounts blows my mind  And his ability to use a true story to get important point across makes for an invaluable book  and time well spent  The knowledge you gain through reading this book surpasses the that of any other sales book  that I know of   Is it a sign of maturity that for most of the tips I was like  yeah  okay  I already try to do that   I took this book in small doses  There were so many fantastic nuggets I wanted to ingest ans let the information soak in  I loved the anecdotes and real world applications  If you are looking for a great business book look no farther than this one  ktb thry jdan wlkn ltHdy lHqyqy ykmn fy tTbyq m j fy lktb wlltzm bh  Can t schmooze  sp     then you need to read this  lol   Really insightful book that offers much good advice on how

Enjoyed reading it    A well written book  Enjoyed reading it    Great book  I started practicing several principles and already seeing a difference If only everyone lived by these principles   which by the way  I have related the majority of them to Islamic values and principles  we surely would have lived a very different life in a very different society Fundamental Techniques In Handling People   Principle 1 Don t criticize  condemn or complain   Principle 2 Give honest and sincere appreciation   Principle 3 Arouse in the other person an eager want  The book is a series of anecdotes mostly targeting sales professions  I took away a few nice quotes to live by   The grandaddy of them all  the book  not author   Still inspiring after all these years Fundamental truths of human interaction  I recently came across a quote by Dale Carnegie in some literature from my graduate studies and decided to look him up  This book was one of the first things to surface in connection with his name  along with the year of his birth  1888  The year caught my eye because it just so happens that some of my most favorite paintings by Vincent Van Gogh were created that year  I have two of them hanging in my kitchen  as a matter of fact   Fishing Boats on the Beach  and  A Sidewalk Cafe at Night   The year alone didn t prompt me to read Carnegie s book  however  I also happen to be taking on some leadership roles at work this year  and I liked the word  influence  in Carnegie s title  Many of the principles within the book are basic enough and kind of common sense  really  I have already developed many of the skills which Carnegie points out in the workplace over time  But I especially found value in Part 4   Be a Leader  How to Change People without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment   The absolute BEST part of this book  though  The fact that it s over 75 years old  And I devoured it in one sitting   Legitimate   But if you ask Machiavelli or Steve Jobs you may get a different perspective    Highly recommend this book to anyone looking to advance their social skills and personal influence  very good  I read this as a teen and still remember its lessons It s tempting to read this book mainly as a historical document  especially given the old timey  corny  and transparently manipulative anecdotes that fill the book  And a measure of detached awareness like that is appropriate for a book so hell bent on persuading  Still  Carnegie s message holds up well  some of the really good social psych work lately gives good grounding for some of Carnegie s big themes  His greatest insights  I think  are based on how unhelpful it is to treat people as coolly rational  Better  then  to exercise restraint and nurture a measure of skepticism toward hasty judgments about what is likely to win people over  These may not be breakthrough findings  but perhaps David Brent was right when he observed   A good idea is a good idea forever   Dale Carnegie wrote this bible on human relations back in the 30s and almost 90 years later it s as relevant as ever  That it contains basically no anachronisms is testament to both its enduring quality and  frankly  to how these issues are timeless and pervasive of every civilisation  I would go so far as argue that our times are possibly the most critical for such a book  if we consider how cold and disconnected we ve become The only downside for me is that although this is not a long book  it contains so many small examples to back each principle  which in turn revolve around one big unifying concept  that at some point it can become a little boring  Other than that  it s essential reading and  in your own interest  you ll be a better human being for it  A timeless classic on a topic that basically the social psychology of what the title says  A little slow at times with redundant stories  but worth the read  Most of this book is a practical application of the command to love your neighbor as yourself  It is helpful and full of old time stories that are pretty hilarious  Great book  This book was so good to read  So pertinent to my life at this stage  I am trying to graduate college and find a  big girl job  as my husband puts it  This book taught me not only how to cultivate relationships between co workers but also my personal relationships with family and friends  It provides me with specific examples which brought the principle in a whole new light  I would recommend this for all people looking to improve their relationships in life  great book   There are a lot of important lessons here that should be learned by everyone  Unfortunately  the book is sometimes repetitive and sometimes gives advice that you shouldn t use with people that you either have or want to develop long term relationships with  the book is mainly targetted towards people who want to become better salesmen   Still  the book has tremendous value to anyone and should be read by anyone who wants to become a better communicator  which is everyone   Old fashioned but still great advise The title of this book makes me cringe   but it was written in another era  Mr  Carnegie packs enough good tips and timeless meat inside to keep him relevant many decades removed from the first print  Basic stuff that everyone should know in their early years  Good to read around 18   20  Life changing  but hokey at times One of the best books that I read in my life    lzm kl  Hd yqrhmn  jml m qr th fyh ql frnklyn   hm lqw d fy Hyty  n l   trD mbshr an  l  lakhryn  ql mrtn lwthr knj    nny  Hkm  l  lns

years and others I m working on  I liked the many real life examples used to enforce the points  Rarely would I think that literature of this variety would hold up from a 1936 release but in the case of Carnegie s book  it definitely has  I can t give it the full five stars for one reason  Mainly  and essentially  these are people skills but you are  working the crowd   While they make work and many are effective and good practices in conversation  without any degree of sincerity you will always be exposed for your intentions Taken for what it is  the book is a fun  entertaining read that definitely features some ideas to improve socially  I explored the book to look for ways to break through my reserved  shy side as I looked build relationships and grow my network  I have found that it has helped and I am constantly thinking back to something I came across when I use it in conversation  Hard to beat as far as simple things we can do to improve our social interactions  Great book full of timeless advice  As this was written over 70 years ago  you have probably heard most of the suggestions through some other source by now  but reading them again all together and with real world applications makes the book still worth it  It can get a bit dull in the middle with example after example of how to use the advice  A basic to read book  Old  yes  Old fashioned examples  yes  Old writing  yes  But behind of this there a great powerful tool to life and business Very recommended  I found myself bookmarking a lot of pages  I m a person that s not naturally talented at considering the impact of my communication and this book offers a lot of simple and logical reminders  It would be best used if referred to frequently  perhaps before going to work  with the goal of using the technique throughout the day  I unfortunately haven t made it this far  Several things also annoyed me about the book  It s easy to see how Mr  Carnegie would make a great salesmen but a poor scientist  His language is not precise  using sweeping claims like  everyone likes      and the  evidence  is almost exclusively anecdotal  However  this book doesn t claim to be a scientific study and it achieves its purpose of being a straight forward and practical guide to working on bettering your communication with people   almost finished it  great book  highly recommended Everything seems so obvious   if only it were easy to implement in real life   ktb ydhkr lk Trq lt ml m  lns mn Hwlk    ktb jmyl jdan t lmt mnh lkthyr Fondamentale pour vivre avec les gens   Inutile pour ceux

wisdom  Although the title at this day and age might seem a bit corny  This is a definite classic  While it seemingly takes to a fantasy world of roaring 20 s Gatsby parties  its messages ring true  Also one of those books that elicits comments from people on the train who have read  and apparently take to heart  its advice  have read it long time ago    at that time I needed it  so it did helped me kind of   Although it is very clear that this book was written in a different  era    and because of that most people will have some difficulty remembering the people  events and companies mentioned throughout the book   it is quite interesting to notice that MANY decades have passed and yet we deal with the same issues  the same needs  the same problems The tips Dale Carnegie provides are priceless  because we still haven t mastered them  it seems The book is an easy read  and expands on the underlying concept of each principle Dale Carnegie presents  They may seem simplistic to some  evident to others  but don t be fooled  they still need be to be taught  That is why this book is highly regarded and recommended by so many people  including most successful speakers  Entertaining read  Many concepts in the book are by now standard in every day living  The principles are still applicable up to this time   embarrassed to admit i read this book   in high school  i think  don t remember why  someone said it was good  it s insightful but feels a little manipulative depending on one s motivations for behaving with people as the author recommends  It s a classic   First published in 1937   This is a good book and it has definitely influenced a lot of people  I find it really rewarding and hopefully will endeavour to read it periodically    Mr  Carnegie has illustrated through this book that the act of success is engaging with people in a positive way  using communcation and empathy in most situation  One word   Finesse  I read this in high school and again  when I graduated college and was on the job hunt  The principles seem easy enough but are easily forgotten as well  A good resource to turn to when frustration arises with people and relationships  This book is strange  It doesn t present anything ground breaking  no brilliant or mysterious silver bullet But it does present some very good advice on how to interact with people in concise and easy to read form  with many examples to get the point across  And  some of that advice  while seeming obvious is curiously close to the  becomes obvious once you read about it  category Worth a read  Should have read this book long before I knew how to deal with people  Not saying that I know it 100  even know  but this book is a good reminder of how one should go about making friends and acquaintances   Intinya seperti yang diajari Rasulullah    Do unto others as you would have them do unto you  highly excellent Great principles  This is one of those books that should be re read regularly  helps me to think about the other person view on things  and to be more understanding  It s definitely an oldie  but I have found why it s a goodie     In sales it s easy to encompass the sincerity and humbleness needed to present yourself as genuine  The hard part is to actually take what your showing and truly being that person  Removing yourself fro the equation and making it about your client is truly a special trait that I will start today to embrace and not just sell   A book given to me by Brad Singleton  containing great practical ways to communicate and ultimately lead more effectively  Good principles for getting along with others  Once you ve read all the examples  you can just look at the summaries  A book of help  Although it may get boring sometimes  it s worth the time   Fantastic  Coupled with works from Arbinger and Carol Tuttle  your relationships will improve and your perspective and life will change   This is an amazing piece of work  with some great insights into human psychology  It gives practical advice to change the world around you and help you become more social  Re read this for book club  A classic  Great Book With Applicable Techniques  Everyone should read this book  The world would run much more smoothly  quick gd use It was a very good and helpful read  Corny but good Quotes  The man who has technical

sense of importance  and arouses his resentment   Don t criticize them  they are just what we would be under similar circumstances   When we are dealing with people  let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic  We are dealing with creates of emotion  creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity   The only way on earth to influence the other fellow is to talk about what he wants and show him how to get it    What mistakes did I make that time   What did I do that was right   and in what way could I have improved my performance   What lessons can I lean from that experience    Action seems to follow feeling  but really action and feeling go together  and by regulating the action  which is under the more direct control of the will  we can indirectly

Dale Carnegie  this book is no different  What he says has some quality to it and is timeless  be kind  sincere and think of other people s feelings  But I think he romanticizes what it takes to  pull yourself up from your bootstraps   a phrase I loathe after majoring in American Studies   I bet  Dale  that you  too  stepped on people and put your needs ahead of theirs in your climb to success  It was not all charm  You were also ruthless  How can you not be  Also  I don t think this book reads the same for women  even with the progress of gender equality  Here is some of the advice I was given when applying to the corporate world   don t smile    don t clean    don t bake    don t be too polite  or you will be disregarded as competition and will quickly be seen as a secretary not an equal  We have made progress  but the gender inequality is still a large problem  need i mention salaries    Listened to the audio  actually   I can see why this is such a highly recommended book  Even though it was first written in the 30s  it s still got valid advice for getting along with people and being a positive influence   Still good after all those years After I Read and practice from this book  I can make a friends quickly and easily and increase my popularity  So this is a really excellent book  Even though it boils down to a couple of fairly simple tips  it s thorough in impressing the exact mechanics of these  and they re all very effectual  Written in a very readable manner  i learned a lot from this book  this is a book everybody should read to learn how to deal with people and make them do what you want while they are happily doing it  a little boring but very very useful and i m glad that i have read it RECOMMENDED It s a classic   First published in 1937   Really good book  I found it very useful and I m sure that I will return to it to refresh what I ve read  Most of the principles are acceptable and easy to use for me  but I Know that some people dropped this book just because they found those principles are not the way they can interact with the people  Also what I found interesting that all examples are from old times  well the book is old too   so you can also learn something new about interesting persons from the past  An oldie but a good  with concrete examples and strategies on how to influence people  Get what you want by giving people what they want  More effective that using your positional authority to make people jump through hoops   A simple guide  with simple ideas  Some may even argue that the points that the author presents are beyond obvious  However  applying them to your everyday life is a challenge  Set all doubts aside  and actually practice what Dale suggests  It serves to remove all selfish temptations and motives  and encourages you to be humble  Not entirely convinced  No worries  the author provides many examples to prove his arguments   Very good read and useful tips  Got to read it again because i have forgotten most of the things  However one point  being sincere in all you do  is not forgotten  A well written book  Enjoyed reading it    Many great insights on dealing with people  if I really did everything in this book I would be a better person While some of the anecdotes are laughably outdated and the situations contrived  I can see why this book continues to live on as one of the great books on leadership  Great for personal and professional development I was definitely more interested than I thought I would with this book  It had been on and off my to read list since I was 13  Now that I read it  I regret waiting  Although this book was originally published in the 1930s  it s content hardly leaves that impression  I found my self several times wondering why the author has not mentioned certain events  only to remember that they have yet to happen  Was a tad repetitive  but I did learn a thing or two which was more than what I expected  Poorly titled in my opinion   this book really helped me understand the context of the human mind and how to reach that through a multitude of various events   business  sales  friendship  marriage  and parenting  A must read classic for all  I was initially very skeptical about self help books  but I m glad my husband convinced me to read this  Very interesting  The advice given seems like simple common sense  but these days it seems rarely practised  Good points from the book  always make effort to remember people names  be generous in giving praises and showing appreciation  try to think from others perspective  do not put people in bad spot  I m sure Rasulullah practised all this  I want to try to find a similar book from that point of view  Any recommendation  A few good ideas  I believe it s still useful even after the years  While in the self help topic and with a little outdate style  it makes you think about how you face dealing with people s desires and needs  Surprisingly valid and  modern   Dale Carnegie puts the self image of each person as the most important thing to preserve and the use of possitive thinking as the main tool to reach win win situations  Definitely still valid and deserves a reading to not forget the  basics  of human relationships  It s been a very long time since I ve read this book  I didn t realize how deeply it affected me until reading it a second time and thinking   Wow  I m really living all this   In hindsight  I m glad I read it at an impressionable young age  There is a certain expectation in young males to value things like competitiveness  aloofness  precision   Dale Carnegie slashes through such ideas with a philosophy bent on sympathy  courtesy  and compromise  He is quite sexist  but considering the time period  I won t judge the message by the messenger  The meat of his message seems to be  if you are a selfish person  try selflessness as a tool to get what you want   He does stress the necessity of being genuine  which tempers the  go get  em  attitude  Regardless of its flaws  it is an important work for anyone looking to shore up their interpersonal communication skills  This isn t a book I would normally pick up  but I read it because a job I applied for was looking for people who had read this book and understood its concepts While I feel like it didn t completely change my world  there were no real  aha   moments for me   it was nice to read concepts that you should have learned at a very young age re presented for an adult  For that reason alone  I believe it is a book that shouldn t be exclusively read by sociopaths  While that doesn t sound like a good review  I actually do think this book holds value If you you work in customer service  work in a field where you need to interact with strangers  or you re having a hard time getting along with someone you know  it may be worth picking this up and seeing if it has something to offer you  Great book  Probably worth reading more than once throughout your lifetime  Incredibly focused on empathy  understanding  making the people in front of you feel valued and heard   What drops it a star is that it s sometimes quite patronizingly simple in ways  as it is talking about things we all know  or ought to know  But really the 4 star rating is due to the self help mechanisms it utilizes to get people to buy in  To get people to think that these principles are magical and will change your life unrecognizably  The are valuable tools  no doubt  but they will not alone change your life  and Carnegie intimates that people who are billionaires and visionaries got that way using these as their primary routes to success  I understand that they are useful to help readers  confidence to execute these teachings  and in that way I believe that the book is quite dated  As we have moved forward in society  our standards for satisfaction to believe things has gone up  and as such  the mechanisms that help people  buy in  to concepts will need to be more complicated In that way  maybe in it s day  I would have given it 5 stars  Definitely a recommended book    Great book in the importance of relationships  I would recommend this to anyone in college or just beginning their career   Just a simple book to reveal the critical errors people keep making in everyday communication  Despite the very inviting title  this book should not be perceived as a must have guide to manipulating people since it is clearly not that  Generally speaking  the book is about small tips that we usually forget  It is definitely worth reading   This book had wonderful advice and great modern examples of influence  The only problem is I m not in a leadership role so this is nothing I can practice  All of the directors at my job should read this book  especially my boss  Very enjoyable visit to yesteryear  when people were decent  This was a re read for me  lots of good things to be reminded of It was great again  and I enjoyed it as an audio read  I had heard of this book numerous times since I have started my professional career  I was always weary of it due to its title  made me feel like it was a book about how to manipulate people  However  many of the ideas and actions that Carnegie puts forward in this book are just common sense if you want to have flexible  positive relationships with other people  Hints for interpersonal relations in that book that I have long known to bring others joy  such as using their name  or giving a sincere complement are easy to start implementing in your life  Some of the others that Dale puts forward are a little harder  This is a read that everyone should experience  and try some of the things suggested  If anything  its a fun social experiment and neat to see how your relationships effect your own life   Lot s of things everyone should already know  In general be patient and listen more than talk  A well written book  Enjoyed reading it    A must read  I need to read this at least once a year     common sense stuff but so true   useful it begs to be revisited often Muito interessante  as vezes um pouco exagerado em algumas ideias mas tem um valor incrivel de pesquisa  A good book for its time  A little too  Peace love and happiness  for me to give it a 5 star  The  positive  emotions are well and good  but there is a reason we have  negative  emotions  Though  Dale Carnegie can be forgiven  being that the concept of emotional intelligence had not been developed yet  I do enjoy the fact that he clams to have gathered all the science of the time in aid for his book  It s like a snapshot of psychology in the 30 s  to give you a feel for that the biggest psychologist of the time was B  F  Skinner  All in all it was a better book of history than a book for winning friends and influencing people  Though  if the latter is your objective then this book wouldn t hurt  ry   bm n  lklm   lTlm knt tjnb hdh lktb bsbb lSwr  lslby   nh nh mthl ktb lbrmj  l Sby  w my rf b NLPwknt stGrb jd wjwdh

best seller du management qui est en fait un manuel de communication pragmatique aux visees tres generales  sans doute un des pionniers du developpement personnel  La duree de vie des ouvrages de management est relativement courte  du fait des transformations des entreprises et de leur adaptation a un univers macro economique et societal changeant  Aussi  la longevite exceptionnelle de celui ci  soixante dix ans deja  peut apparaitre comme une gageure de qualite  du moins l editeur avance cet argument de vente L objectif affiche est d aider le lecteur a travailler sur sa relation aux autres et a desamorcer les conflits de la vie quotidienne  L auteur croit en la motivation par le partage  l altruisme et la confiance  il bannit les ordres brutaux  les sanctions aveugles  la menace  le management par la peur  Le livre se structure en une trentaine de lecons tres pragmatiques  abondamment illustrees d exemples tires de l Histoire ou des experiences de Dale Carnegie et de ses eleves  Carnegie a etudie et experimente la psychologie et le comportement humain pendant des annees afin de decouvrir les facteurs permettant a certains leaders exceptionnels de tirer ceux qui les entourent vers le haut  Apres avoir enseigne pendant des annees et a des centaines d etudiants les conclusions de ses recherches  il ecrit le present ouvrage  synthese de son travail Le livre est tres accessible  applicable a toutes les situations sociales  professionnelle  familiale  etc    et oriente vers une utilisation pratique immediate  Il est cependant assez bien argumente et souvent divertissant  Meme si l auteur s en defend  on ne peut s empecher d etre gene par une approche    truc et astuces     qui s attache a inculquer des comportements efficaces envers l autre  plutot que le changement d attitude profond pour lequel plaide pourtant Carnegie explicitement  L auteur souhaite en effet livrer des techniques clef en main  et on ne peut s empecher de penser qu un travail approfondi sur soi et sa relation aux autres serait un complement interessant  sinon indispensable  a la lecture et l application de l ouvrage  Pourtant  la lecture de    How to win friends and influence people    ouvre bien des portes a celui qui a la volonte de creuser ces 250 pages  Wonderful book  It s worth re reading  It s easy to read  which was nice  Now to just apply the ideas       It was great but half way through it started becoming a bit repetitive  That being said it was a definitely worth the read as a whole   Fascinating book  I learned more than I expected from this book however from my opinion the concepts in this book can be also used to be manipulative and dissipative towards others so when you read this book you should read it with the intention of becoming a better communicator and not to use these concepts to manipulate other people unethically  Love the book   personally felt the book draws out simple principles about loving people   practical     I try to summarize this shortly The main principle  at least I think  was that try to think from other person s perspective  Everything else pretty much follows  Excellent  Interesting to explain and use examples of things we do  or do not do  naturally  Interesting to also see the synergistic effects that adding these principles have in making other people willing to sacrifice and compromise on your behalf  BE HEARTY IN YOUR APPROBATION AND LAVISH IN YOUR PRAISE  I came across this book while reading an article online  And then found it in the library  Though  I must admit the title sounds a bit manipulating  Even some of the suggestions seem like a manipulating tricks  I think it d depend a lot on the person using these suggestions  For full review follow this link  http

bir tarzi olmasi kitabin daha etkili olmasinda etkiliydi  Guzel bir kitapti diyebilirim   Repetitive at times  Great concepts  a must read for those who work with an array of people   Spoiler alert   it s The Golden Rule Delivered  of course  in more specific techniques for most human relations situations  Such a great book on human relations  This is definitely one to revisit often  This book gives great advice for interacting with others and clearly communicating in an effective manner  I have learned a lot from reading this  Unfortunately  without practice and reminders  a lot of it is forgotten  but this would be a great book to own to be able to refer back to  as the author even suggests to do   There are certainly some good insights and ideas that make a lot of sense  I enjoyed the near constant examples and mini success stories  An interesting  if dated  look into good social skills  Fun to read  if only because you know you re reading a book that so many people have reached for in the past several decades  Thoroughly American in its outlook  too  kind of fun to read through the lens of  What would a citizen of a different country have to say about this book    Easier said than done Dale  I do like this book because it s a reminder to be humble  to listen to others  and treat them with respect  I will always smile to make people feel more comfortable  the book is one of the greatest I ever read No es mi tipo de lectura  sin embargo  es de esos libros que uno sabe que necesita leer y a pesar de haber pensado que no me gustaria  si lo hizo  Ahora solo debo releerlo unas 5 veces mas para recordar y aplicar las cosas que que aprendi con el libro xD interesting insight into the human mind  I ll definitely try to implement some of the ideas   especially those related to conversation making  As an introvert  I m sure these tips will make a difference  After all  he seems to be emphasizing on listening and asking questions more  which seems pretty doable  I m sure that everyone could take a lession or two from this book  I ve taken a new one everytime I ve read it  If your having social trouble  problems at work  even talking to your kids  this book will help  As part of my list of books I should read as an aspiring PR professional  this book offers great insight into principles and ideas that we may already be aware of  but do not fully practice  I appreciate the real life applications and examples of each principle  further coaxing me to see that not only is it ideal  but it is practical  Nothing is too far fetched that it seems impossible to apply  Every idea mentioned in the book can be applicable not only to the professional aspect of our lives  but also the social and the personal The title of the book may discourage some from reading it  because who really wants to admit that they are friendless and need the help of a book  But reading this book is not admitting that you are socially awkward and have no friends  reading this book is acknowledging the fact that human relationships are very complex and there are a few things we need to be reminded of from time to time  A lot of the principles in this book are things that many of us already practice in some form  it s just a great read for further improvement  It is not about learning how to manipulate situations to your favor  it is about learning what it means to be a genuinely kind person and how it makes business and personal relationships better  Great book for understanding people and learning communication skills  dibaca waktu

rw  m qr t f  Hyt  wl lh  Hd  hm l sbb lHb  lqr   As you can tell by the author  this book was written quite some time ago and several references are out of date  However  the book is a quick and interesting read  The general attitude and personality of the public has changed a bit since the 1930s and  as a result  not all of Carnegie s lessons are applicable  But  the essence of this book is still good and useful   A fine book  and even though a lot of the ideas in it are things most readers will have realized themselves  Carnegie presents his findings in such a fun and detailed way that it is enjoyable to read even if none of it is new to you  Should probably be required reading in high school as well  A great beginner s guide to understanding inter personal intelligence   Help you to connect to people and improve their lives because of you tapping into their belief  A fantastic book about using humility to deal with people  though honestly  you can tell a healthy and wise person by the fact that you don t need to use these techniques with them  Very  very good  Give very truthful tips to make a difference in yourself and others around u  An absolute must read if you are interested in productive relationships with people  It s short and easy  and it as some really good insights about human nature psychology and how to deal with people  I liked it  I didn t think I d like this book because I thought the title was a bit cheesy   like maybe it was for those who have trouble making friends  but it really was a good book  So much wisdom from beginning to end  Good points were brought up that made me think   I learned a great deal from this book  about the way people think and work  and how to get them to think and work for your benefit      mqtTft mn ktb kyf

indeed  It sure will make you act in a different way   incredible book  I am not a big fan a non   fiction  but I love this one  According to me  this is this the best book ever written on human relationship and communication skill  I must have read it several times and I always find something interesting every time  It may not appeal to people who are young and yet to see the realities of life  but for those who have flexible and mature mind  this book is not to be missed  However  you must never use the formula of the book because that will not work  if copied  The author provides an alternative thought that should be explored before you decide your action based on impulse or commonsense  It s an easy read with good principles to follow in any given situation  Some of it may seem like common sense  but it explains that common sense and why it is good to practice it  It will show you how to become a much better people person  even if you re not a people person to begin with  Read it       Though it suffers from a bad title  which makes it sound somewhat malicious  I found this book to be just the kind of no nonsense advice I needed for learning to be a conscientious and thoughtful person  It really helped me to consider the world from the other persons point of view   and was a major turning point in helping me create better relationships with those around me   loved the advice  really taught me better ways to interact with others and how to speak more respectfully  I wish the title were different as I find it to be a bit misleading   the book is not about manipulating others This should be required reading  Excellent  it s a very good book  I first read this book in ninth grade  and it influenced my whole personality and outlook on life  A masterpiece and a must read for everyone  Even if you are not a top notch Forbes 500 manager  This is an excellent treatise on interpersonal relationships  and one that has stood the test of time  A simple  unpretentious book filled to the brim with social wisdom and packed with anecdotes  You could say that much of what is written herein is common sense  but if it is then we take it for granted because far too many people are lacking in good manner  If everyone made an effort to apply these principles in their daily lives then I have no doubt that the world would become an infinitely more pleasant place  Now  some people accuse Dale Carnegie of being shallow and manipulative  but I didn t get that vibe at all  In fact  he repeatedly makes a point of stating that you should not be reading his book if your intention is to take advantage of people  The core message is that to make a friend  you must first  be  a friend  Most of the book is spent discussing how to look at the good in every situation and become a friendlier and more polite individual  how to be a good listener  how to sympathize with the viewpoints of others  how to avoid causing unnecessary offense  conflict  etc Still  there are two key things to remember when reading this book  One is that all interaction must be sincere and come from the heart  shallow flattery will only backfire on you  and the author says as much in the book   if you truly have nothing nice to say to a person  either be open about it or don t say anything at all  Be honest  not manipulative  The other thing to remember is that some people  a small minority  are just impossible to deal with regardless of how diplomatic you are and these principles only apply in full when interacting with someone of sound and sober mind  alcoholics  drug addicts  paranoid schizophrenics etc  may have trouble appreciating and reciprocating your efforts at geniality  this little caveat is not mentioned in the book   That aside  I m of the opinion that this is one of those rare gems that should be taught in public schools  and it s worth keeping a copy around the house  This book is something to keep around to read and re read This book is one I like to revisit often  The teachings are timeless  This book is one of the greatest classics of all time  It changes lives for the better as it s been doing for many decades  many different languages and many different countries around the work  A must read   A great treatise on how to communicate with people  Worth the read  I think that these principles can still be applied to today s culture  The information was very relevant to both business and personal relationships  I actually had this on audiobook and it was easy to follow   A book must read    This is the most practical book in the art of dealing with people  I have used some of the techniques mentioned in this book  And they really work  I highly recommend this book for people out there who think they have a leader in them  My dad made me read this  God bless him  when i was in middle school   and it s amazing how much it has  influenced  me without my realizing it  I would encourage reading it a second time for those of you who read it years ago  Just simple  straightforward good sense   One Word  Life Changing  Pretty much the basics on how to be a decent  kind human being  Human  is the most complex living thing to understand  Everybody wearing a necklace says  Make me feel importance   Dale Carnegie fills his book with many interesting tid bits and stories  He makes the book enjoyable to read while providing useful life lessons Age Recommendation  20 Suggested Audience  Anyone in Business  Politics  or anyone else wanting needing to learn some good life lessons  This coupled with the teaching self government skills taught in the building a house united book by nicholeen peck are so inspiring  I can parent without force  and heal relationships by changing me in the most Christlike ways  It really is me not you when it comes to success in dealing with people  Amazing   Excellent book   I learned a lot about people and how they operate  I could read this 100 times and still find new things to apply  Although you may think this book would be business speak tripe  it was one of the best books I ve ever read  It is full of obvious  common sense type stuff  but the principles are things you don t spend a lot of time thinking about  I got so much out of this book that this was my second reading  I strongly suggest it to anyone and everyone  mn lktb lty thrt fy shkhSyty jd  wnSH bqrth  It really influence me  Amazing  fDl ktb qryth  n lt ml m  lns  nqdhny mn  zm  Ignore the tittle  read the book   Offers immense insight good stuff mate Another essential book for anyone who wants the ability to deal with people well   When you are reading the book you may think that it talks about obvious stuff  But these are the things pretty much all of us neglect to do  or just don t know how important they can be  All in all I enjoyed reading it  learned a thing or two and will try to apply some of those to everyday life  Maybe it ll help  Who knows  at least it was an interesting insight into human psychology  Great book that actually teaches you how to talk to people and be effective at it  A book that you constantly refer back to and constantly re read  Recommend   A classic must read for everyone who wants to get along with others  Amazing book that really opened my eyes to the way people can influence each other  I would say this is a must read for any decent human being   Easily a five star read  This book should be read by everybody at least once  Maybe everyone should read it at least once a year  I absolutely loved this book  I didn t exactly know what to expect when picking this up but I had high hopes  and those hopes were greatly met  The book is emphasizes all the little things that you almost never think about when interacting with others  How To Win Friends    Is filled with common sense topics  yes  but in an age where sense isn t so common anymore it is a great read for anyone and everyone   A must read for everyone Everyone needs to read this book  Highly recommended    I honestly think everyone should read this book   Many ideas are well known to anyone  but what I liked that they are organized in principles and you can remember them and apply them to any situation  I liked the way of telling stories to explain each principle   This book will be a good start to change your attitude towards people     if you do the results are amazing  I picked this book up because it s been in print for about eighty years  and I wanted to know why  Here s why  it s brilliant  and it might change your life The title suggested to me that it might have a lot of sneaky tricks to try to get ahead  The book is actually more about being a decent human being  with success being one likely positive outcome  It could just as well have been titled  Have You Tried Not Being a Self Involved Jackass I found the first chapter  about how absolutely pointless it is to criticize people  to be particularly provocative  I try not to criticize much  but I could still do it less  I loved this passage  Do you know someone you would like to change and improve  Good  That is fine  I am all in favor of it  But why not begin on yourself  From a purely selfish standpoint  that is a lot more profitable than trying to improve others  yes  and a lot less dangerous  Carnegie is a clear and persuasive writer who uses anecdotes to good effect  His chapter titles read like modern clickbait article titles  for instance   If You Don t Do This  You Are Headed For Trouble    It s an engrossing read  and I m already finding opportunities to put the principles of his book into practice  This is an absolutely timeless and fabulous read  Dale Carnegie truly was a man ahead of his time and I feel so grateful to get the opportunity to learn his teachings through this book  There are so many passages that I have copied from this book and hung on the walls of my cubicle area at work  I love looking up and reading them to remind me of those things I m working on Although I use these principles in my work life I find I use them much more in my personal life  Especially when dealing with silly little disagreements  where I would normally argue how I m right regardless of how it is affecting other people  Reading this book really helped me to recognize that automatic response to argue and prove our points so that I m able to refrain from such behavior when it isn t even remotely necessary This is a book that is meant to be read multiple times  So much great information that you ll never retain it all in one read Highly recommended     I first read this book years ago when I took a management position  Even though I quickly decided that management was not for me  I have re read this book over and over  The principles make sense and I have had success with them  The problem for me is that I keep slipping back into my old ways  so I need a refresher  This is an amazing classic  If I could follow even half of the lessons from this book consistently I would be a much better person  I try to re read this one every year or so to remember what I need to continue to improve on  Powerful  Good for everyone   Warren Buffett which owns almost 67 billion USD remarked in his book  Warren Buffett s Management Secrets  that he began with this book  How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie  and later on it became his  Bible     the natural and universal truth about dealing with people can be found in this book     nobody could and can live alone  but with others     it is about the  how  whom we are dealing with    All time classic  If the readers are having a hard time talking to other people the book is a must read  A must read for not only entrepreneurs  business owners  network marketers  but everybody     La edicion que tengo del libro de  author  Dale Carnegie  lleva impreso en la portada  22 000 000 de ejemplares vendidos   y se puede definir como un manual de las relaciones personales  Un titulo mas adecuado al que tiene seria el de  Como tratar a la gente   No contiene formulas magicas  ni grandes secretos  si no solo mucho sentido comun  Su contenido se estructura en cuatro partes Tecnicas fundamentales para tratar a los demasSeis maneras de agradar a los demasLogre que los demas piensen como ustedSea un lider como cambiar a los demas sin ofenderlos ni despertar resentimientos  Everyone should read this book  Excellent read  The principles seem like common sense until you hear them applied in the examples  If you want to be a more effective leader  this is a must read  The lessons may seem basic  but the practical applications and Cargenie s overall positivity make this a great read  Incrivelmente util e extremamente revelador  Uma ferramenta de defesa e ataque indispensavel sobretudo para executivos  politicos e outros profissionais que dependam de relacoes interpessoais para o seu sucesso  Any fool can criticize  condemn  and complain   and most fools do  I was skeptical  but this book really is a classic  The grand daddy of all self help management book seems just as sage today as I m sure it did 80 years ago      It s basically about the art of the soft sell  psychological judo for handling people  using their own psychology to change their behavior rather than taking them on by blunt force A terrific  fascinating book  I have had a long reluctance to read this book owing to its title  A book on how to influence people seems like an advert made by a snake oil salesperson intended to sell something even more sinister  However this book turns out to be a great delight and quick read  Dale Carnegie offers advice that is neither sinister or pretentious  It does not offer tips on manipulation as most books of similar titles would  The book though lacks any research  that usually characterises modern books on social psychology but makes up for it by offering a healthy dose of anecdotes  It is important to note the anecdotes are of characters set in a different era This book should be a recommended reading for everyone  even more so if you suffer from any form of social anxiety  A fantastic journey into the human psyche  If you wanna know how to better get along with people  read this book  Eighty years later and it this has valuable wisdom  One of great books    must read    it will change how you see other people   This book is very helpful  It helps us to open up our mind and understand others more   A really wonderful book that inspires and encourages Hundred short stories exemplify a few principles that one can use to life a more fulfilled life  to become a better listener  friend  partner or boss Everyone  how well mannered he or she might be  could benefit studying this book and apply its suggestions Those thirty principles separated in four categories might sound very obvious and too simple  this is their strength  As they dont intimidate the reader  but encourages to go out into the world and apply them  test them in the real world    My motivational and inspirational book    This was the first personal development book I ever read  Just after I started in the direct selling business  my manager suggested I read this to help my issues with getting along with people  The results were amazing  While I am still not the best in many social settings  I understand myself better and how people think  This book has wonderful advice on how to be a better person  Characters  4      How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie remains an informational text  therefore  none of the characters have more influence on the book than others  With that being said  Carnegie is able to describe the characters fully and in detail  As he included Andrew Carnegie in one of his arguments  for instance  he wrote about his background by stating   Andrew Carnegie  the poverty stricken Scotch lad who started to work at two cents an hour and finally gave away  365 million      Carnegie 32   The author managed to introduce readers to persons they may have known nothing about  yet his descriptions allow readers to form opinions about Andrew Carnegie and his past  I truly enjoyed reading about the diverse characters Carnegie includes in this book  in that they each have a story that relates to forming better relationships in life  In many instances throughout the book  the characters eventually end up changing in one way or another because of a key concept described in the book  Specifically  a man named Ken Nottingham  an employee of General Motors altered his approach to addressing people as he is quoted relating   The only difference was I noticed her name tag  I smiled and said   Hello Eunice   and then told her what I wanted   Carnegie 78   Nottingham found that straying from his normal life habits benefited him by relating to a woman who was serving his food  Language  5     In this informational text written by Carnegie  his language throughout the book can be described loose and free flowing  In other words  Carnegie s language is not restricted to orthodox approaches in formal writing  The language remains heterodox  for instance  when Carnegie uses questions to appeal to readers as he relates   Could my opponents be right  Partly right  Is there truth or merit in their position or argument    115   The author s use of interrogatory statements affects the overall language of the book as it creates a mild mood  As Carnegie s tone remains persistent  yet considerate  his language enables readers to connect with the text as he portrays himself as having problems with human relations similar to many other people  A clear example of the role slang plays in the text is revealed as when Carnegie writes      the name will work magic as we deal with others   79   The implication of magic playing a role in the situation is not in fact meant to be translated literally  yet its point is evident as a reader knows it means a benefit is to follow  When reviewing language throughout the book as a whole  it is quite effective in terms of relating the main idea  Carnegie s smart choices in language do not go unnoticed when he directly addresses readers by writing   In preparation for this meeting  ask yourself some hard questions   115   In this excerpt  Carnegie specifically addresses readers as his loose language includes the use of  yourself  to empower the reader  Naturally  language plays a major role in the effectiveness of an informational book  and Carnegie managed to appeal to readers through the use of entertaining  unconventional language  Information  5       The main topic as described in detail by Carnegie remains finding and applying methods to better relate to people throughout one s life  To clarify  the techniques within the book are meant to guide readers in forming healthy interactions and relationships  In particular  Carnegie offers effective information as he explains the importance of a smile by conveying   Especially when that someone is under pressure from his bosses  his customers  his teachers or parents or children  a smile can help him realize that all is not hopeless that there is joy in the world   69   Carnegie relates the imapct a single smile can have on a person  which provides useful information for a reader who might feel obligated to help someone find joy in their life  The book could not have been written as a story with a plotline in that Carnegie s points are categorized into four distinct sections about human relations with no chronology to other examples  The impossibility of a plotline in Carnegie s book is evident while he explains how the information for the book was obtained by relating   I read everything that I could find on the subject everything from newspaper columns  magazine articles  records of the family courts  the writings of the old philosophers and the new psychologists  Clearly Carnegie could not have imagined a chronoligical method to provide structure to his points because they stand as historical facts and information  Theme s   4     The author s main message as clear after reading the informative text  remains the idea that problems occurring within human relationships can be improved through the use of techniques designed to appeal to a person s feelings and motives  To clarify  Carnegie reveals this theme through real life examples of where these fundamental concepts are utilized to improve relationships  Specifically  he provides an explanation on the negative effects arguing has on relationships as he relates   I not only had made the storyteller uncomfortable  but had put my friend in an embarrassing situation   Carnegie 110   By describing his first hand encounter with argumentation  Carnegie realized there were better methods available for approaching another person than by arguing  With that being said  the book is really about uncovering ways to better oneself from a moral standpoint  In particular  Carnegie states the extent to which many people have become self concerned by explaining   We are incredibly heedless in the formation of our beliefs  but find ourselves filled with an illicit passion for them when anyone proposes to rob us of their companionship   119   As he refers to a person s inability to change  Carnegie reveals the main idea behind the book in that one must strive to better their interaction with others by first improving their own flaws  Additionally  the title of the book hints at the theme as it refers to making friends and having a greater influence on others  The importance of the title is explored as Carnegie writes   The survey revealed that health is the prime interest of adults and their second interest is people  how to understand and get along with people      xvii   By including this statement in the text  Carnegie supports the relevance of the title and overall message of the book that a prime concern in a person remains their desire to be important as well as influential from a social perspective Personal Response       This book was truly interesting and helpful to read  as I enjoyed learning the numerous techniques that can be used to better communicate with others  Particularly  I am hoping to apply many of the concepts that are explored in my everyday life  Additionally  Carnegie wrote the book in such an effective way  and his examples remain very easy to interpret  I would absolutely recommend this book to a friend in that it can provide him or her with valuable knowledge they might not have ever come across before  By and large  How to Win Friends and Influence People is a phenomenal informational text with many valuable tips on how to improve one s social life and live more freely amongst others  All of the recommendations in this book seem like common sense when you re reading it  But a bit harder in practice      Great and easy read  This book should be read by everyone  It is full of important information that everyone can benefit from  Its most important feature is its combination of well formulated principles and carefully selected life stories  These stories well illustrate the principles and also make the book very interesting to read  Its style is like  tell stories  make a point   I was really surprised as to how much this book matters and how much I learned by reading it  Yes  some of the advice may be obvious  but it brings the correct way in which to interact with others to the forefront of the mind and that s why it s so valuable  As corny as the title might sound  this book should be a must read on everyone s list  After reading this book I am surprised that schools do not teach the simple principles methods for youth to get along with each other and have less conflict  This book is a classic and I believe it has stood the test of time  The information provided works just as well today as it did when it was written some 70 years ago  What motivated people 70 years ago still motivates them today  What worked on making friends and influencing people 70 years ago still works today  Any person going into any sort of business must read this  The advice this book provides is more applicable than a college education on business  IMO   While reading this book  I have already had a lot of success  whether it s dealing with colleagues  friends  or family  This book was enjoyable and easy read  Este libro necesita que le pongan un nombre distinto  Algo asi como  Recomendaciones basicas de como tratar con personas De entrada este libro parece que fuera de superacion personal y todos los que no se lo hayan leido van a pensar que lo es hasta que se lo lean Para spoilear un poco  en el prologo aclaran que este libro es producto de una investigacion social acerca del segundo campo  despues de la salud  sobre el cual los adultos mas desean aprender  Lidiar con personas Es probablemente el libro mas revelador que me haya leido pero curiosamente es revelador de unas verdades muy evidentes y accesibles  O Yo me volvi fanatico de esta secta  o realmente es util  Valuable advise that can help in both career and personal life  A  does what it says on the tin  book  The techniques can be understood and put into practice easily  but as Carnegie warns  what a person will get out of his book depends entirely on the effort and commitment they dedicate to the practices explained I felt the chapters were just the right length to get the points across and give real life examples where they have been successfully implemented to encourage the reader without it getting tedious or feeling like they are being lectured  The only issue I had with it was that the view of all humans was very cynical  that we are all egotistical and selfish  which of course isn t always the case  though perhaps true 95  of the time     Excellent book on relationships and getting along with people  I read it a few years back and listened to it as well  Very sound advice   especially for those who have a tendency to drive people away from them by their actions and their words  I really like the advice from this book  Fantastic listen  fantastic brainstorming  Wish I owned this and could pop it in for a refresher from time to time  Anecdotes are timeless  Can t believe I never  read  this before  Great practical advice  Easy read  Will definitely reread   A very good reading  It shows basic guides to  treat with others  to be likeable  to be persuasive and to be a motor to change behaviors and get people focussed in the accomplishment of punctual objectives Highly reccomended to everyone  as everyone has to treat with others  but specially to business people  sales persons or managers Despite of being an old book but it covers alot of tips that will lead you to handle people successfully especially in the business world  Very interesting for people who are willing to develop their interpersonal skills   A classic    It s an amazing book indeed  And also I am writing my first review for any book ever  I was depressed thinking what is wrong with me  It made me to think actually what is wrong with others  Why they do what they do  It made me learn how to look at the life from a different perspective  Author tried to make the reader to understand the psychology of the other people  But besides these I have understood the psychology of mine when I had lost  myself  for a long time  This is a very practical  general common sense guide for interpersonal behavior of all kinds  Like all books of this kind  it s not a miracle cure  and some of the suggestions would only have limited effectiveness in the present day  It is nevertheless a quick and extremely insightful read  I recommend this book to everyone who s never read it  and I ll definitely read it again   This book is great  It teaches you how to get along with people better  and how to be less selfish in conversation  Everyone should read it  Nothing revolutionary here  but the point of reading it  or listening to it on audio as I did  are the important reminders about listening and paying attention to the interests of others  Even though the anecdotes are from many years ago  they could not be more relevant especially in the digital age   very useful Often imitated never duplicated  Amazing book to help you with people  I enjoyed the  do this  and  don t do this  sections  Very straight forward  All time classic  The ideas expressed in this book are timeless  This book can literally transform your life as you realize that most of the things Carnegie talks about are very true  It helps you in interacting with people  and developing new relationships  I would recommend this book to anyone  This book is a must read for anyone who is into Networking  This book gives lots of useful information that can help with understanding the nature and the art of meeting people  The information is good to read and also good to know  Carnegie approach simple and common sense read and re read many times  sooooo much good stuff in here  Great book  Timeless  I read it about 10 years ago and use the principles    will re read it again  It amazes me how the exact same book can arouse so many different feelings in all of us  Some people like it so much  they are quite surprised about a simple book written so long ago  While others are so sickened by it  they take the time and trouble to write and let everyone know not to read this book   in an attempt to of course  saving them their valuable time  Well   here are my two cents I love this book and its contents     and I like it more each time I read it I definitely can say that this book affects me different according to my own life experiences  If I have been in the giving end or the receiving end  I definitely can connect with all of these recommendations and I agree totally as to why we should do it    it sure makes sense to me  I can see why What is hard is to practice it  My own nature comes up first and I tend to respond too quick without thinking it through and how that action may come back to me  like a homing pigeon  eventually  Just as when I say something that I regretted right after I said it I think you should read it  few times  and make your own opinion  so  go ahead and get it and read it  I am telling you  you will love it    maybe  If I only can recommend one book to you  I will definitely recommend this book  How to Win Friends   Influence People should be read by all people  It teaches us the basic of human relationship  how to make friend with others  Some good quotes from the book  You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you    Any fool can criticize  complain  and condemn  and most fools do  But it takes character and self control to be understanding and forgiving    Invaluable  Must read  Magical  Effective  I loved this book  I intend to re and re read this without end  Don t pick it up unless if you have a desire or are interested in getting a desire to be better with people  A big desire  A burning one  And you must be willing to apply it  I frequently found myself excited when I finished a chapter because I d immediately try it and more times than not it worked  Wonderfully  no book was more useful to me than this book my relationship with people improved a lot because of applying its theories or recommendations i wish everybody read it  A must read for everyone  for all walks of life  The book really impressed Luke  The BEST business book ever written   by far    For anyone in Sales or in busuiness  you have to read this  Great book but following the advice is a lot harder than just reading the book   The best book I ve ever read to date  hands down  How to Win Friends and Influence People details the essential guidelines of effective Human Relations  Every paragraph uses real life examples of the principles in practice to be used as evidence of the principle s effectiveness  One of the principle s in this book was under the chapter  How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking  and it was to try honestly to see things from the other person s point of view   There is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does  Ferret out that reason  and you have the key to his actions  perhaps to his personality   This quote is one of the many key points in this book that was able to alter my state of mind on how I treat people   I learned that success is easier to achieve when you are able to manipulate your relations with other people by speaking in a way that the other person has no choice but to like you  Even when you are at fault  admitting that you are wrong opens the door to an unpredictable amount of respect  While Charles Schwab may not be a role model  his approach in dealing with people sets the standard as an example of how far human relations can take you in life  How to Win Friends and Influence People is probably the most important book I ve ever read  Invaluable advice for your personal life and professional career  This book was first published in 1936 and its principles and techniques for handling people are absolutely applicable today  This is the type of book you can reread every month to keep sharp   Desde Leader Summaries

sold out halls and toured all over the country teaching executives and managers how to manage and lead  By documenting his techniques he immortalized his lessons  told over 200 easy pages in anecdotes and stories from his classes and experiences  If you can get over the fact that there isn t a single Ipad or computer mentioned anywhere  this was the 30s  after all  there s something to learn on every page  Even if you re not in a position of power you can use these techniques in your every day life to improve your social standing  I picked up this book expecting a lot of hot air but I found myself nodding and agreeing with a lot of what Dale had to say  I continue to be surprised by not only his insight and ability to read people  but also by the application of his 100 year old ideas  I would suggest this book to anyone aiming to improve their social skills Please note   introverts may disagree with a lot of what is written here  After reading Susan Cain s  Quiet   a seeming counterpoint to Carnegie s heavy wielding extrovert ideals  you can begin to see a world where it makes sense that not everyone is a guns cocked conversation cowboy  I do think there are strengths to each type of person though  On the subject   Don t Criticize  condemn or complain    B  F  Skinner  the world famous psychologist  proved through his experiments that an animal rewarded for good behavior will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behavior  Later studies have shown that the same applies to humans  By criticizing  we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment  5 And when Mrs  Lincoln and others spoke harshly of the southern people  Lincoln replied   Don t criticize them  they are just what we would be under similar circumstances  15  Instead of condemning people  let s try to understand them  Let s try to figure out why they do what they do  That s a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism  and it breeds sympathy  tolerance and kindness   As Dr  Johnson said   God himself  sir  does not propose to judge a man until the end of his days   Why should you or I  16 On the subject   Giving honest and sincere appreciation    The only way I can get you to do anything is by giving you what you want  17 Dr  John Dewey said that the deepest urge in human nature is  the desire to be important   17 William James said   The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated   He didn t speak  mind you  of the wish or desire or the longing to be appreciated  He said the craving to be appreciated  18 The desire for a feeling of importance is one of the chief distinguishing differences between mankind and the animals  18  There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors  I never criticize anyone  I believe in giving a person incentive to work  So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault  If I like anything  I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise     Charles Schwab  23 On the subject   Arouse in the other person an eager want    The world is full of people who are grabbing and self seeking  So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage  He has little competition  42 On the subject   Become genuinely interested in other people    Yet I know and you know people who blunder through life trying to wigwag other people into becoming interested in them  Of course  it doesn t work  People are not interested in you  They are not interested in me  They are interested in themselves morning  noon and after dinner  The New York Telephone Company made a detailed study of telephone conversations to find out which word is the most frequently used  You have guessed it  it is the personal pronoun  I    It was used 3 900 times in 500 telephone conversations  52  It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others  It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring     Alfred Adler  53  We are interested in others when they are interested in us     Publilius Syrus  61 On the subject   Smile     Action seems to follow feeling  but really action and feeling go together  and by regulating the action  which is under the more direct control of the will  we can indirectly regulate the feeling  which is not Thus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness  if our cheerfulness be lost  is to sit up cheerfully and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there      William James  67 Thought is supreme  Preserve a right mental attitude   the attitude of courage  frankness  and good cheer  To think rightly is to create  All good things come through desire and every sincere prayer is answered  We become like that on which our hearts are fixed  Carry your chin in and the crown of your head high  We are gods in the chrysalis  69 On the subject   A person s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language    Half the time we are introduced to a stranger  we chat a few minutes and can t even remember his or her name by the time we say goodbye  77  Good manners are made up of petty sacrifices    Ralph Waldo Emerson  78 On the subject   Being a good listener and encouraging others to talk about themselves    That kept her talking for forty five minutes  She never again asked me where I had been or what I had seen  She didn t want to hear me talk about my travels  All she wanted was an interested listener  so she could expand her ego and tell about where she had been  80  Few human beings are proof against the implied flattery of rapt attention     Jack Woodford  81 Many people fail to make a favorable impression because they don t listen attentively  87 Lincoln hadn t wanted advice  He had wanted merely a friendly  sympathetic listener to whom he could unburden himself  That s what we all want when we are in trouble  That is frequently all the irritated customer wants  and the dissatisfied employee or the hurt friend  87 Remember that the people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems  88 On the subject   Make the other person feel important  sincerely    If we are so contemptibly selfish that we can t radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get something out of the other person in return   if our souls are no bigger than sour crab apples  we shall meet with the failure we so richly deserve  95  One of my favorites On the subject   The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it    I have come to the conclusion that there is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an argument   and that is to avoid it  Avoid it as you would avoid rattlesnakes and earthquakes  110 A man convinced against his willIs of the same opinion still 111  If you argue and rankle and contradict  you may achieve a victory sometimes  but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent s good will     Benjamin Franklin  112  Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love     Buddha    and a misunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by tact  diplomacy  conciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the other person s viewpoint  113Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right  Even killing the dog would not cure the bite  113  My wife and I made a pact a long time ago  and we ve kept it no matter how angry we ve grown with each other  When one yells  the other should listen   because when two people yell  there is no communication  just noise and bad vibrations     Jan Peerce  115 On the subject   Show respect for other s opinions    There s magic  positive magic  in such phrases as   I may be wrong  I frequently am  Let s examine the facts   118 Few people are logical  Most of us are prejudiced and biased  Most of us are blighted with preconceived notions  with jealousy  suspicion  fear  envy and pride  And most citizens don t want to change their minds about their religion or their haircut or communism or their favorite movie star  So  if you are inclined to tell people they are wrong  please read the following paragraph every morning before breakfast  We sometimes find ourselves changing our minds without any resistance or heavy emotion  but if we are told we are wrong  we resent the imputation and harden our hearts  We are incredibly heedless in the formation of our beliefs  but find ourselves filled with an illicit passion for them when anyone proposes to rob us of their companionship  It is obviously not the ideas themselves that are dear to us  but our self esteem which is threatened   The little word  my  is the most important one in human affairs  and properly to reckon with it is the beginning of my wisdom  It has the same force whether it is  my  dinner   my  dog  and  my  house  or  my  father   my  country  and  my  God  We not only resent the imputation that our watch is wrong  or our car shabby  but that our conception of the canals of Mars  of the pronunciation of  Epictetus   of the medicinal value of salicin  or of the date of Sargon I is subject to revision  We like to continue to believe what we have been accustomed to accept as true  and the resentment aroused when doubt is cast upon any of our assumptions leads us to seek every manner of excuse for clinging to it  The result is that most of our so called reasoning consists in finding arguments for going on believing as we already do     James Harvey Robinson  119 I am convinced now that nothing good is accomplished and a lot of damage can be done if you tell a person straight out that he or she is wrong  You only succeed in stripping that person of self dignity and making yourself an unwelcome part of any discussion  124 On the subject   Begin in a friendly way     If you come at me with your fists doubled I think I can promise you that mine will double as fast as yours  but if you come to me and say   Let us sit down and take counsel together  and  if we differ from each other  understand why it is that we differ  just what the points at issue are   we will presently find that we are not so far apart after all  that the points on which we differ are few and the points on which we agree are many  and that if we only have the patience and the candor and the desire to get together  we will get together     Woodrow Wilson  135 If a man s heart is rankling with discord and ill feeling toward you  you can t win him to your way of thinking with all the logic in Christendom  Scolding parents and domineering bosses and husbands and nagging wives out to realize that people don t want to change their minds  They can t be forced or driven to agree with you or me  But they may possibly be led to  if we are gentle and friendly  ever so gentle and ever so friendly  137 The sun then told the wind that gentleness and friendliness were always stronger than fury and force  142  A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall     Abraham Lincoln  143 On the subject   Get the other person saying  yes  yes  immediately    The Chinese have a proverb pregnant with the age old wisdom of the Orient   He who treads softly goes far   They have spent five thousand years studying human nature  those cultured Chinese  149 On the subject   Let the other person do a great deal of the talking    La Rouchefoucauld  the French philosopher  said   If you want enemies  excel your friends  but if you want friends  let your friends excel you  Why is that true  Because when our friends excel us  they feel important  but when we excel them  they   or at least some of them   will feel inferior and envious  154 On the subject   Let the other person feel that the idea is theirs     In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts  they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty     Ralph Waldo Emerson  158  The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred mountain streams is that they keep below them  Thus they are able to reign over all the mountain streams  So the sage  wishing to be above men  putteth himself below them  wishing to be before them  he putteth himself behind them  Thus  though his place be above men  they do not feel his weight  though his place be before them  they do not count it an injury     Lao tse  159 On the subject   Be sympathetic with other people s ideas and desires     Sympathy the human species universally craves  The child eagerly displays his injury  or even inflicts a cut or bruise in order to reap abundant sympathy  For the same purpose adults   show their bruises  relate their accidents  illness  especially details of surgical operations   Self pity  for misfortunes real or imaginary is  in some measure  practically a universal practice     Arthur I  Gates  174 On the subject   Appeal to the nobler motives     A person usually has two reasons for doing a thing  one that sounds good and a real one     J  Pierpont Morgan  175 We are either men or monkeys   and the choice usually lies with ourselves  176 You may be right  Nothing will work in all cases   and nothing will work with all people  If you are satisfied with the results you are getting  why change  If you are not satisfied  why not experiment  177 On the subject   Throw down a challenge     All men have fears  but the brave put down their fears and go forward  sometimes to death  but always to victory     King s Guard  ancient Greece  187 On the subject   Your own mistakes    It isn t nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your faults if the person criticizing begins by humbly admitting that he  too  is far from impeccable  204 On the subject   Let the other person save face    Letting one save face  How important  how vitally important that is  And how few of us ever stop to think of it  We ride roughshod over the feelings of others  getting our own way  finding fault  issuing threats  criticizing a child or an employee in front of others  without even considering the hurt to the other person s pride  Whereas a few minutes  thought  a considerate word or two  a genuine understanding of the other person s attitude  would go so far toward alleviating the sting  211 Even if we are right and the other person is definitely wrong  we only destroy ego by causing someone to lose face  The legendary French aviation pioneer and author Antoine de Saint Exupery wrote   I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes  What matters is not what I think of him  but what he thinks of himself  Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime   214 On the subject   Praise the slightest and every improvement    The principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the heart  I am not advocating a bag of tricks  I am talking about a new way of life  219  Compared with what we ought to be  we are only half awake  We are making use of only a small part of our physical and mental resources  Stating the thing broadly  the human individual thus lives far within his limits  He possesses powers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use     William James  219 On the subject   Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to     The average person can be led readily if you have his or her respect and if you show that you respect that person for some kind of ability     Samuel Vauclain  222 On the subject   Outro  Teaching masses on dealing with people    The fact that these people  ten or twenty years after leaving grade school  high school or college  come and take this training is a glaring commentary on the shocking deficiencies of educational system  238 Dale Carnegie would tell you that he made a living all these years  not by teach public speaking   that was incidental  His main job was to help people conquer their fears and develop courage  247  This book helps me everytime I read it  One of the most important books in my library  I never stop reading this book  I finished another read through recently  It never ceases to amaze me how a refresher in Carnegie can improve the ways i interact with others   I read this book many  many years ago  I am now old enough that I can say   many  many years ago   Anyway  and over the years I ve read different parts  I think it s a really good book  Especially for times like now  where everyone seems to be so self absorbed and wanting to get your attention and time to talk about themselves  Everyone could always use a little help on how to be a better conversationalist and how to make others feel comfortable around you  It also helps if you have a tendency to be shy  Which I have been and at times still am  I think it s good for any and everyone to read  I can especially think of some people who could REALLY  REALLy use it  I ve had fantasy about anonomously sending this book to some people  Don t we all know folks like that   Excellent book  I wish I had read this a long time ago  It flows well with lots of advice and interesting stories to go with it  Everyone should have to read this book and have a copy in thier collection  The chapter are short and to the point  The examples are very helpful and emphasize the points  Everything is clearly explained and makes for a great advice book  This is a wonderful book  Some of the examples are quite outdated  but they still beautifully illustrate interpersonal relationships  I really need to read this one again   I really kept feeling like  This is truth   when I was reading it the first time  I think the world would be a much better place if everyone read this  Yes  there are parts that are dated but the overlying theme is great  A must if you have to interact with people to achieve anything   Must Read Book  Embarrassing title to carry around  but will make you a better person to be around   9 8 10   phenomenal read  the single best improvement

applies to all aspects of life including home and work  Absolute classic on getting along with people  Some people claim that what Carnegie teaches is how to be dishonest  I didn t get that at all

highly recommend this book for EVERYONE  Awesome book  Probably the best study of the way people react out there  It was a life changing book in the way in influenced the way I interact with others

I would definitely recommend it to those who want to know how to survive in the real world  MUST read  I loved this book   I would highly recommend this book  A great book about life lessons and how to be the best person you could be   A book that tells you what you already know  but does so with examples and categories you can follow and apply in real life  While the content is somewhat dated  the book is almost 100 years old   that doesn t diminish its value   the examples within are of pure human interaction  and while naivette has dropped and resistance to some of the  tricks  within has grown over the course of the past century  the advice is mostly sound Perhaps most importantly   the book is written in an amusing  friendly manner which makes you glide through it  It s readable in a weekend easily  so it s easy to follow the author s advice on re reading it every month until the principles within are embedded in your very way of being  Amazing book  It is not just a book to read

the issue at its core  Most other books talk about low level tactics but this one hits the point home   Always be genuine   truly interested in the other person  keren  keren  keren    Dale Carneige  is a widely famous author  Even in Egypt  here  most of the HR seminars would have his books listed as a  Resource   So  I decided to give this book a try and see what comes up What I really admired about this book  is how Dale at the beginning  provides you with tips about how to use this book and actually apply the concepts  This really captured my eye  It made me take the entire thing seriously I have read the book a while ago  so I dont really remember the topics and how it was divided  But rest assured  that Dale covered most of the aspects of simply  How to be nice to humans   Honestly  it surprised me how simple the techniques he described  yet  I dont really practice them  I guess  being a selfish jerk could sometimes be easier than being the nice cool guy who accepts criticism by the face All in all  I advise most people to give it a read  And I also  advise you to actually take his advise that is mentioned early in the book  This was a good starter book for a socially awkward person like me  I don t follow it to a T  but the ones that I do remember  had helped me well in becoming a more social person  Some of my favorites are  take interest in others  stop thinking about what to say  be generous with compliments  and most importantly  be sincere  I can see how some might think this book can be manipulative  and it can be if that is the reader s intention  This book presents the tool  it is up to the readers on how to use these  tools    Obligatory  mandatory read  Simple tips to relationship One of the all time best self help books EVER    Mr  Carnegie had a real knack for winning over the reader with experiences and anecdotes  instead of the typical lecture being preached to you by some pompous know it all  I have read this at least a half dozen times  The only thing I don t like about this book is perhaps its title  because people think it sounds like a cheap self help book  And i can t blame the author for that  Everyone should really be intentional about improving their people skills  this book can help do that  Excellent book on interpersonal relationships   Much has been written since this book on the topic of influence but nothing new This book covers it all and in a very concise manner Anyone  nay everyone  who would win friends and influence people should learn whatis taught in this book  I had the impression that this was one of those dime a dozen manager inspiration books until I saw it on a Reddit list titled  the book that changed me most  or something like that   and a bunch of people had agreed  So I decided to give it a shot  And I agree  I think everybody should read this  and it s a shame that the name itself has become a bit of a cliche  The content of this book is about getting along with and handling people   not gaining power or bending others to your will  It is full of advice pretty much everyone I know could use   I thought this was an incredible book  I thought that I d have to weed out a lot of antiquated advice  but I can t think of one principle or even story that was inappropriate for today  Much of the advice was stuff that I already knew  but put into context with the excellent concrete examples that he used has reinforced the basics of interpersonal relations  Published in 1937 for the first time  this book is still a pure gold  It contain what some would consider good old common sense  and reminds again and again from various aspects  a very important principle  No matter what we do  where we live  what business we are in  how the world looks like  or how far technology will advance   more than anything else  this is still a world of people  A true self help book for folks who actually can reflect on their own behavior and change  For those who can t don t waste your time as you will never change  you have to read it at least once in your life        best book ever  Everyone in the world should own this book and read from it regularly  Inspirational  Indispensible for anyone looking to build a career in dealing with people   whether its sales  business  customer service  Probably one of the most enlightening books I have ever read  and the audiobook is superb as well   Nothing you don t already know  but it always helps to be reminded   Recommended by my Mentor and this book is AMAZING DEFINITELY A MUST READ  The perfect book for improving your interpersonal relationship skills  Would definitely recommend it to all of my friends and colleagues  Applying even a bit of the principles in that book could potentially make you life a lot better and much more bearable   You just can t beat this book in practicality  Everyone should take a college course  or maybe two  based on this book  The world would be a better place  Great read  I read some chapters more than once I liked it so much  I will probably continue to hold on to this book and read it time and time again  One of the best books I ve ever read  If you know me  you ll understand why I love this book so much  It s easy to read and littered with wonderful examples and stories about the application of Carnegie s principles   Unbelievably easy to read and apply  Remains a Classic still applicable today because we are only human  Simply  a must read  I don t think there is anyone on this planet who don t want read this  I mean subconsciously It is very easy to read  light on the mind and effective in real life  Truly indispensible   whether you re a salesperson  businessman  teacher or just trying to relate to other people a bit better  this book truly does inspire and encourage diplomacy and amicability  It s even written in a easy to read and  understand style so that you re able to process and remember the different techniques  The things I like most about the book is that he gives practical examples that we can all relate to  and then he gives a summarising principle at the end of each chapter  Definitely one of those books  like the Bible  that I can refer back to time and time again  This is the Alpha book of the genre  The style is typical of self help books written in the 1930s  This book  along with Think and Grow Rich  The Master Key System  and  The Power of Positive Thinking  defined the genre  Modern books always go back to these and the new authors may restate what Carnegie  Norman Vincent Peale  Napoleon Hill  and Charles Haanel wrote  but they seldom add any new information  Carnegie s work seldom dips into psychic phenomena as Hill and Haanel do  but focuses on the daily methods of genuinely taking an interest in people  and making your life better by making their lives better  I think these types of books are important  and try to read this one at least once a year  It reminds me of the importance of treating people with dignity and respect  It also gives me a little brighter outlook on the day   its a very nice book This is one of those books you read over and over again  Worth the read  Definitely a must read  in my opinion  I try to read this book  or listen to it  at least once a year because I m still working on everything suggested in the book  Highly recommend this book to everyone age 12  hdh

you want to make better your own individual character  This is one of those books that never goes out of style  It lays on my nightstand and I often re read a chapter before I go to bed  One of the best books I have ever read   recommended to all open minded individuals who are interested in accomplishing what the title suggests  ktb mmtz w   jbtny  mthlth lqSSy   EVERYONE should read this book at least once in their lives  I try to read this book once a year  it is a great lesson of how to think in terms of what others need  I will write a proper review once I have my thoughts best gathered     Fantastic  My first book that inspired me to read  My bible  Dale Carnegie is a genius   A book for life  I want this book to be read by all the humans out there    Superb  I tested it for myself and worked all the time    A book everybody should read  about relationships in general It s not boring and really easy to read  since there are a lot of small stories and interesting facts in it It s a book about  what you should do and what you shouldn t do  in every kind of relationships  friends  family  work  love  etc  It can help to have more smiling people around you  and to have more friends if you need so  but that s not mandatory   so I think it can help YOU to have a better life  It can help you to manipulate  or Influence  like the author say  everybody around you as well to do WHAT YOU WANT Warning  It s not because you know what to do in life  that you will do it  simple  easy enjoyable  It emphasis on many small things that we tend to forget and tell good stories on how to use it  inspiring and helpful  liked it may reread it  All leaders  CEOs  and small business owners should read this book  I was introduced to this book in high school by my mother s best friend  It changed my outlook on people and their personalities   Essential for anyone to read  Outstanding book  To this day it still gives excellent advice  I was skeptical to read another  self help  book  but this was well worth it  One of my current favorites  Good bookthis is timeless good advice for anyone  in business or not  these principles will help everyone have a happier life by minimizing conflicts and promoting harmony  Good common sense  A great classic  must read  Love this book  If you want to change your life  read this book  Enough said  one of the most amazong books that totally influences my personality   Deserves 10 STARS for how powerful this is   Started me off being outgoing Everyone should read this book once a year  I applied all those advices and they were magic  I was a teenager then  and I felt so empowered for what I read  that it has been a unique experience in my life  I think that I read it at the right time of my life  This book should be required reading for anyone who works with other people  I think I will force myself to re read it again   What did I think Silly question It s Dale Carnegie    one of the most fundamental reads for anyone living in Western society where the culture has warped  the mores have morphed and the folkways have blended with the need to have  get  and own  stuff  reputation and money I don t know why I took so long to get around to reading it  Might have saved a lot of agony for me and other people   If all of us would only adhere to the wonderful advice put forth by Carnegie then we would all find our business and personal relationships flourish  After reading  How to Win Friends   Influence People  by Dale Carnegie  I realize that I do the exact OPPOSITE of what is proposed in the book  on a daily basis  and it has been to my detriment  As a result  I am making changes to the way I communicate with my family  friends and colleagues  I know this change will help me live a better life  A must read for anyone trying to do either of the two things the title suggests   win friends  or  influence people    All of the suggestions seem like no brainers  but then you realize that you re not doing them  There is a reason this book is still relevant after so many years  Definitely one to read again  This book has really great tips not only on how to get others to like you  but how to become a better person  I highly reccommend it  About to read the book  fDl ktb fy ltnmy  lbshry  bl mnz  ykfyny  nh HSyl  15 sn  mn l bHth wmy t lmrj    wlys ktb nSy H war mn ktbh   ry   wnSH bh bshd  all these principles are so practical  literally you can apply all of them to enrich your life  help yourself and others  Now I understand the power of church   it is not because the bible  but great people always ready to serve others  also let your kids involve church activities to nurture their virtues and the spirit of leadership  I will read this book again  and teach my son about all these great principles   This book changed my worldview  It is not the greatest piece of literature I ve ever encountered  as far the art of writing is concerned  but it is without a doubt a necessary and priceless component of the personal library of whoever is interested in the study of human relations  Timeless principles to learn and diligently apply in real life  HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE  I believe deserves great respect from us  Only from this book I learnt    You cannot kick beehive if you love honey   Here I trust  beehive means the world of friends and people who are important around us  We all are supposed to live our lives skillfully and not foolishly  We do not live on island  I am writing this because it s so surprising to see a few people criticizing this master work  A work that teaches you how to live skillfully  must not be  kicked   Maybe  rebellious attracts most attention  is the motive behind certain people recording their negative remarks  though full democracy in our current times very much allows that Above all  I had such a pleasant experience with this book  It s not that I was unaware of many things written by Dale  but effectually the words written in a book do make impact  Earlier to HOW TO WIN    I had read a few fantastic books  such as WHAT GOT YOU HERE WON T GET YOU THERE  Tremendous experience it had been altogether  These kinds of books helped me refine as a person  both at home and at my workplace  I began to observe my behavior more meticulously now  I improved a lot  I made progress too  Later on another wonderful thing happened to me  I felt so inspired with new ways of life  that I ended up writing a book myself  It is LEAD LIKE A MASTER  I d figured out generally what stops people from getting five star rating in their both kinds of life  home and workplace   And I poured it all into this book  I am glad to have contributed my bit  I have been receiving many reviews that LEAD LIKE A MASTER is indeed helpful for getting the readers Five Star Ratings  And it s all thanks to the legends like Dale  Marshal Goldsmith and many more who have continued to impress me till date  I wish happy reading to all  even generation to come with this timeless piece of work  Because common sense isn t  Brilliant book about how to manage your inter and intra personal relations  Nice book  I think our lives will much better when we apply these principles though I think the writer is over optimistic but let s try the advices and then judge   But again it s a very nice book Wonderful book  Read it after you haven t read it for awhile and certain passages pop out at you in a new dimension  If your looking for a foundation of speaking to folks and being genuine in your approach  this is definitely a must ready Older book  but lot s of good info  especially for an introvert like me   Carnegie wonderfully expounds on the trivialities of human interaction on every level  time  and place  making the etiquette of socializing simple and easy for anyone to understand and apply in their lives  Great book for those of us who are socially inept  Seriously  I should have known 99  of the things I read but growing up as an only child and being raised by a single mom who also grew up as an only child    lets just say I was a tad socially awkward and lacked basic socializing skills  This book helped me learn some skills to not only interact with people  but to learn how to make myself likable which is something everyone is concerned with right  Towards the end it gets a little bland  for me at least  but overall it was fantastic  Highly recommend to anyone    Heard about this book from a colleague  I felt like I ve learnt from this book and helped to improve my people skills  Certainly would recommend it to others  AWESOME    This book is a classic on human nature  The title is misleading  as it is about how people think and what drives their decisions  A must read for everybody  and I have recommended this book to many former  and now very successful employees  Tons of great advice in this book  Amazing book for all times read A must for anyone that wants to live a better life   First time reading this one  I had always put off reading it thinking it was an old  out of date self help book  I am glad I was wrong and mad I hadn t pushed myself to read it earlier in life  The principles are timeless  but it is the large selection of anecdotes from historical figures that made this really meaningful to me  You can get the principles from Wikipedia if you want the short version  You will miss so much this book offers though in the anecdotes involving Abraham Lincoln  George Washington  General Robert E  Lee  Socrates  Jesus and more  I anticipate reading this book many more times in the coming years because I fully believe that as life changes I will perceive different points to be more relevant or more wise than during the previous reading  I recommend this book for anyone that has a desire to learn and grow  mn  Zm ktb ltnmy  lbshry  wktb ktyr stmdtk mnh lmd  lkhm lltnmy  lbshry  I have always LOVED this book  mn lktb lty  thrt kthyr fy Hyty mndh lSGr it is all by heart    either it s your sympathy  empathy  or even a slight gesture toward the person who look back at you  This is one helpful book The writer is precise and understandable  giving a lot of practical information on how to make yourself a more likable person  and to get people to do what you want  Everyone in the world should read this book at least once a quarter  minimum   An excellent instruction manual for dealing with people in all settings  The techniques discussed range from  obvious  but good to remember  to  wow  I ve been doing the opposite for years   The book definitely gets repetitive  but I think that s the point given that there are a few major themes  e g   empathy  positivity   Bottom line  I can see why this book has been popular for the past 100 years For those who just want the techniques  here is a complete list Fundamental techniques in handling people 1  Don t criticize  condemn or complain2  Give honest and sincere appreciation3  Arouse in the other person an eager wantSix ways to make people like you 1  Become genuinely interested in other people2  Smile3  Remember someone s name4  Be a good listener  Encourage others to talk about themselves 5  Talk in terms of the other person s interests 6  Make the other person feel important   and do it sincerely How to win people to your way of thinking 1  The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it 2  Show respect for the other person s opinions  Never say   You re wrong  3  If you are re wrong  admit it quickly and emphatically4  Begin in a friendly way5  Get the other person saying  yes  yes  immediately 6  Let the other person do a great deal of the talking 7  Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers 8  Try honestly to see things from the other person s point of view 9  Be sympathetic with the other person s ideas and desires 10  Appeal to the nobler motives 11  Dramatize your ideas 12  Throw down a challenge Be a leader 1  Begin with praise

the other person save face 6  Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement 7  Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to 8  Use encouragement make the fault seem easy to correct 9  Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest  I have wanted to read this book for well over 15 years now  It has been recommend by so many  who are much wiser than I am  I now regret that I did not read this sooner  Even though this book was written in a different generation  the principles in dealing with people remain true  Some of the examples in the book are humorous as they are very dated in regard to some sort of technology that might be referred to or a recent president that by the time I read the book has been out of office and even dead for many many decades  The writing is excellent  and made it very easy to digest  I believe this will be a book I add to my yearly reading list  The principles taught in this book are pretty simple  and in some cases rather basic  never the less they are often long forgotten techniques you can use to improve relationships  The main target of the book seem to be people in business  but I think with a little creative thinking these principles work in every situation that involve relationships  I work in the non profit sector  and I see this information being very beneficial for me  I also look forward to applying it and using in working with my children  This really is a good read for nearly anyone   This book is absolutely brilliant  It s surprising how a book that s over 70 years old can still be completely relevant in today s times  But then after all all the technology doesn t change the basic way in how humans behave  feel or think at an elemental level  Read this and start practicing what it says  it will definitely make you a much more sociable and likable person  Must read for anyone Great book  Helps you to pay more attention to how you give and receive in person to person interaction  I wasn t expecting much when I opened Dale Carnegie s canonical business school book How to Win Friends and Influence People  I anticipated a long series of platitudes about power and leadership  but it turned out to be one of the most insightful and enjoyable reads I ve ever had The book is a collection of warm and inspring stories gathered under Carnegie s organizing principles  The principles are presented as rules to live by  and the stories like character building exercises for each principle  It s hard to imagine much of this being taught in today s business schools  as most of the stories teach lessons in generosity  humility  and empathy  One awesome and mind boggling read  Great refresh your self overall and inside out way  Anytime and every time read to up your self   A solid reminder that communication and listening skills are at the center of everything  Thank you dad for recommending this book  Just read it   see the world differently  one of the best books I have ever read   learn to improve your people skills and communication abilities  The book shows signs of its age  making it hard to get through in the beginning  However  once you get over these initial hurdles  it s a wonderful compendium of the  simple things  that will lubricate your social and business life  Highly recommended  Livre audio  J en suis a ma deuxieme ecoute et j envisage de l ecouter une troisieme fois  Excellent  A classic self help book   training for successful communication in all areas of life   it really needs to be reread at least once a year   Great ideas on how to make new friends I am always reading this book  It will always be on my  current reads   and I suggest that it be added to yours  This book covers three topics in detail  how to converse  how to make people like you  and how to lead  For each topic there are approximately 10 principles that the author dedicates a chapter and shows many examples from Abraham Lincoln to a random family applying this rule to great success  Some principles are  Give honest and sincere appreciation  or  Ask questions instead of giving direct orders  I learned many new principles  and for the ones that seemed obvious like  smile   Carnegie convinced me of their vast importance and I m striving to do them better  It s a pleasure to read  and I would definitely read it over again Carnegie actually recommends to do this several times   A good plan to truly absorb all of this information would be to apply a principle a day  It s not the book I expected  Title makes it sound like some cheesy  Hey  it s great to meet you salesperson walks you through his bag if communication tricks  Instead  it s the seminal work on business communication  MANY books have been derived from the concepts taught here  Teaches you how to better connect with people  One if those books I need to re read  or re listen to  every year or so  A book to be read over and over  It is a part of me   I ve read this book and portions of this book over and over for years and years  A good reminder for tact and good interpersonal communications   a lesson everyone can learn and utilize  best book to help in life we all need to be better at relating to people if we want to better ourselves and get the best out of this life the lord gives us here on earth Great tips to help you advance your professional career  There is a reason this book is a classic  It is essentially story after story of illuminating incidents  with insightful comments about how human nature gears people to feel at certain moments and how we can best deal with them  My favorite aspect of this book is that it doesn t over simplify for the sake of having your traditional  5 step  business books  It highlights things like giving people compliments  which may seem obvious  but is insightful when it says that compliments only are meaningful if they are sincere and specifically applicable to the person you are talking too Cons  some dated languagePros  when you read it lives up to its billing as a classic  full of human relationship insights relevant even after a century  Great principles to get along with people  A must read for any aspiring business person  or better yet  anyone who wishes to be an active  successful member of civilized society  hdh lktb hw mjmw   mn lfSwl khtyrt mn  fDl ktbyn l dyl krnyjy  hm  d

struggled socially  I found this book while searching online for advice on not coming across as a pessimist  After reading it  not only am I confident that the techniques and rules in this book will help me defeat my own pessimism  I plan on recommending it to anyone else who suffers from the same problem   People say I remind them of this book  so I must have taken a lot from it  without much doubt  one of the best books i have ever read  With the advancement in cyber technology  people can find information on most  if not all fields of studying and knowledge  What ultimately determines people s success is their people skills  However  that is the very thing the Internet cannot teach you  Open up this book  and you will find all the fascinations about human nature and human interactions  One of the best books I ve read on the subject  The irony is that I lost my best friend while reading it  Wish I had read it earlier    I have read this book more times than I care to admit  It is just a great guideline for being social and likable  A must read classic 1st book on sales I ever read  makes a lot of sense and is still very applicable  Good Book with Good example not just Theory  Very interesting   lots of good tips and insights for dealing with people  I m already trying make habits out of many of the principles  Everyone in the world should read this book This book was excellent  Lot s of common sense ideas to shift your perspective on how to deal with people  Brilliant and inspiring  I literally couldn t stop reading it and wanted to take notes while reading because there were so many good points I didn t want to forget  Dale Carnegie describes events from his own life and his managing people and trying to get people to do what you want by making them think it s what they want to do  I just loved the whole approach of being nice and getting things done that way but I read this book while dealing with roommate issues so my frame of thought wasn t quite open to using the tactics right away  Most comprehensive insight into human relationships and a very thorough guide to becoming an effective leader  This book is of great importance to me  I had difficulties in understanding How to interact with people  This book changed my life in a big big way  Must Read   If you skip the anecdotes  the crap and the historical fallacies  there s a 30 page book of awesome in line  Despite an awkward  creepy title  the best book ever written on getting along well with other people on a daily basis  Have used these techniques for 20  years with success  This book has changed me to become a better person  This book is a must read The top principles that I ve been focusing on after reading this book were   Don t criticize  condemn  or complain   Give honest and sincere appreciation   Become genuinely interested in other people   If you are wrong  admit it quickly andemphatically   Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers   Try honestly to see things from the other person s point of view  Dramatize your ideas   Let the other person save face   Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to   Let the other person do a great deal of the talking  Excellent concept explanation of interpersonal relations and how to improve your ability to  do unto others as you would have them do unto you   Winning is about the result  not about hurting people   Awesome and life changing book  A lot of great tips how to make your life easier  Possibly the best one book everyone should read in school I believe this book can add value to anyone s life and improve social as well as business life A must read if you want to understand practical form of communication  Best book ever that people should read at least once a year  Reminds you the basics that actually are THE basics that also make everything work happen  It amazes me how timeless the advice in this book is  If everyone in a leadership position even did a few of these things  I believe that people would be more productive and successful to a level that would be unimaginable  As it is  I have not seen these principals put into consistent practice in 21st century America  When people do it  the results are still amazing  The problem is  they re only followed out of desperation  It s a little discouraging to see that people are still falling into the same  age old traps of criticism and  power plays  to get things done  It could be done so much better if we played to strengths and not to humiliation or  showing them who s boss   I think this should be required reading for everybody in a leadership position of any kind  and would go so far as to say that they should be challenged to implement at least one part of this book into their lifestyle to see what a difference it could make   If you only ever read one book in your whole life  I think it should be this one  And that s a hard thing for me to say  man  I ve read a lot of REALLY good books    One of my all time favorites  Worth reading multiple times  I finnished this awesome book of Dale Carnegie 1990 s when I was bit over 30 years old  One of the best wisdom book ever     for every

marketing  Thanks for sharing this good book  Great book on how to improve your interpersonal skills  I found that it was a very easy read  the principles outlined straightforward and effective  The thing that makes the book so important is that the right way of handling situations or people is often the exact opposite of the best way  Taking the low road often gets you further than asserting your authority ever could  I recommend this book to everyone who wants to improve   I read this when I started my  adult education  of learning to grow as a person a long time ago  It was and is the best book I ve read that applies to real life  Incredible book  Will read it every year  Everyone should read this book  Read it through twice now  How to Win Friends and Influence People is a classic that should be read by everyone  at least once a year  I got mine in under the wire  but next year I m going to read it once a month  There are so many common sense strategies and tips that don t seem to be as common as they could be     even if you read it previously  like I did  about 20 years ago   I guarantee you will re enrich your life by giving it another read ASAP  The only book my dad ever read  He gave it to me when I was about 8 or 9  I read it cover to cover several times just because it was from him  I really believe it gave me a great head start in life  both personally and professionally  One of the Best books ever written on the subject  Goreshcho prepor chvam  Obshchochoveshki pravila za choveshkite otnosheniia  Za mnogo ot ne znaekh i mi se iska da biakh nauchil v detskata gradina  Definitely a self help classic  A good book to reread and review year after year   A really great book for any person  The title sounds cynical  but the book is not at all  Book that has many potentially life changing topics  Areas of interest are techniques in handling people  making people like you  get people to your way of thinking and being an effective leader  As I have just read this book I dont have any major life changing stories  yet  Although I can see it affecting the way I go about my daily life  interactions with people  and in some way my outlook on life already   Truly brilliant  If you want to improve how you get thing done  this is the book for you  Classic must read  Principles and techniques shared in the 1930 s are still very real and effective today  I rarely give a book 5 stars  but had to in this case  It exceeded my expectations  I m glad I read it  and have already successfu ly used several of the techniques shared  This is a timeless book that simply teaches how to build relationships with people  Dale Carnegie s  How to Win Friends and Influence People  is a non fiction book that details human behavior  it also gives the reader instructions on how to accomplish their goals and truly get the most out of life Carnegie makes a seemingly dull topic extremely captivating  His witty humor entertains the reader while his historical allusions and real life examples prove that his formula for success really works  Carnegie s voice is honest and sincere  He manages to define human behavior from an objective viewpoint  He does not think he is special or lucky  he believes that success is attainable to anyone if they have the right tools  The text is broken up into chapters  each one is compromised of a different life lesson  This helps the pacing of the book and gives the reader places to start and stop  Carnegie s repetition also plays a large role in the effectiveness of his concepts This book has shown me that it is possible to make an advice book really interesting  It will improve my ability to capture an audience s attention even if the subject matter is not extremely entertaining and plot driven  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone  Every reader can gain helpful knowledge and utilize this publication   This is the second time I have read this book yet I didn t think I remembered anything from the first time so when I reread it  I found a whole new treasure chest  This book changed my attitude about people and their behavior  their words  And I made a promise to myself to change  Very influential book for me as a teen  This is one of those rare gems of books that you can t just read once  You have to read it  then re read it again to truly absorb all of the wonderful knowledge contained in these pages  I recommend it for any person looking to improve her  or him self  not just business professionals or those who are feeling like they lack true friends  It is packed full of useful advice that is completely relevant today  despite the fact that this book was originally written so long ago  Keep this in your arsenal of personal development books    Absolutely outstanding and a deserving classic of non fiction as relevant today  as in the era of its conception   and so it will be in another 50 years  Carnegie s narrative is engaging and warm  delivering information that many arguable subliminally  while presenting it in a way that even the most earnest practioner will be inspired to improve upon  I loved how it wasn t a lecture  but delivered kindly and interspersed with many anecdotes of others Including some VERY famous people  and quotes  I honestly don t think that I ve ever underlined a book so much before I can t say enough about its benefits and am forcible ending this review here and now  This book serves as a great reminder that people are  not creatures of logic   they are  creatures of emotion  and that we must remember to treat them as such  However  if you don t the time to read the entire book  I recommend the last section  How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking   It s got many great examples and tips such as   postpone action to give both sides some time to think through the problem  and  get the person saying yes  yes on the outset   Read  Reread  Repeat   Nuff said  A superb book  Really useful in the real life situation I love this book  I m always reading it   Simple ideas about basic communication yet it seems like these principles are not often practiced  A good read  Something that Influenced the Very Core of My existence and my character   I don t know how I came across this book  but the moment I picked this up  I was floored by the writing  The thought process of the author is amazing and the ideas presented are really fantastic and common sensical  We come across the described situation more than once per week and I am sure  that this is one of the book which will make a change in my way of life  Would be amongst those few books I will read more than once I would recommend anyone and everyone to read this book  I agree that most of the teachings from the book are pragmatic in nature and can be followed in life  The most important take away from the book   Change your perception  See what you see from other s eye  Understand why someone did what they did  Appreciate Lavishly   Reading this book gave me so much moment to contemplate  Have many friends doesn t count if you couldn t make them feel comfortable when you re around  We all know how to get the attention  but just few who know how to get attention and respect at the same time  The book may be 80 years old  but the principles are bang on  Simple  easy changes that will work wonders  One of my very favorites and one that I will continue to reference throughout my life   Amazing classic  If you want to improve yourself as a human being then this is exclusively paradise for you I think this book will also arise interest in people who generally don t prefer to read this kind of books  Gold standard  I have probably read this 4 times  need to read it again   brilliant book  with many take aways for everyday life situations one of the best business books I have ever read  because it goes beyond work  to how to live life to it s fullest  I ve never been motivated by a motivational books  This book was the only exception  Usually I don t believe in this kind of books  I found it among my parents books and picked it out of bordem  I would never have bought it otherwise  Maybe the 5 stars tells more about what I was going through   I was going through depression and hated everybody   more than it tells about the book itself  you will never know unless you try it  One of the best books you will ever read  Everyone can benefit from this classic  Emminently readable  Recommended to everyone who can read  Just finished my fifth read of it and am re impsired to live more carefully as I interact with people  By far and away the simplest  most easy to understand book on how to change your life  your relationships  and everything around you  Universal truths that should be required reading in high school and college  Hint  This book isn t about you  it s about everyone around you  Treat people the way you would like to be treated  Excellent book to enhance your skill with people  I will always love this book Goodreads Book Report on how to win friends and influence people Dale Carnegie s first book entitled  How to win Friends and Influence People  was the most eye opening book i ve read in 10 years and the second most eye opening book i ve ever read in my entire life  How to win friends and influence people doesn t only teach you how to influence people but it is in itself a very influencing book and it taught me a lot about what it means to be me as a teenaged male that s never been  Good  with people  it s taught me a lot  I wish I would ve read it years ago    How to Win Friends and Influence People  is simply about how to win friends and influence people  Dale Carnegie is a genius when it comes to the human mind  not scientifically but Mentally  as in he doesn t understand the science behind the brain but understands how others can affect the brain with how they act and speak towards people  this book has four parts to it  Part One talks about the  Fundamental Techniques in Dealing with People   Part Two talks about  How to Make People Like You   Part Three Talks about  How to Win People to your way of Thinking  and Part Four simply tells you to  Be a Leader  Dale Carnegie s  How to Win Friends and Influence People  is a must read for anyone that has trouble making or keeping friends  One of the best books ever  Everyone should read this book  The title can be misleading  It s more about improving yourself and the way you interact with people and how you can do that more effectively  I marked this book up and plan to read it again and mark it some more  If you are an ambitions person  you will never reach your goals if you don t know how to manage people in your life  This book  though it may seem manipulative  provides excellent insight into getting the results you want in any exchange  The lessons are well designed and often communicated through engaging anecdotes  This was my favorite book in college  it just made so much sense with the leadership roles in my life  Absolutely phenomenal       A masterpiece on interpersonal relations  A very practical approach on how to influence people around you    Always good info and the way to be  it isn t about you    it s about others      Changed my life  Looked at myself and everyone around me totally different in a good way  Quick read and would recommend it to everyone  not just those who have having a hard time in life  Boost your communication skills ktb ry   lktb  mlq Fantastic must read book  The Book will only help people who are looking to change themselves  There has to be a urge to bring a changes and progress that s when one can make full use of techniques presented in the books  I have been simply gaining and climbing in my life after i have read this book  I love it to the core and have made notes which i go through every day and since the techniques work it keeps me motivated  Best book you will every read  Read it many times  its great books This is one of the best books anyone can read  It had a great impact on me   This one is definitely a must read for anyone working  and living  with people  The rules are very simple and yet powerful when it comes to empathy  understanding and good business or personal relationships   One of the best books I have ever read  This book should be read on a yearly basis and we just might have world peace  Many people have recommended that I read this book  I am very glad that I listened to their advice  The basic idea behind the book is that is explains how people became successful through making relationships with other people  Warren Buffet  arguably one of the most successful people in the world promotes this book and says that this book helped him accomplished his achievements  The author of the book  Dale Carnegie  suggests that you read it often so that they ideas are in your head  I intend to do so because of the way that this book has already shown results  I am only a sophomore in high school and this book helped me to form relationships with people that I didn t know so well at the beginning of the year  This was attained through using one of the earlier skills of  becoming genuinely interested in people  which seems like a no brainer  but you would be surprised at how well that has worked just by leaving it in the back of my head  Another simple thing that I did was think from the other person s perspective  and think about what they wanted  I have not been able to test out all of these tips  but after what one the tips has already done  I predict that the others will have just as great of an effect  It is amazing how much of an impact you can make on someone by just following the guidelines  Carnegie mentions in the book that there are classes that teach this book and other things involving Psychology  After reading this book  it spiked my interest in Psychology and the way that the human brain works  This book also goes into examples that are very interesting  and give a cool perspective of historical figures  success that I never would have thought of had I not picked up this book  He gives you the perspective of President Lincoln for example and urges you to think of what they would do in that situation  Even if you somehow come across this book not aware of the information it holds  it will still be an enjoyable read  I don t know how it wouldn t because it mentions on the back that it will go into how to make people like you  win people to your way of thinking  and to change people without arousing resentment I would recommend this book to everyone because everyone could always improve their social skills  Since my reading of the book  this has been the most beneficial book that I have ever read  and I haven t even tried out half of the things Carnegie put in there  I could see this information being helpful after high school  into college and for the rest of my life  Many people praise this book as being one of the best books that will lead you to success  and I 100  agree with them   It s a really good book It doesn t teach you how to win friends and influence people by showing you the literal way of making friends I believe it approached the topic on a different perspective  Moreover  i doesn t only change the way you make friends it also encourages you to change yourself for the better it is somehow a self help book on improving one s personality and at the same time teaching you to win friends It s a great book and I recommend everyone to read this  It s those kinds of book that can somehow restore humanit of everyone can only read this  You know  it s incredible that people don t know the things in this book  It s amazing  What is further amazing is how odd I feel even doing the simple things that it says  How far gone has society gone  One of the important things illustrated in the book is to use people s names when talking to them  It makes sense  It connects you to people  People love the sound of their names  But why is it so difficult  I go to the bank and I want to say   Thank you  name of teller    have a good weekend   but I can t do it  I feel like I m not supposed to use her name  I don t know her well enough  or she ll think I m being too personal  How is that possible  I m trying very much to get back into the game    be how I d really rather be  It s just difficult because everyone is about personal space and texting  No one talks to each other anymore  It s sad  I can t believe how much I learned from this little book   I didn t know what I didn t know    Chris Brady  All time top 5 must read and implement books  Very good book  Very useful to anybody  After I reading that book  I learned a lot on how to improve my inter personal skills  The main point that I learned from the book is not to criticize anybody and If you want to pinpoint mistakes  you have to highlight the good things first and then let them know the mistake is a easy one to correct  I have not been doing this before  This is a  must read  for everyone  Yes  the concept is very basic and we all  should  know it but really  we don t  You won t regret reading it  Some of the examples and stories are dated but what do you expect from a book written before the 1930 s  Get past that and everything else is very relevant to today s business world  My children will not leave the house without reading this book  its good if people apply it  if i have reached till this level its bcoz of influencing people  ideologies and etc This is a timeless classic for anyone interested in leadership   One of the best books I ve ever read   Go grab a copy NOW    You ll forever REGRET not having to read this book  This will change your life in ways you can t possibly

 Very easy to read and relate to  Supported with good examples  I recommend it for anyone to read  I read this book in high school and there s a good reason it s a business and self help classic  Dale Carnegie has influenced my dad s generation and mine  This is the best book I love ever  It has a huge positive influence on me  I got the Chinese version in the year 2005  when I just completed my national examination for college  After reading this book  I decided to get involved in college activities even if I was very shy at that time  I felt great with a lot of friends in my undergraduate years  and I know most of them from various events  This book helped me so much  I appreciated it a lot  I can see why this book us an all time classic  It has been a while since I have read this book

once I started seeing all my errors and how to improve myself with random people  my sales skyrocketed  Everyone really should really read this book   This is another of my continuous reader books  This is my first time through  but I ve decided that it s going to be reviewed often until the principles it teaches are habits in my character  This has got to be one of the best leadership book ever written  I highly recommend to anyone seeking to improve their relationships in any part of their life  Very amazing personal development book  Dale Carnegie teaches you how to interview  how to

with loads of wisdom the book certainly guides you in dealing effectively with people and achieving your objectives  but with a good intention the teaching of this book is good and it certainly has been a result of life long study and experience must read this book  A classic that took me forever to finally get to  Glad I did  I love the fact that so much that Carnegie intuited was later

forget to put it into practice daily  A very pleasant and quick read  I can t believe it took me this long to pick up this book  The book is laid out in a very easy to read manner  and can easily be digested  I am adhering to the recommendation at the onset of the book  and revisit it time and again for a refresher   This book is just amazing  A MUST for every human being It is outstanding how much we do not know about how to deal with people  How to win friends and influence people  is a complete guide to human interaction  It taught me how to understand others and extract the best of each person It is not just how to make friends  it is about how to be a better human  what then leads to make friends and influence people  An excellent foundation in human relations and communications  I ve lost count of the times I ve read it  I try to read it every year  but still I learn from it    It couldn t recommend it more highly  How to Win Friends   Influence People by Dale Carnagie is one the original books on leadership  I am glad I chose to read this book  which was recommended to me by a friend  I borrowed his copy  and after I finished reading the book  I ended up buying my own copy to have  This book teaches you fundamental techniques in handling people  six ways to make people like you  how to win people to your way of thinking  and how to be a leader  A lot of the ideas

contributed a lot to us    there has never been a similar book ever published     This is a fantastic book for a person who finds themselves in a leadership position but feels ill equipped and undertrained in it  The book is broken up into small segments so you can read it at your own pace and put the suggestions into practice immediately  You will want to keep this book close after completing as a resource of basic  how to s  in everyday leadership situations   Simply timeless  We all know these rules yet fail to apply them  This book is filled with stories to give you context of how different responses give different outcomes  Keeping these stories in mind will help you become aware of how you are responding to situations or events around you  You will learn to pause  reflect and create a better solution  Absolutely smashing read on human relations  I cannot think of a single person who wouldn t benefit from this timeless classic  A lot of the time tested advice offered in the book is not  new  per say  but it is rather compelling and the bevy of real life examples make it easy to apply the principles  Strongly recommend it   One of the best self help books you can ever read  Consists of timeless wisdom   tips that will stay with you forever and make you a better person  This book helped me tremendously both in my professional and personal lives  First let me say that this book and the wisdom and insight it provides will never outlive it s usefulness  The book its self is a good reminder of respecting your fellow man  and that just because you re right or disagree  doesn t mean you should stand and demand recognition and belittle someone just because you can  The art of influence needs to be re cultivated in our current society where people believe it s okay to beat someone down with their own opinion just because it is different than their own  Beating someone down and forcing them to agree is not influencing them  it is bullying them  This is not a good way to live  not a good way to do things and whether in business or in personal life  the toll on the relationship will eventually become evident  Dale Carnegie was a master at getting people to step back  be humble and patient enough to listen  to find out what the other persons needs or concerns were  learning how to address them and put the other person at ease and THEN moving forward  It is a lesson that needs to be carried forward and reinforced  I have this book in book form and on Audible  I listen to it once in awhile as a refresher and reminder  If you have not read or listened to this book  it is well worth the effort  This is not time that will be wasted   very good book if you are having problems getting along with people A guide for life  A reread at intervals until I have ingrained these ideas is in order  Read this long time ago in Vnese version  I was really interested in the book and it gave me quite good thoughts for my life  I thought it was written by some vnese guy at the time  Then when got back to the interest of reading self helped books few months ago  Found this version in english and read it till the end  Though I have read this book before  but it s still give strong impact as a reminder for what I choose to live Great book from my view  Great info  I think I will read it every 5 years  Everyone should   I read this once a year  This book has taught me how to work with people  who make every decision that affects you  This should be taught in school as its lessons have led to much success in life  business and relationships  not a single book can be written on personality development wdout this one the tragic of this book is that it is written by one of d greatest failures of his life   who had never succeeded in his life   THIS IS A GREAT BOOK FOR ME      This book was a great read for someone as introverted as I am  It gave me a better understanding of social interactions and motives  Would recommend to anyone struggling to understand the way people think  I was pleasantly surprised by this book  Originally I judged these principles to be manipulative  But as I listened to the book I came to realize that many of the shortcomings in business and friend relationships are due to the exploitation of others toward self interest  I didn t find these principles to be manipulative at all  In fact I found this to be a great tool box  This book helps me have the tools to express consideration and compassion towards others  this is a skill I seriously lack although I feel it inside I m unable to express it adequately  This book can make you a better person if taken seriously  The title of this book is decieving  How to Win Friends and Influence People  Generally  we don t win friends  We earn them over time through our actions  Conversely  we all need to be able to influence people in positive ways  Each section introduces a principle  for example   The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it   Then  it expounds upon the principle with recountings of situations in which the principle applies  The book provides examples of people who taught these very principles  In one section  Carnegie sites Jesus when he said   Agree quickly with your adversary   This book is about successfully managing our human relationships  It collects a lot of ideas and teaches them all at once  It is a book that contains a lot of common sense  yet  we all struggle with our personal and professional relationships If you dedicate your yourself to practicing one principle a week  you will be a better person every week of the year  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED Simply the best book out in the market for improving your interpersonal skills  First published in the 1930 s  this book is continuing being recommended   preferred even after 70  years thus reflecting its excellence  The best part is that unlike other management or self grooming improvement books  the author s language here is so much casual  ascertaining with examples where ever possible that it gradually becomes a fun to read   making it easier to comprehend the real essence Surely a must read at least once  I would  strongly  recommend it  E l unica guida che insegna a saper parlare instaurando ottime relazioni interpersonali  La retorica e un arte affascinante  E  il primo libro che leggo dove ci sono le  istruzioni per l uso   Non saprei dire se il suo metodo funzioni  certo sara servito a molti  pero e molto sottile  difficile  richiede astuzia  ritmo  saper aspettare i tempi  ed esercizio  Ho preso tantissimi appunti  Dai consigli che elargisce  l uomo sembra essere un essere spregevole  concentrato solo su di se   principio 3  ricordatevi che per una persona il suo nome e il suono piu dolce e piu importante in qualsiasi lingua  Ma si puo essere cosi egocentrici  Si  si puo  Anch io la penso come Dale Molte sue lezioni gia le conoscevo  come i primi capitoli del libro  pero leggendolo ho potuto approfondire con nuovi concetti e soprattutto conoscere meglio personaggi come Lincoln  Al Capone  Rockfeller  Crowley  2 guns   T  Roosevelt  Questo libro e come un manuale per risolvere i problemi di tutti i giorni  Permette di trasformare qualunque lettore e di prestare piu attenzione al proprio comportamento  E  interessante coinvolgente   basta relazionare gli errori commessi alle pagine lette  This book is amazing  Don t be fooled that it was originally written in the 1930s  the principles in it are still true today   we humans don t change THAT much  LOVED IT  Already lots   lots of reviews followed by praise have been showering to Dale Carnegie and I am very proud to say that I am among those many  Its in the best interest of everyone that I reveal nearly nothing about this book because it is highly recommended by me that you go thro  this personal experience of reading this book all by yourself     So buy this NOW   Change your life                   Carnegie  changed my life    Warren Buffett              Need I say anything      Timeless advice  teaches you how to deal with other people   Everyone should read it twice  This book is on the top of my list  A life changing book that everyone should read   I m not teaching a bag of tricks  End of the day  none of this would work if there are no sincerity and empathy  The honesty put down by Dale Carnegie got me hooked in this book till the finishing  I strongly recommend this book for everyone  I am wanting to work from home selling handmade crafts  but I still felt like I need to learn my business and for that reason  I have tried to find a few books that might help me  And I feel like this one not only helped me learn some good business etiquette but also how to  hopefully  be a better person  There are no earth shattering secrets listed yet the techniques are simple things that many people overlook in their daily lives and could benefit from applying them and opening up many more doors  This is definitely one of those books that would benefit from multiple readings as there are many areas that are touched on and can be applied as needed   A must read for anyone  This book is packed with simple  day to day principles that serve to help people get along  simply put  It is probably one of the first books anyone should read  This book is a manuel to effectively win people over  Definitely something I ll reread through my lifetime  Biggest highlight for me was learning techniques on how to remember names  I was terrible and decided to change it  thanks to that chapter   Recommended to everyone  I wanted to read this book over again and again  Dale Carnegie shows you how simple it can be to have empathy  but how powerful it is as a way of better communicating with people and achieving positive outcomes for both sides  This should be a must read at schools   I ve not written a book of tricks but a new way of life   Dale CarnegieOne might think from the title of this book that Dale Carnegie has written a  how to  book on manipulation  Nothing could be further from the truth  To quote an Eastern proverb   If you wish to change the world  you must first change yourself   In  How to Win Friends and Influence People   Carnegie presents techniques on how to act like a decent individual  He contends that if you act like a decent person to other people  then you will in turn be treated much better by other people  Reading this book will reveal how often we all fail at acting decently and gently  If you want to live a better life  then read this book and put its lessons into practice  Although I can t claim to practice this book perfectly  what I have put into practice certainly have helped me  This book is must read for anyone in business   More important to humankind than the bible  Fantastic read  I loved this  Such great tips for interacting with your friends  co workers  and strangers   One of my Dad s books  I read it many  many years

examples from great leaders  thinkers and also persons like you and I  The author has this ability to get close to his reader and accompanying him in his quest to self realization  At first glance this may look like a how to be manipulative manual but it s not  It s a how to be that person you always wanted to be  The person who enjoys socializing  who isn t afraid of people and who is at home in any situation  Genuine people do these things   sometimes unknowingly  Sure  some people may abuse them  but if you re really doing it the right way then the focus becomes all about the other

an excellent read  Very informative and entertaining  I recommend it to everyone who wants to know more about handling people  I wish this book was named something else   like  How to treat people respectfully  or something else that doesn t make you feel like you need friends or actually want to influence people  It s just a really good handbook about how to be a nice person  I have read this book at least once every year since the late 80 s  It s been in print for 77 years and the info is just as  if not more  valuable as the day it was written  The better we get in working well with one another  the better the world will be   This book was originally written in the 1930s  but it is still relevant today  The author explains how to use psychology and good manners to get people to do what you want  The principles in this book can apply to your personal as well as professional life  The underlying message is essentially the Golden Rule  Treat others as you would want to be treated

apologize for my learning curve     This book is amazing  Mr Carnegie lays out clearly and concisely some steps you can take to become a more likable  friendly person and a more effective leader of those around you  I will admit that I was a little hesitant to read it at first  foolishly think  I don t need to be taught how to make friends   but I had no idea what I was missing  This book is wonderful and will be re read many  many times from now on  If you haven t read it yet  go buy it and read it today  If you have read it  go pick it up again and re read it today  You won t be

written today  Groundbreaking for it s time  I first read it decades ago  Worth re reading  This book is one of the best I have ever read  A true classis and a must for anyone that deals with people or wants to improve their people relationship skills  Should be required reading and used as a learning text for everyone  starting in childhood  Not everyone learns the  rules  of getting along in

kazdy glupiec   i wiekszosc glupcow to robi  Ale aby zrozumiec i darowac  potrzeba charakteru i samokontroli    Wielki czlowiek pokazuje swoja wielkosc przez sposob  w jaki traktuje maluczkich    powiedzial Carlyle   Uwazam  ze najcenniejsza rzecza  jaka posiadam  jest umiejetnosc rozbudzania w ludziach entuzjazmu   powiedzial Schwab   a jedyny sposob  w jaki mozna naklonic czlowieka do ujawnienia tego  co w nim najlepsze  to uznanie i zacheta  Nic tak nie niszczy ambicji w ludziach jak krytyka zwierzchnikow  Nigdy nie krytykuje nikogo  Wierze w dawanie ludziom bodzcow do pracy Kilka lat temu przeprowadzono wywiady z zonami  ktore opuscily mezow  Jak sadzisz  co bylo glowna przyczyna ich odejscia  Brak uznania  I zalozylbym sie  ze podobne badania wsrod mezczyzn  ktorzy odeszli od zon  przynioslyby te same wyniki  Czesto jestesmy tak pewni lojalnosci swoich wspolmalzonkow  ze nie przychodzi nam do glowy powiedziec im  jak bardzo ich cenimy To bardzo dobra rada i chce ja powtorzyc  jesli jest w ogole jakis sekret sukcesu  lezy on w umiejetnosci przyjecia punktu widzenia innych i patrzeniu na rzeczy zarowno z pozycji rozmowcy  jak i wlasnej Tysiace zmeczonych  zle zarabiajacych i zniecheconych akwizytorow zdziera dzis zelowki na ulicach naszych miast  Dlaczego  Poniewaz zawsze mysla tylko o tym  do czego sami daza  Nie zdaja sobie sprawy z faktu  ze ani ty  ani ja nie chcemy niczego kupowac Gdybysmy chcieli  po prostu poszlibysmy do sklepu  Jednak i ty  i ja jestesmy zawsze zainteresowani rozwiazaniem naszych problemow  I jesli akwizytorzy wykaza  ze ich towary lub uslugi pomoga nam je rozwiazac  nie beda musieli nas namawiac do kupna  Sami kupimy  A klienci lubia czuc  ze sami kupuja jakis towar  a nie ze towar jest im sprzedawany Nawet chorobliwi pieniacze czesto miekna i daja sie uspokoic  gdy maja przed soba cierpliwego i wspolczujacego sluchacza  ktory nie protestuje  kiedy wladczym glosem wyrazaja oburzenie i wypluwaja z siebie jad   Sa tak przejeci tym  co maja za chwile powiedziec sami  ze nie trzymaja uszu   otwartych      Wiele waznych osobistosci mowilo mi  ze wola dobrych sluchaczy od dobrych mowcow  ale umiejetnosc sluchanie wydaje sie rzadsza od wszystkich innych  Male zdanka  takie jak   przepraszam  ze sprawiam klopot     czy zechcialby pan        czy moge prosic        czy mialby pan cos przeciw   i wreszcie   dziekuje   a wiec te drobne uprzejmosci naoliwiaja tryby monotonnej maszyny codziennego zycia  I przy okazji stanowia znak rozpoznawczy dobrze wychowanych W dziewieciu przypadkach na dziesiec spor konczy sie tym  ze kazda ze stron przekonana jest bardziej niz kiedykolwiek o wlasnej racji Klotnia jest zawsze twoja przegrana  Dlaczego  Poniewaz jesli przegrasz  to przegrales  a jesli wygrasz  to i tak przegrales  Przypuscmy  ze zatriumfujesz nad innym czlowiekiem  obracajac w gruzy wszystkie jego argumenty  Udowodnisz mu  ze jest non compos mentis  I co wtedy  Tu poczujesz sie swietnie  A twoj rozmowca  Pokazesz mu jego nizszosc  zranisz jego dume i spowodujesz  ze obrazi sie za twoje zwyciestwoPohamuj swoj temperament  Pamietaj  ze klase czlowieka mozna mierzyc tym  co wyprowadza go z rownowagi  Najpierw sluchaj  Daj oponentowi szanse wygadania sie  Pozwol mu skonczyc  Nie przerywaj i nie protestuj  To tylko wznosi bariery  Probuj budowac mosty porozumienia  Nie stawiaj kolejnych przeszkod na drodze do niego Obiecaj oponentowi  ze przemyslisz jego poglad i dokladnie go przeanalizujesz  I faktycznie to zrob  Twoj rozmowca moze przeciez miec racje  Jest o wiele latwiej zgodzic sie na ponowne przemyslenie argumentow rozmowcy niz gwaltownie przec do przodu i doprowadzic do sytuacji  w ktorej bedziesz musial uslyszec    Probowalem przeciez ci to powiedziec  ale nie sluchales  Czasem zmieniamy zdanie sami z siebie bez zadnego nacisku  Jednak jesli ktos mowi nam  ze nie mamy racji  powoduje  ze nasze serca staja sie twarde  Jestesmy nieprawdopodobnie wrecz niedbali w ksztaltowaniu naszych przekonan  ale w momencie  kiedy ktokolwiek chce nam je zabrac  natychmiast wypelnia nas niezlomna wiara w ich slusznosc  Oczywiscie  to nie przekonania sa nam tak drogie  lecz nasza duma wlasna  ktora jest przez to zagrozona    Maly zaimek   moj  jest slowem najwazniejszym dla kazdego czlowieka i wlasciwe zrozumienie tego faktu stanowi klucz do madrosci  Ma te sama sile bez wzgledu na to  czy jest to   moj  obiad    moj  pies    moj  dom    moj  ojciec    moj  kraj czy   moj  Bog  Odrzucamy z uraza nie tylko zarzuty  ze nasz zegarek zle chodzi albo nasz samochod jest kiepski  ale rowniez mozliwosc  ze nasze wyobrazenia o kanalach na Marsie  sposobie wymowy slowa Epiktet  wartosci medycznej salicyny czy panowaniu Sargona Pierwszego moga zostac podwazone  Lubimy wierzyc we wszystko to  co przyjelismy raz za prawde  i podwazenie ktoregokolwiek z naszych przekonan powoduje  ze za wszelka cene szukac bedziemy wytlumaczenia  dlaczego je zywimy  Wasnie dlatego

nami delikatnie i taktownie  przyznamy sie do tego przed innymi  a nawet bedziemy dumni z naszej szczerosci i otwartosci  Ale nie wtedy  gdy ktos probuje wepchnac nam nasze niestrawne slowa z powrotem

 Tremendous insights that you will hear in different forms from different people today  Pay attention and apply what you read and see what a difference it will make in your life  A must read and re read for anyone who lives  works  plays with people  Worth reading over and over again  New learning every time   This book is worth reading Here some quotations from it   Don t complain about the snow on your neighbor s roof  when your own doorstep is unclean  A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men  Don t be afraid of enemies who attack you Be afraid of the friends who flatter you  Every man I meet is my superior in some way In that  I learn of him   People who can put themselves in the place of other people  who can understand the workings of their minds  need never worry about what the future has in store for them   One wears on one s face is far more important than the clothes one wears on one s back  Actions speak louder than words  As much as we thirst for approval we dread condemnation  Dale Carnegie s best  No one does a better job of teaching you how to put others  interest and needs before your own  Best book I ever read  If you are in the capacity of managing people or you would like to drastically improve the way you communicate and work with people  then this is your bible  It is one of those books that qualify to be on the short list of  life changing  Great little bits of information for you scattered through out this book  Not just on  how to win friends  but on history and how people think as a whole   A lot of people have talked about it  thought u might just read it my self  I think it s better what they all said about it  It s more about self improvements  Read this book back in mid 1980 s and loved it  Would rank it as one of the top 10 books a person should have in their library   This one might seem like a no brainer  due to its status as a classic  Aptly named  this book discusses how to  express ideas  to assume leadership  and to arouse enthusiasm among people   Carnegie teach us not to win friends but to be a good sincere person and friends will be win without we realize it  Old but still actual principle on how to handle relation with people  When I first heard the title of Carnegie s description of successful human relations  I must admit that it sounded almost as if it had a malevolent tone to it  That notion soon left me when I read the summaries of the chapters and eventually the whole book  I grew up with some understanding of most of the ideas that are promulgated by Carnegie  but had never organized them into quite the cohesive unit of philosophy and behavior that his book details  I highly recommend this book to anyone who deals with people and would like to improve their positive interactions with those around them  Chac vai tro cua cuon  Dac nhan tam  voi the loai sach ki nang cung gan giong khai quoc cong than nhi Biet ro sach ki nang bay gio rat da dang  khong con

sales should read this book   oldie but goodie Although this is a book I couldn t avoid knowing about  I did avoid reading it for many years as I have a deep seated cynicism regarding self help books  In this case  that cynicism was misplaced The book offers straightforward  practical advice and examples on understanding and dealing with people  It s mostly common sense once you think about it  but I realised there were a few things I wasn t doing well  I m now working on changing those  The most significant for me was remembering to think about what the other person in any given situation wants  I think that this will help me improve outcomes in many situations  even though it s by no means a panacea  Awesome book   must read      One main point in book People will think better of you if you talk to them or listen to them about things they are interested in rather then if you talk about how great you are or about things you are specifically interested in  In general people are interested in themselves  He tells a story in the book about one individual who listened to another person for an entire conversation and did not speak much at all  After the had the conversation the talker commented on the listener being a great conversationalist  The talker enjoyed the conversation because it was about them and felt that the listener was enjoyable to talk to because of this    How this relates to view of the worldAsk people about themselves  I can learn about others point of views this way and have then leaving the conversation with a warm feeling  I have a tendency to point out the other side of an argument   nicked name devils advocate by friends  and this can be less usefull if the goal is to win friends  The idea of listening to other people and making them feel important is a skill that is worth developing to both being a good friend and learning how to influence people   ideally in a positive way   Over all i enjoyed the audio book and have listened to it a couple of times  once in 2004 and once in 2007  Probably a book worth re reading every few years   Very well written  Great examples are given thru out the book to give you an idea of how to use the tips  Overall this is book for those who want to be better at influencing others as well as speaking   Must read to anyone    I have read to three times to absorb its lessons and it may take me my whole life to practice those  Awesome  A must read for everyone   One of the best books I ve ever learned from on human interaction    1983   This was the very first  business book  I read  I was working for a corporation that offered Dale Carnegie courses at no charge to its employees  what a blessing    Little did I know  this book would later sit prominently on the bookshelf of my own company when the one I worked for changed hands  It changed my life for the better  This a typical  how to  book but filled with an array of stories that anyone from a CEO to a middle manager can relate to  There are fascinating stories of people like Lincoln  Schwab  and Truman  among others  who have used the techniques to their advantage  A parent  president  or aspiring business student can all get the most out of this book   Everyone should read this book  It offers great tips and examples of how to be a better person  If only I could implement them all immediately  I should probably read this book over and over again   Sounded Cheesy  but was recommended by literally every successful person s reading list I ve ever seen  Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger especially tout this book as a way to be effective even when dealing with assholes  Ini buku bagus  Wajib dibaca bagi orang orang yang terpaksa harus berada di lingkungan yang kurang menyenangkan  Buku ini memberi petunjuk bagaimana kita bersikap dan menanggapi orang lain    How to win friends and influence people teaches you basically how to be a good person  It highlights three main points when dealing with people 1  Don t criticize  condemn  or complain  2  Give honest and sincere appreciation  3  Arouse in the other person an eager want  This book doesn t have characters or a setting  This book give real life examples of why people act the way they act and how do deal with them  It also teaches you how to make people think the way you do  how to be a leader  and change people for the good I picked this book because it was recommended to me by two different people  They said this book completely changed the way they though of things  One is a very successful business man and the other is a missionary  The way they think just blows my mind and makes complete sense  I read this book because I want to be like them  I think the book worked very well the way he explained things and gave real life examples  I like how he breaks things down into simpler parts  I like that in the beginning of the book he says to mark things so when you reread it you remember what stood out to you  I like that he gives you ideas and challenges  Most of all I like the way he thinks and what this book is really about  There was only a few things I didn t like about the book  First  at times it got a little to advanced for me and I didn t know what some of the words were  Second  some of the examples he gave were too old for me to really know about and they didn t help me understand what he was trying to say  My overall impression is that this book is amazing  I know I will continue to reread it throughout my life  It really does teach you how to be the kind of person you want to be  I think everyone should read this book  Although I don t think everyone should read it young  it s more something adults and mature younger people should read  This books is especially good for people who want to be successful in life not only in their job  but just dealing with everyday people  This book doesn t have any content that needs warning   Questionable title but very good book  A must read for EVERYONE living on planet earth who deals with human beings  Very useful  easy to read information I wish I had read it before ever getting married  I m already reading it through again with a pencil this time to underline passages  I am truly going to attempt to implement the principles in each chapter   If I had no limits  I would give this books to every young person in hear shot  Kak perestat  bespokoit sia i nachat

Nice book  Recommended for every one who wants to be a better person and understand people behaviour   I really liked this book  I think that if everyone read this book  people s social relations with others would improve dramatically  There are so many great tips in this book  all stressing making the other person happy  If everyone tried to make the other person happy  imagine the great improvements people s relationships would have  However  I can see how this book would be controversial  Some people think that having principals on improving relations with others makes things not very genuine  However  Dale Carnegie stresses practicing these techniques in handling people over and over again until they become second nature  Then the habits in dealing with people you formed will come naturally  While reading this book there were so many instances where I thought  If I did this  that situation would ve been so much better   or  If more people were educated about this  the world would be so much more pleasant   Since reading this book and practicing the principals Dale talks about  I ve already noticed a dramatic improvement in my relationships with others  I think that there are many great ideas that someone could take away from this book  and I d recommend that everyone read it   Must read for anyone who wants to succeed in personal and professional life  The best book ever written on management  Great read  full of information  Learn it and use it  Great translation  really helpful everyone should read this book  This is the most important book anyone will ever read  and constantly refer back to   It was a great insight to how relationships work  It also gave me a better understanding of how to be more persuasive and still maintaining all core values  It is a must read for anyone in business or that deals with people on a regular basis The Book  How To Win Friends And Influence People  By Dale Carnegie is a great informative read about learning how to deal with people and how to win people to your way of thinking  The author Dale Carnegie  rip  was an excellent author who not only just provided you with information on how to deal with people in certain situations  also gave excellent examples on how to do so  I find that every day I act and think differently based on reading this book This book is divided into several parts all about how to deal with people  rather than influencing them to think like you  you change their mind by getting them to want to do it  There are 4 parts to this book  each with a large group of sub chapters that sometimes overlap each other  but all together teach a different lesson the book starts with Part One  Fundamental Techniques in handling people  which is really just an overview of basic lessons and quotes to think about before you actually start the actual learning  Then the book really picks up when you enter part two  6 ways to make people like you  This chapter is a good part about making friends  making people like you and leaving a good lasting impression  Then we go over to part Three  How to win people to your way of thinking  It is here where we learn more of the persuasion of the book where it shows how people think and how when they have made up their mind you really can t change it by force  Part Three  shows how to change people s thinking the right way without making them mad  This chapter is personally my favorite part of the book  Part Four   Be a leader  How to change people without giving offense or arousing resentment  This part was part about leading people and how to get people to like you and follow your command without being a jerk about it  This part really capitalises on the idea that everyone makes fault and no one likes to look at there own  but point out others this part helps you understand how beneficial it is to criticize yourself Overall this is a great book and will probably be one of my all time favorites  It is a great read and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get ahead in their own lives and careers  Great book on interpersonal communication skills  I refer to chapters of this book often  Loved it   In a documentary I watched on Warren Buffett  it said that when he was young he was not good at public speaking  He took a Dale Carnegie course and he says it influenced him a lot I decided to read the book and see how this book can affect me  The advice in this book applies to everybody  and the advice is timeless because in every era you need to learn how to interact and deal with people   One of my favorite quotes in this book is   Personally I am very fond of strawberries and cream  but I have found that for some strange reason  fish prefer worms  So when I went fishing  I did not think about what I wanted  I thought about what they wanted  I didn t bait the hook with strawberries and cream  Rather  I dangled a worm or grasshopper in front of the fish and said   Wouldn t you like to have that  Why not use the same common sense when fishing for people   Carnegie 145   This quote made a lot of sense to me and when you read the quote the first time it just makes an impression on you   You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you  Carnegie 120  These quotes probably takes a lot of experience to make and some people still ignores it and think what they do is right   This book taught me a lot on psychology as well as interacting with people  This book can probably change many people s lives because the wisdom in this book can change your decisions and how you act   Amazing book  I hate reading books but when I started with this one it totally changed me  I was to read more and learn more about handling people Thanks One of the best book I ve read in my life I liked this a lot more than I thought I would  I thought it would be a tedious review of things I already knew  It was a review of things I knew  but it was a great review that wasn t tedious  Some things were particularly helpful to be reminded of as a parent  I didn t view the advice as tricking people into following you but rather working on one s empathy to understand others and move forward together  Very direct book with principles and steps to understand and influence people  step by step    went through this course  I ll do what the author prescribed in preface  read again the points mentioned and put inside your head and stop violating from the principle  we need to follow up the things mentioned in the book  which is actually pretty straightforward with real life examples  doable and necessary for improving your relationship with people  i have my notes listing the principles for daily look through  it is not a book for the week or day  it is for your life so read the principle again and again to have a successful result  In today s world where human skills is the most important thing  we don t give much attention to it and do some stupid mistakes in daily life  This book will make you realize about some of mistakes that we do repeatedly and don t know the impact of it on our relationship with others  Author has tried to convince reader with examples takes from his students and great people from history  I loved some of points like1   With argument you might win  but you will loose a friend 2   Finding mistakes in others won t bring anything but appreciating them on small things and talking about your mistakes can bring lot of improvements 3   What you want no one cares so match your want with their want and you won t need to do anything else to get things done 4   My favourite  If you want enemies  excel your friends  but if you want friends  let your friends excel you 5   Dont give orders  ask them questions 6   Show  genuine  interest in others and they will always take care of you 7   Don t criticize  condemn or complain  Also never say  you are wrong and let the other person save face 8   Always begin with praise and honest appreciation  The title makes it seem much more nefarious than it actually is  which is a shame  I hope it doesn t turn people off  I found it to be a wonderful examination of how to have mutually enriching relationships with others  I have read this book twice before  but decided to read it again since a friend is reading it and I wanted to compare notes Carnegie says criticising people will never work as people will always justify their behaviour  It is much better to reward good behaviour and to understand the other person      Finished reading it  The beauty of reading on the Kindle is that I highlighted the key points and will make a summary  reference document  I may publish this on my blog This book is certainly a classic on interpersonal communication and leadership  Very good book  Everyone should read  Goodbye  social ineptitude  This book is ever relevant  I intend to read it till I perfect it and I know I can never perfect it  So I am gonna read it for ever   till my eye sight doesn t fade away  Though most of the examples quoted are centuries old it strikes chord with your so called contemporary times instantly  I wish I could thank Dale Carnegie in person  The world would be a better place to live in if everyone reads this book  Be sure to read the non revised edition  The revised edition is missing a whole section on marriage  I was recommended this book about 20 years ago and have read it a few times since then and highly recommend it to anyone  To some  the title might suggest that this is a book on how to manipulate people to your way of thinking  but it is the opposite  It is a book on being a genuine  likable person by forgetting about your own selfish desires and becoming genuinely interested in others and their point of view  and showing it through how you act toward them  The book is broken down into a set of basic  skills  he describes through anecdotes from his own experience  The stories make the book interesting and entertaining to read  and help illustrate his concepts  A must read for everyone in my opinion  One of THE classics in human communication and self help books  A true classic  I first read this a long time ago and I need to re read  Particularly the bit about criticising  don t do it  one s nearest and dearest In a nutshell  the fundamental way to get someone to do what you want is to make them want to do it because they want to   There s a lot more on human psychology so go read it  It s an easy read There is only caveat I would add  Not everyone will respond to the Carnegie method  Sometimes one has to guard against psychopaths and other malevolents that one comes across  All the  seeing things through their eyes  in the world will not help     Principles of dealing with people that are simple but often overlooked  Very dissimilar to many modern  aggressive  individualistic methods of success  The principles all develop from a sincere appreciation for others  such basic principles that really  any human should follow  but somehow we all forget  fantastic read and def a must have for any in home library   A book that reaffirmed and quantified lot of things I have thought for a long time  Like the morning sun revealing a grain elevator you suspected was hidden in the morning fog the entire time  Great book   bagus  buat melatih emosi dan bergaul yg efektif  Ini jg salah satu buku yg banyak berpengaruh dalam hidupku One of the first self help books I read  Easy to read and understand and quite a few light bulb moments for me  A terrific book on how to be successful in both your personal and professional life  I personally think it s one of the best books I have ever read in my life  Dale Carnegie wrote it in 1936 and it s still one of the best sellers of all times It took the writer 15 years to actually write it because he did a very thorough research in the lives of many great leaders  philosophers and men of letters that had lived before him  ex  Jesus  Buddha  Julius Caesar  Shakespeare  Napoleon Lincoln  Mark Twain  Edison  etc   The book is more like a collection of wonderful stories of how these remarkable men and many others reacted in different situations  The book teaches you how to cherish LIFE and how to nurture feelings of love and friendship towards others  Above all  it teaches you how to develop your emotional intelligence and senses of empathy  I can honestly say this book has changed my life  as I now have a better understanding of human nature  I think if at least half of the people of this planet read this book  the world would definitely be a better place     Had to read it for myself to see why a 1930s book is still so popular today  must read book  A great way for the socially inept to understand other people and get a long  Was initially turned off by the title  but after hearing about the book and the author a lot i decided to give it a try  Was definitely not disappointed and it truly is practical advice   Wow  I hope this book changes my life  I feel like I should read it all again because i would be ashamed if I can t apply what Dale Carnegie is teaching  This book explains all the adroit mannerisms of social interaction in a simple way  It s full of numerous examples that highlight his suggestions to succeed in compromise  win friends  and influence people  I can not say enough about how excited I am with this book   Title makes it sound lame  but it s influenced me deeply over the years   Great and easy to read  Another book that everyone should read  Aguu karnegiin aguu nom   A timeless classic that will always resonate A great referance book  Brilliant Great book on practical tips of how to succeed in any scenario  I try to re read at least once a year  This book is amazing  It is now on my  Books everyone should read  list  Good common sense and practical guide to how to treat people  A genuinely fascinating insight into the social dynamics and psychology of winning people over to your way of thinking   would of loved to have met Carnegie  AWESOME  Changed the way I view all of my relationships   Very  very  VERY good   Definitely recommend this to any girl  whether they re a tween  teen  mid teen  or late teen   If everyone reads this book the world would be a much better place to live in  Every one who wants to handle people better should read this one  For managers is a must reading   This is an excellent book that should be read by everyone  This will definitely put you on the right track with dealing with people  I think if everyone read and put this book into practice  we would probably have a world with less conflict and more personal growth   For all of those reviews that bash this book  I must ask myself  did they even read it  There are so many people who say that the book turns you into a  people pleaser  or a manipulator who  uses  your relationships  None of this is the case  Carnegie states  VERY frequently  that if you are not earnest  honest  and sincere in your attempts to win friends and influence people you will totally and utterly fail  Now off my soapbox and onward towards the positive  what I would like to highlight is that even after all the years since the book was originally written all of the same principles seem to ring true  I have been applying them as I have been learning them and  let me tell you  ALL of them WORK  I have used each and every principle to either smooth over a situation  get a person to come over to my way of thinking  or bring new and exciting people into my life as friends  I would suggest that everyone  especially those who have bashed it  read  or reread  this book and implement the rules and principles covered  Those who do will  most likely  lead happier  more harmonious  and more productive lives  Long standing advice on communicating effectively with strangers and colleagues   ktb ry   wjmyl wsqr h mr   khr  fy lqryb l jl n sh llh Awesome book  one of the must to read   Really helped me understand what I am already doing to be a good friend and where I can improve in my relationships   fy lktb hdh Trq mfyd  wjyd shy nt lmh mn Gyrntnf n wtfn  GyrntHsy lktb ytklm  n nZr  m yn  bSrH  ktb jyd nSHkm byh The techniques in this book are immortal  Dale Carnegie s book is very compelling 70 years later  The most important aspect of the book is that first and foremost  it is a book about sincerity and deep human values  Winning friends and influencing people comes first from genuine respect and caring for others  The book s techniques provide additional guidance in identifying blind spots in one s behavior that turn off people and create unnecessary friction   Lots of very valuable information in this book  It all seems like common sense  yet not many people actually use these skills  It will take some time to implement them into my habits though   Love the analogies and stories  Make perfect sense  Some were just repeating though or rather similar I love the Lincoln references  I read this book years ago and remember how impactful it was on my life  What I remember most is the encouragement to take the first step in any relationship   to smile and say hello to the person who never says hello and always seems grouchy i e  the person who you ve been totally turned off of  What happened by taking the inititave just to smile and say hi  was amazing  Invariably  there was a return smile and instant connection  The next time  that same  so called silent  grouchy person was smiling and saying hello first to me If Dale Carnegie s advice seems simple  it is because it is  But his simple advice is also very wise  His message is basically treat others as you would like to be treated  don t judge anyone until you have a walked a mile in their moccasins and each of us has much more in common with every person than we can possibly imagine This book is very positive and wonderful guide for living a kind and fulfilling life  It is well worth reading again and again because its message is universal and will never be out of date  very helpful and my son loves it This book was surprisingly good  I assumed that it would be a bit hokey  what with the business world obsessing over it  However  underlying the whole book is a message that not only makes you successful with people  but also just makes you a better person in general  I d definitely recommend reading it and trying to incorporate some of its ideas in the ways that you interact with others  The granddaddy of self help books   GREAT BOOK  WITH GREAT ADVICE  With this book  Carnegie created the relationship Bible  The advice he shared is just as relevant today as it was when the book was first printed  This is  in large part  due to the fact that Carnegie s understanding of the timeless aspects of human nature is so complete  This is a book that should be on everyone s bookshelf  I am going to keep it in my personal library forever   Despite the book s name  that sounds really scheming  I wish more people would read this book  it has a lot of good advice on how to be a decent human being  friend and even life partner   Read dozens of times Time to reread  Truly a classic  Turned me from a shy boy into a confident salesman  Excellent book  a must read for anyone that wants to improve their lives Don t be put off by the title  it isn t a manual for manipulation  totally ethical techniques that not only can help you  but can help others at the same time  i have heard many comment about this book  suggestion and criticisms alike but for me personally  i love it dale carnegie tells basic principle of human relation that is so commonsense   i don t know why wouldn t i use it earlier it acts more as a remainder then a lecturer he also strengthen those principle with a true story that act as an evidence to proof that those principle is do work on business  as well as on family i would recommend this book to my family and friends it might not make them be a great public speaker but at least it encourage them to be a nice person that we all love  One of the best books I ve ever read  Much of this book is common sense  but Carnegie presents everything in very clear and engaging anecdotes  This book isn t really a book about how to be successful in business  but rather a guidebook on how to be successful in life  Carnegie puts a huge emphasis on being a good person  This is a truly inspiring book that changed the way I see people and the world  I have to admit that this book is amazing  It has completely changed my life in many aspects  Thank you Mr  Carnegie for publishing this book and changed millions of people s lives  Visit my blog for stories on how this book changed my life  http   yoursandmystory blogspot ca  Great ways to communicate and improve your life  by learning to listen  and then express yourself more

Two thumbs up  This book is timeless and a must read  There is a reason why it remains popular since 1936   Best book to start to Handle complaints  avoid arguments and keep our relations smooth and pleasant  i want to read this  Currently re reading this classic on human relations and communication  I m enjoying it even more this time than my first run through it  This is the kind of book that should be re read every few years  I m amazed at how much I d forgotten and how accurate and useful Carnegie s observations are  Awesome books  Principles are still relevant today  There s a reason why this is a classic   must read in personal development world  It works   Everybody should read this book An old classic but still so true Great book  A must read for everyone who wants to improve his social skills  It s a useful book it made me change many ideas and improve my skills as well  In my opinion this book must be read for everyone working in Buisness the book was very diversfied from stories to conclusions  I really liked this book and it s one of the most smart books i ve ever read in self developpement  I advice it to anyone who wants to be an efficient person and a true leader  I wasn t bored in any page from the book because every page  every single word was studied and well adapted the traduction was very good  I think this book changed my life   In the beginning I underestimated the principles of this book  I considered them to be just a cheat sheet on how to become more  like able   Well  basically it is that  but the author has put a great effort in convincing the reader about why these principles work  In the end I was thoroughly expressed from the examples the author users  and his style of writing  I now consider it to be a classic book in its field  well worth reading   Great book for all managers and sales people   There are a lot of intricacies behind the pithy aphorisms that are frequently repeated in this book  The scenarios and examples offer eye opening windows to not just how to apply Carnegie s tips  but how human nature works at the ground level  Knowing what is core to human relationships is not only important in vocational success but in personal pursuits as well  Becoming someone who is genuine   that s the meaning of this book  and in a world where everything is becoming less and less  it s an important one If more poeple would communicate using these principles our live would be a lot better  I have been meaning to read this book for a very long time and finally just bought the audiobook on iTunes  I quite enjoyed it and I can already see how it is helping me with my work  family and church responsibilities  I think everyone should read this book at some point in their lives   It s Dale Carnegie  enough said   Fabulous book  with so many great insights to digest  Excellent for improving social skills  This is a great  logical book about dealing with people  It is not a book about being manipulative and mean to get what you want  It s about giving other people what they want and need and in return  you ll be blessed too  I like it because it s true  This is a good book to read and reread   Incidently  I ve read it several times over since I was a teenager   this book is incredible   its like a magic  first i didn t know if what people saying about it is true   Is it really able to change your attitude    how can a book do that    How could those famous people just got through these things     and now i have their experience        its also a non boring book   i read it more than one time and Now iam making notes just to remember the important advice and situations     i hope people try this book and try to do exactly what is written in it  A good book for tips and techniques in working with people  Very insightful book  now if I could only heed the advice    I took good notes which I plan on reading frequently and have this book on my  to read again  shelf for a year from now  Picked the book up for 99c   downloaded it on audio  Awesome stuff  May need another read for principles to really sink in  Potentially a life changing book but the reader must take the content seriously   be prepared to consciously put it into action  This book is perfect   especially for the socially awkward such as myself  I ve always had problems relating to people  Hopefully  by using the mentioned techniques I can build more fulfilling and meaningful relationships  It will be painful and take a lot of practice but I ll master it   I Read the translated version of the Arabic and it was very useful and fun      Lovely book  _     I plan to re read this book until the pages fall out  I think it s a must read for anyone who has to deal with people on a daily basis  which is almost everyone  While the ideas in this book aren t that far from common sense  reading it will remind you of how to be better person   The title makes this sound manipulative  On the contrary  it is just full of good principles on how you should treat people at home as well as at work  It is a great study on human nature and I will definately read it again  Super practical  A timeless classic  Carnegie is part mentor  part wise sage  and part historian  An inspiring book that should be on everyone who has to work for a living s shelf  A business classic that is always a good refresher to end one year and start the New Year   I found this helpful  I was glad to know that I already do some of the things he suggested   this is atleast the tenth time ive read this book  and its still giving me new knowledge  A very good book   The stories are very rich and entertaining   It Deserves to be read and reread    Especially the part about building leadership    I think we should be given this book in high schools to read    It changed the way I thought about people  completely  A life changer for certain  My second read through of this timeless classic  Handling people is certainly an art  and is something that not nearly enough people  myself included  are adept at  Implementing just a few of these principles have helped my relationships dramatically  I will definitely be reading through it many more times in the coming years The only downside to reading this is that to people not familiar with the book  you look like a psycho   Great book  This book is ESSENTIAL  If I were to memorize by heart a book  this would be one of them  I ve read this numerous times and I always learn something new  Thank you Dale Carnegie   This is one of those few books in a lifetime that actually provide practical advice that isn t complete bullshit  If you don t read anything else in life  This should be in the top 10 of them   Un zambet transmite mult mai mult decat o incruntare  This should be a must read to graduate from Elementary School and then Junior High School and finally High School  It should then be re read every 5 or 10 years      qrw h llmr  lthny khms njwm msh ktyr   lyh wHd mn   Zm lktb lty qr th wGyrt Hyty jdhryan This is a classic that I really do plan on re reading  I thought I did well in communicating with people but this book is really genuine about how to treat people well and be sincere Its written with great examples on how to use the tips in the book   Just a reminder of how to live  Another must read for those who have careers that require a proper  bedside  manner  I loved this book  I am naturally very task oriented  and so this brought so much clarity to me about what people love and they way they think  I feel more equipped to please people and bring more life and vivacity into the world  I am so inspired  Carnegie s points are applicable to my actual life  Even if you are naturally people oriented  this book teaches you how to improve on those qualities  It is all around helpful  and worthy of time in your busy schedule  It truly helps you want to love people  I recommend this book with any authority I possess  Another book everybody who considers themselves human  should read  author guides us with awesome examples  little stories rather than jotting down point  like in professional books I asure u this book will mould you in to a perfect human No wonder this book still sells millions of copy around the world  If you have some problems relating to human relationship  you will find a solution in this book  Great book  A must read for anyone whose livelihood  happiness  and peace of mind depend on their interactions with people  which is really everyone  Probably the best book regarding how human psychology and sociology effect every aspect of your life  Very eye opening  Dale Carnegie has captured the essence of efficient communication and compiled it into a neat  methodical manual  Each chapter is succinct and clear  The one sentence summaries at the end of each chapter are also useful  Anyone who is placed in daily contact with people  small demographic  I know  should be reading this  The book discusses many conversational techniques that seem to be common sense but are usually overlooked  Carnegie tailors his advice to business situations but it is also good for personal relationships as well  As a college student  Business major  I understand how these communication strategies can prove useful in a corporate setting  I am glad that I encountered this book early in my life since I will be referring back to its material often I have read the book twice as was suggested by the author and will continue to read it many times more  It is that indispensable and that is why it is still relevant over 70 years after its original publication  The only significant flaw was that many of the anecdotes were outdated by current standards  but again that is not the fault of Carnegie  Overall  this book is definitely worth at least a single read  Nope One of the BEST books I have ever read  Read when I turned 20 and completely changed the way I communicated with others  I learnt how to not criticise condemn or complain  and lots of other handy tips  Dale Carnegie  is one of the classic self motivation guru s this book was first published in 1936 sold over 15 million copies  Everyone should read this book every few years  Not because it is mind boggling  revolutionary  etc  But because it is a great reminder of how we should interact with people in everyday life  I liked all the stories  One word    Legendary  that s it  Really amazing book  Creo que necesito leerlo unas 10 veces mas  Excelente libro  Should be required reading  Apart from the Book of Mormon and the Bible  this is one of the greatest book to make a person more christ like and happy in this life Dale Carnegie teaches that as we be nice to be people  listening to them  consider their point of view  appreciate what they do  help them in their goals  and smile that we will achieve what we want  and feel satisfaction for it Read this book  Paul Graham  Hackers and Painters  has mentioned that an important read for preparing to start your own business is How To Win Friends and Influence People  I m happy to report that this gem from 1936 is timeless and truly life changing  I believe Paul s reasons for the recommendation include  the importance of charisma  general rounding out one s personality  and finding ways to get responsiveness from people by making them feel good My real intent in making this review is to get you to pick up a copy of this book and absorb every nugget  so your relationships will increase and improve One complaint I have is that the table of contents does not very well summarize the maxims  They are  however  listed in a table at the end of each of the sections  I ll combine them here by their major sections Fundamentals for handling people  Don t be critical  Be sincerely appreciative  not flattering  Arouse in the other person an eager want  by focusing on their needs instead of yours Making people like you  Get others to do most of the talking  Listen well  and make them feel important  Then they ll feel so good about being listened to that they ll do anything for you Win people to your way of thinking  Always start in a friendly way  and be dramatic  See things from the other person s point of view  and be sympathetic with that view Leadership  Give lots of genuine praise  and be encouraging  Talk about your own mistakes first  and make his faults seem easy to correct  Ask questions instead of giving orders  Give the other person person a fine reputation to live up to  and let him save face Some of the lessons in the book are especially challenging to apply  e g   making other people feel like your ideas are their own  A fundamental part of an entrepreneur s livelihood is idea generation  But ideas supposedly are not terribly valuable on their own  it s the execution that counts   so maybe this maxim is still valid  This seems to underscore the importance of having a lot of trust in your business partner s  I ve noticed that a lot of people don t call me by my name  maybe just because it s slightly uncommon  I do make an effort to remember someone s name and use it with some frequency  It was encouraging to hear Carnegie underscore this  He s right    it does feel good when someone addresses me properly I m going to change my approach to making requests of people  I have a habit of getting right to the point and immediately stating what I want and why  That s probably why so many of my requests go unanswered  A general theme in the book is that getting what you want involves some indirection  I e   think of things from the other person s perspective and present things from an angle of how they are the beneficiary Overall  lots of Carnegie s ideas are common sense  but it still was useful to hear him voice them  Some of the principles are not so obvious and I probably wouldn t have ever discovered them on my own  I toted this book around with me for a couple weeks and found that having the ideas fresh in my head greatly improved my interactions with people  For this reason  I think this book  or its summary  would be highly valuable to skim over before every important meeting  This book is wonderful and timeless  The principles it teaches are easily applied to life situations and it has made me rethink the way I ve been handling people  Its opened my eyes to a lot of behaviors that I ve displayed that only hurt my relationships to people  I m going to read this book at least once every year because it is so important to have these human relation skills  It has also been a great tool for combating anxiety issues  If you r a good person  this book will influence u to become a better person  Truly amazing  worth reading    Simple but practical principles to help you live a better  more fulfilling life  A book that I can see myself rereading a year or two from now  If only I had read this sooner  The advices in Dale Carnegie s How to win friends and influence people are easy to practice and hard to forget  It teaches how to resolve and avoid conflicts  as well as valuable leadership skills  Although winning friends may be from another era  Adding friends  might be more relevant  the lessons still apply today As I was reading the book I realised the amount of conflicts I could have handled better and the amount of lost opportunities I ve missed  I ll recommend everybody to read this at least once  especially the ones who have to work with people  very rarely do people work completely alone  or manage them  10 10 would recommend and I look forward to catching up on his other books  Fantastic  Super practical advice for handling the title  6 stars  What every person should read at an early age and frequently re read  Our lives  professionaI  family and personal  would all be so much more enjoyable and fulfilling  I wish I had read this in High School  It would have saved me many a hard lesson at West Point and as a young officer  Reading Dale Carnegie s examples from the classics and early 20th Century America  anyone will realize just how enduring his comments on human nature are and how relevant his lessons in leadership and getting the most out of people remain today  A must read for any military  civic or business leader  Probably one of the most influential Professional Life Advice books I have read in my early 20s along with Never Eat Alone and Lynchpin  lktb ry   w shyq jd    stfdt kthyr mnh w s Tbq n sh llh m t lmth    nSH ljmy  bqrth w tdwyn lmlHZt lhm  thn lqr   This book surely must be a classic  Although it s written quite a while ago  the main ideas of this book are still used to this very day  I believe anyone can find this book useful  It is simple  right to the point  including good examples I also liked how the author mentioned the way this book is supposed to be read and used  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone  no matter the age  I am looking forward myself to re read it and come back to it s main points from time to time  ktb ry   jdan   stfdt mnh kthyran  It s not as Machiavellian as the name suggests  It should be called  how to be a decent person   It should also be mandatory for anyone teaching at any level  and on any subject    Totally not about what most people think its about everyone should read this book the world would be a better place Vous detestez lire des livres relies au travail et souhaiteriez n avoir qu un seul ouvrage de reference a consulter en toutes situations  Ce livre est pour vous Mon top 1 du meilleur livre de psycho travail relations humaines EVER    Le titre est toutefois trompeur  il aurait du s intituler quelque chose comme   Comment manipuler les gens de facon elegante et subtile   Ecrit en 1936 par un Etats

a great guide to improving human relations  As you read  you will find many opportunities to apply the lessons to your own life  Skills acquired while reading this book include  becoming a better listener  becoming less self centered  discovering motivations of others and realizing we all basically want the same things out of life  how to tactfully go about getting the things you want from other people  avoiding unnecessary conflicts confrontations  etc    Some of Carnegie s advice may seem like  tricks  or sales tactics used to essentially manipulate people  but I ve found the results of practicing these principles to be positive  Anything which encourages harmony between myself and others is welcome in my life  I saw results immediately as I began to apply the lessons I learned from this book  and received positive  unsolicited feedback about my changing attitude and performance at work  and improvements in other relationships  Overall  very insightful and applicable   I thought this was a really good book considering it was written in the 60 s  Maybe there s an updated version  but there was language in there that i just didn t understand  What are Hollyhocks  Buku yang amat sangat bagus  penting  perlu untuk dibaca dan juga langsung dipraktekkan dalam kehidupan kita  Terutama bagi orang yang ingin meningkatkan kualitas hubungan sesama manusia di semua segmen  entah itu di dalam keluarga  hubungan bisnis  maupun dalam sosial kemasyarakatan  Everyone should read this book  Still so relevant almost 100 years later  It is a great book that has tips that are always useful  I feel I should read it more often as it applies so much in life in general  not only in business  I really want to study this book  Common sense stuff  but is so true  Some of it gets dry and I just skimmed it  but I found myself nodding and underlining  and Making comments in the margins   which i don t do  even though this was written in the 1930s  everything is still extremely applicable and timeless  and obvious  just not so obvious that you think of it yourself  This book should be taught in all high schools  I can t believe it s not part of the curriculum  If it was  we d have a much better set of youth That said  if you understand the power of one to one marketing  this is the defining book for it  You  essentially  don t need to read anything else  This is an annual read for me  Without a doubt  the single most important book I ve ever read  Illuminating read on how to deal with common social situations  What I don t necessarily agree with is the author s idea that everyone is a narcissist and dogmatic person  However  much of the book s content will behoove me when dealing with people and being a leader  Will definitely have to reread and review Carnegie s core principles to win friends and influence people  Despite the dorky name  this book definitely influenced my life for the better  I was 16  and no one had ever told me that you might make people like you if you smiled at them when they were talking  Revelations  That book has showed me has to be a better  pleasing and kind person Must read of self development literature  If you want to learn about leadership  start with this book  I have read this book no less than 6 times  It is one of the most influential books in my business life   First read May 27   July 26  2014  Second read was listening to audio book  May 2015  Terrific book about how to be a better  nicer person Despite the gimmicky title  a phenomenal book that should just be titled  How to be a nice person  One of my three books I think EVERYONE should read   I wish all people would take the time to read this book  Read it in high school and re read it again a few years ago  Love this book  This is one of the best books I ve read  It helps me to change the way I communicate and think  It s really hard to apply but I am willing to do it if I want to be successful in life    Highly recommended     Must read  Wow  What a book  It s hard to believe it was written so long ago  This is really a must read for everyone who cares about relationships   which should be everyone  Dale just forces you to think about how everyone percieves your actions and words  It s really a guide humble communication  I will make this required reading for my employees  One of the must read in your life  This book is one of those books where you will read the advice and think  Duh  that is so simple   and then realize that you have not been following that advice very much  The book covers many different types of interactions with people and each chapter begins with a simple goal such as  Win People to Your Way of Thinking  and then spends each section expounding upon a simple principle that can be summed in a simple sentence such as  Get the other person saying  yes  yes  immediately   Through out section  Carnegie sprinkles stories involving ordinary people and famous people and how they use that particular principle to influence people  Interestingly  the book is written in such a positive fashion that you don t really consider the unethical uses of the principles  The emphasis all the way through out the book is gaining a deeper empathy for your fellow human beings and how to avoid resolve conflicts  The book is a breath of fresh air compared to some of the Pick Up Artist or Sales Techniques modern books on persuasion  After reading this book  you will genuinely want to go out and influence people to make the world a better place My favorite quote from the boo was when Carnegie is talking about one of the strongest drives that a human being has is the desire to feel important  In middle of tlaking about how this can be used to influence people  especially their first impressions of you   he drops a little statement that is much deeper than it orignally appears  He says   If you tell me how you get your feeling importance  I ll tell you what you are   From that simple little sentence comes an easy to use heuristic that can let us understand other people s behavior that we find so baffling  When I was reading the book  this statement smacked me between the eyes like a sledgehammer and I had to stop reading to be able unpack what the statement really means  All too often we focus too closely on just the actions or the results of those actions for a person  that we never attempt to uncover why they are doing something  You can have two people doing the same thing for completely different reasons and then they both do the exact opposite and it can be quite baffling  This is isn t a big deal  we all know this  but the reasons that people do things are tied strongly to what makes them feel important  And important in this case has a very broad definition outside of famous or well known or popular  people derive all sorts of feelings of importance from doing things that will never be seen by the vast majority of other people  They seek to find their reason for existence and the purpose of their life  If you can figure out where they get their importance  how they place themselves in the universe  then your words can resonate deeply with them   This book has motivated me in many ways  When someone did something good or bad  I used to think    What would I do If I m in their s place     Now I m thinking like   I would do the same thing if I m in their place  no doubt the Best book on interpersonal relationships  if you want to be a leader of any organisation  church  etc this book is a must read  It s hard to rate this book  instead I ll call it    essential   This is a must read for people who have to interact with other people  a k a  everyone  One of my favorite books I thought it was an amazing guide to help someone without the natural skills to function within the sensitive office political domain  Highly Recommend it  An incredibly insightful and useful book that will change my life for the better Really changed my life  Very basic tenets that people should naturally follow  I honestly cannot commend a book more and have gone out of my way to suggest others read this marvelous book   This is my  1  favorite book of all times  I have no words to recommend it  if you have never heard about it you must read it and follow all the advices by heart  I do recommend it  a classic  I just re read this with my kids and though some of the examples and ideas are outdated  overall  the concepts are absolutely genius  I have already seen a huge change in the way our kids deal with each other  with me  with others  and with how I interact with others also  We will probably re read this book every few years  A must read  great people skills book Simple yet profound Great guidelines and rules for handling your interactions with people in all areas of life The best book on interpersonal relationships  Great read that will definitely help in life A lot of great wisdom in this book  In fact I took the highlights and put them into the notes of my phone so that I can review them on a regular basis  We are working with people on an everyday basis  whether it be in a personal business  family or even an employee at some store we shop  This book offers that practical wisdom that helps you to understand people  therefore allowing you to work better with them  One of the most influencing books I ve ever read  It really gets you thinking about your actions  Dale has changed many lives through this book  It s on many top 100 lists  I recommend it to everyone  It s definitely a must read

mamy mowic o tym  czego sami chcemy  To dziecinne  I bez sensu  Oczywiscie  ze interesuje cie to  czego chcesz  Interesuje cie to wiecznie  Ale innych nie interesuje to zupelnie  Niczym sie od ciebie nie roznimy  interesuje nas to  czego chcemy my  Wlasnie za takie cytaty jak dwa powyzsze uwielbiam Carnegiego A ponizszy cytat tez jest bardzo dobry  kiedys zapewne przytocze go w notce  Cokolwiek zrobiles od dnia swoich narodzin  zrobiles  poniewaz chciales  Pytasz o dzien  w ktorym przeslales spora dotacje dla Czerwonego Krzyza  To tez nie jest wyjatek  Przeznaczyles pieniadze na Czerwony Krzyz  poniewaz chciales podac komus pomocna dlon  chciales dokonac pieknego  altruistycznego  swietego czynu    Cokolwiek uczyniliscie jednemu sposrod tych braci moich najmniejszych  mniescie uczynili   Gdybys bardziej pragnal pieniedzy niz tego szlachetnego uczucia  nigdy nie przeslalbys tej dotacji   A jednak rownie czesto jak ja spotykasz ludzi  ktorzy ida przez zycie usilujac wszelkimi sposobami zwrocic na siebie uwage  Oczywiscie  to do niczego nie prowadzi  Ludzie nie interesuja sie toba  Nie interesuja sie tez mna  O kazdej porze dnia i nocy interesuja sie wylacznie soba  Powyzszy   po raz kolejny potwierdza tylko to samo  Ale lubie sobie to uswiadamiac  PA ponizsze dwa    warto o tym pamietac  Zachowuj sie tak  jakbys juz byl szczesliwy  a zobaczysz  ze faktycznie bedziesz szczesliwy  Oto co pisze o tym filozof i psycholog William James    Dzialanie wydaje sie isc za uczuciem  ale w rzeczywistosci dzialania i uczucia sa rownoczesne  Regulujac dzialanie  ktore znajduje sie pod bardziej bezposrednia kontrola woli  mozemy posrednio wplynac na uczucia  ktore nie sa kierowane przez wole   Ilekroc wychodzisz na zewnatrz miej radosna mine  nos glowe wysoko  jakbys mial na niej korone  i do samego dna nabieraj powietrze w pluca  Upijaj sie sloncem  witaj znajomych usmiechem i w kazdy uscisk dloni wkladaj cala dusze  Nie obawiaj sie  ze zostaniesz zle zrozumiany  i nie trac ani minuty na myslenie o wrogach  Sprobuj jasno nakreslic sobie w umysle cel  do ktorego zmierzasz  a potem skieruj sie tam bez zbaczania z drogi  Nie przestawaj myslec o wielkich i wspanialych rzeczach  ktore chcesz zrobic  a wraz z uplywem dni przekonasz sie  ze podswiadomie chwytasz wszystkie sposobnosci do spelnienia marzen  tak jak koralowce wychwytuja z przeplywajacej fali wszystkie potrzebne im skladniki     Pamietaj  ze ludzie  z ktorymi rozmawiasz  stokroc bardziej przejeci sa soba i swoimi problemami niz toba i sprawami  ktore de trapia  Bol zeba znaczy dla kazdego wiecej niz glod  ktory w Chinach zabija miliony ludzi  Problem  ktory musimy rozwiazac interesuje nas bardziej niz czterdziesci trzesien ziemi w Afryce  Pamietaj o tym  kiedy nastepnym razem rozpoczniesz konwersacje   Czy chcialbys poznac magiczna formule  ktora rozstrzygnie spory  wyeliminuje zlosc  spowoduje dobra wole i sprawi  ze rozmowca bedzie de sluchal uwaznie  Chcialbys  Dobrze  Oto ona    Nie winie cie ani na jote za to  co czujesz  Gdybym byl toba  bez watpienia czulbym to samo   Takie stwierdzenie zmiekczy nawet najbardziej swarliwego rozmowce pod sloncem  A mozesz to powiedziec i byc stuprocentowo szczery  poniewaz gdybys byl na miejscu tej drugiej osoby  z pewnoscia myslalbys tak jak ona  Powyzszy tez jest dobry    Antoine de Saint Exupery napisal    Nie mam prawa robic ani mowic czegokolwiek  co pomniejsza czlowieka w jego wlasnych oczach  Liczy sie nie to  co ja mysle o nim  lecz to  co on mysli o sobie samym  Uwlaczanie godnosci czlowieka jest przestepstwem   Tu sie zgadzam  I read  How to Win Friends and Influence People  as homework for the Dale Carnegie class  Breakthrough to Success   This book is an excellent toolkit for getting what you want out of life and work  The principles are practical and effective  I ve put many of them into practice at home and at work  and have enjoyed better relationships and quicker

multiple times in their life  Your success in life will be directly correlated with your ability to communicate and build relationships  The rules of this book should be memorized until they are engrained with your everyday thought processes  I have seen lists of over hyped books with this book on it  I feel like those writers are trying to do something outrageous to get people to read their articles  This book was decades ahead of it s time when management viewed people as things to be controlled   Interesting stuff  Probably will read this once a year I believe  if read thoroughly  this book can act ask an incredile source of advice  Upon getting hired for my job  I was required to read this book  Though I was somewhat frusterated that I was essentially being forced to read  my mood quickly changed once I realized how great the book was  Carnegie does an impressive job of offering real life examples in order to make his insight both relateable and sincere  I plan to read this book several times throughout my life  One of those books that you walk away a better person from  Truly empowering  Pick it up and change your life  A really great book that I read years ago  The main concept is something you can put into practice  to actually be interested in other people  what they are saying  etc  will win you friends and influence people  It may  however  work too well  If you are always the good listener  and interested in others  you may attract many people who love to talk  indeed are compulsive talkers  and will take up all your time   I have seen this book many times in book shops but the title always put me off  I thought it sounded a bit  sales gimmicky   It is a must read for anyone who manages people and psychology students  Although it is an old book the examples given still make it an interesting read  It is basically about treating people with respect  putting yourself in their shoes  and being sincere with praise  I wish I had read it when doing my behaviour diploma as it would have made an excellent reference tool   Absolutely amazing  This book has literally changed my life   Awesome book  a must read for any professional  Well written and with precise exercises on how to do exactly what the title says I m on the last stretch of this book  and what I ve learned thus far has been the most practical and enlightening insight to the day to day workings of social psychology I ve ever come across  Everyone  everywhere  could benefit tremendously from the lessons and advice in this book  I read this years ago  Guessing at the date  I revisit it occasionally just because it made me more tolerant of other people s views  I would say it is one of my favorite informational books  if not my favorite  I also like John Wooden  You can be right  or you can be kind   I am not sure if this was in the book  but I think it captures a lot of what I got from the book  There is much more  I m sure  but my memory              mhm

this book needs to be given a hand clap that can be heard around the world  Literally  We read books that not only teach us how to perfect our craft  but our character as well  How to Win Friends   Influence People by Dale Carnegie is highly recommended text for those looking to improve their attitudes towards people and especially potential clients  The main rules to learn in this book are The six ways to make people like youThe twelve ways to win people to your way of thinkingThe nine ways to change people without arousing resentmentHow to    is a book we plan to keep on our desks as a personal character bible when certain situations arise  The most important lesson we both learned was remembering a person s name is the sweetest and most important sound in any language  In other words  don t perceive your clients as just that  your  client   They do have a name  Respect it  Live it  Remember it  Amazing that this book was published in 1936  It s amazingly replete with insights into human nature that are spot on  Mostly intuitive  but chock full of anecdotes and stories that support his points  If you interact with human beings you should probably read this book  loved it Dale Carnegie s How to Win Friends and Influence people is the enduring self help classic  written originally 1937 to wild acclaim  that keeps on giving charmingly charismatic advice for success in both work and society  Focusing on other people s strengths and striving to genuinely like and show interest in them  we win their admiration and trust  Then we can make them do stuff  It s not really that easy  of course  but this book is a refreshing reminder to use encouragement rather than the intimidation which only engenders resentment  to deftly nudge others around you into becoming the best they can be  which is  let s admit it  your minion  While reading this  I often thought to myself that it was like a paraphrase of so much of Jesus  teachings  that we should love others unconditionally  sometimes requiring extensive use of our imaginations   that the first would be last  that we should give of ourselves to extremity without thought of what we would gain  and that others would follow and do even greater things as a result  By applying these principles  which still seem to go against to our natural negative inclinations despite evolution and modern science and all that  we all would win  wouldn t we  If yes  then click like on this review  I work with hundreds and hundreds of people every year  so I figured this book could do me no harm  From beginning to end  I was hooked  The principles in here are really common sense principles  but it s good to be reminded of the power that our words and actions have on others  As a teachers is so important that I  win over  my students  quickly  This book gave me the tools I need to do just that  I believe this is a must read book for everyone  Absolutely this is the best book on friendships relationships and how to interact with people ever  So obvious  but overlooked Even though it was written so many years ago and some of the examples he gave might seem a little curious now  the principles still apply and it s a simple and fun way to improve your social skills and get to master human relationships  My learning  1  If you disagree with someone  you may be tempted to interrupt  But don t  It is dangerous  They wont pay any attention to you  They still have lot of ideas crying to find their way to expression  2  Dont you have more faith in your own ideas than those offered to you on a silver plate  If yes  then it applies the same way when we offer our ideas to others  Offer ideas only if asked  and even after that  retract and let them make their own decision  3  A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall  Speak softly  Be polite  4  Humility and praise  when rightfully used  can work miracles in human relations  5  Praise is like sunlight to the warm human spirit  We cannot grow without it  6  We might do the same thing as others  given the same circumstances  7  Teaching children to count is important  Teaching them what counts is critical  8  Even God does not judge  Who are you and me  9  The deepest urge in human nature is the desire to feel important  Make people feel important and they would do anything for you  10  Be lavish in appreciation  People will cherish and treasure your words  and repeat them till years after you have forgotten them  11  the rare individual who unselfishly tries to help others has little competition in this world  He need not worry about his future  12  You can make more friends in two months by becoming genuinely interested in other people that you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you  13  People are not interested in you and me  They are interested in themselves  When you see a group photograph that you are in  whose picture do you look at first  14  There is nothing either good or bad  Our thinking about it makes it so  15  A person s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language  16  When your child talks to you  stop everything else and listen  There is nothing more respectful and lovable as listening  17  Many people call a doctor when all they need is a good audience  18  Any fool can try to defend his or her mistake  and most fools do  In opinion the concepts in this book should be taught in school   A classic   life lessons and examples from Abraham Lincoln still apply to life today   What a wonderful book  So much of the world is full of negativity anymore  This book  though dated in its examples  is a refreshing guide to life and interacting with others  I HIGHLY recommend this book to everyone  but especially those whose vocation requires working with other and leadership  What can I say   this is an amazing book  Truly a book about finding the best in others and encouraging them to be the best they can be  which in turn benefits everyone  Very inspiring  Standards to live by  I d recommend this to anyone who wonders why they have no friends  A book every one must read This should be part of school curriculum  Extremely powerful and numerous tips that I will be using for everyday life A classic which may never lose its edge  A book full of examples of how famous personalities individuals influenced  Many simple and effective tools are mentioned towards building long lasting relationships Surely a primer for anybody interested in connecting with people  I have been in business for 35 years and I recomend this book to all new managers  It goes to the heart of what business is all about   people  Livre tres interessant qui cache beaucoup plus de ressources que ce que ne laisserait penser le titre Un certain nombre de principes a mettre en oeuvre pour se sentir mieux avec soi et avec les autres    Not as manipulative as it sounds  more about self improvement  A lot of the points you would think are common sense but   Anyway  I thought the author wrote splendidly plus he really did his research which helped to back up his points  I especially liked this book because I read one of the first editions published so it was neat to see some of the different cultural aspects at the time come out in the writing  which I assume are edited out in the other editions   Classic  Enough said  it s really nice to know yourselves guys   This book is a must read for anyone who will communicate with others   personally or professionally   at some point in their life  In other words  this book is for everyone This is the absolute BEST book I have ever read for evidence based  research and practical  suggestions on how to effectively communicate with the people in your life  Carnegie provides real life examples and scenarios from historical  as well as personal  experiences that clearly and humorously illustrate how to positively influence others and achieve win win results I couldn t put this book down  It is the only self help business book I continually refer back to while consistently implementing the suggestions  with success  This book has improved my interactions with everyone in my personal AND professional life  It truly has changed my life for the better  Livro muito dinamico mas com conceitos complexos  A aplicacao e essencial juntamente com a releitura regular para a fixacao dos mesmos  This book is a must read on human relations  It explains the value of understanding people from an empathetic point of view  It not only helps you improve yourself  but it enhances the way you can treat others  This is a book I must read every year  Really helps to read this in order to keep communication open and positive  I think that EVERYONE should read this book  It is amazing Fantastic  I loved all of his suggestions  Most of them seen like common sense because the author suggests well known behaviors such as smiling  complimenting others  listening sincerely  and asking good questions  But  the stories he uses to exemplify each principle are very interesting and convincing  I ll have to read this book again sometime to refresh   LOVED it  EVERYONE should read this   Dale Carnegie Classic  Must read for all  The way i see it its a great programme to be followed to get better   Big things have small beginnings    Changing our behaviour with small steps will lead to a better world  A must read   I m beginning this book for the third time in four years  It s that good  Reminders of how to live your life    and be a better person  Should be read more than once  My all time favorite book  Read it so many times I lost count  I try to apply more and more of what s in it as time goes on  I m not always successful at it but I always try  The advice contained in it really does work if you have the discipline to apply it   I love it  Right to my noose  Never thought it was the art of learning behavior on human beings  Its simple but yet so complex for a human beings  affectionate by their needs  My bedtime read  after stress reading on financial and economic  Interesting  for now and future  always forever  Thanks  classictrue classicthis is what Seven Habits and all books like it are based i will read this again and again   its lessons are timeless This book gets hated on sometimes  but I found it at a time I was struggling with my sense of confidence with other people  and it was just what I needed  my life follow this book I reread this book every so often because it is just so illuminating  If you ever have to deal with people  ever  this book is for you   Brilliant book  helping you understand and thus influence the behaviour of others ktb ssy lmn yryd lnjH fy Hyth ktb y lm ldblwmsy  w lHkm  w lHlm yjb n tqr h  As corny as the title might sound  this book should be a must read on everyone s list  After reading this book I am so surprised that schools don t teach the simple methods for people to get along with each other and have less conflict  On top of it  any person going into any sort of business must read this  The advice that this book gives is more valuable than a college education on business  While reading this book  I ve already had a lot of success  whether it s dealing with work  friends  or family  There s nothing to lose  this book was enjoyable and fast and on top of it  I read every single chapter twice over and took notes  as Dale Carnegie suggests in the beginning of the book and I would suggest the same thing to anyone planning on reading it  Don t miss out   it s like a manuel to life  Compared with what we ought to be  we are only half awake    from Pt  4  Chapter 6  love it  well written  simple and spot on I need to read this and reread    The best books    are those that tell you what you know already   How to Win Friends and Influence People   One of the best books I have ever read  A must book Without which I may still be friendless   give me motivation onhow to win mad u    Very  very useful to someone as socially ignorant as me  Essential read alongside Influence by Robert Cialdini  Very clearly focused  achieve the goal as defined by the title of the book  by increasing the awareness of how other people judge  Attempts to help not be rhetoric  but by actual improvement of characteristics such as diplomacy  felling and expressing genuine appreciation of other people  One of the most helpful books you ll ever read  whether you think you need it or not Quite possibly the best sef help motivational book that I have read The concepts and ideas provided are very simple  However  it is the simple things in life that we tend to forget  Everyone at one point in their life should read this book because it will only help them become a better person Although  the book was published in 1936  the ideas are still highly applicable more than ever in today s world There is a reason why this book has sold 15 million copies world wide  A book that can make you befriend people  and yourself  One of the most helpful books every to help you avoid arguments  6 star book  best one I ve read since Thomas Sowell s Basic Economics Applicable advice for dealing with people  While not mentioned specifically by the author  many of his points come from Biblical principles  Biggest take away  no point in arguing with someone and try to prove them wrong  This will only cause them to  dig in  in their position  Their pride will then be involved  Author postulates that arguing is a lose lose proposition  Even if you  win  the author person will resent you  You cannot win an argument and its best to avoid them  even if you are right  Author uses examples from 1900s 1930s  Charles Schwaube maybe worth reading about  Also  Dale Carnegie reference Lincoln frequently  He even wrote a biography about him  This is probably worth reading as well   Allen  This book did NOT change my life  It says a whole lot of things that I would hope most people will learn through trial and error while growing up  I was already in my mid thirties by the time I came around to reading it I m also pretty sure that I would not have taken this book very seriously when I was still a young man  either However  this did help me tune my knowledge  It helped me realize that certain habits I have are particularly useful when dealing with others  and it helped me realize that certain habits that I don t have are still things that I  even now     five years later     still need to do more to work on For me  the biggest help was the book explaining that  I am bad with names  is NOT an excuse to not remember them  I absolutely recommend this book  but I warn that it is a self improvement book  You have to WANT to work on your own betterment to get any value at all from it  Project management is essentially people management  Without the right social skills  you re going to be more dangerous to your team than effective  This classic book on social interaction is still as relevant today as when it was released over 80 years ago  Not only will you learn how to make yourself accessible to and valued by others  but you ll also become a better manager because of it  most helpful book on communication with people  Written almost 80 years ago and it is still as useful today as it was when it was written  I truly believe everyone should read this book  My only regret in reading it  is not reading it years ago  It has changed my perspective in my relationships with all people and really has opened my eyes to the truths of human nature Second reading  all people who have relationships with people need to read this book  It s applicable not only in business  but for families   marriages as well  This was a great book and I recommend it to everyone   This book is awesome  one of my favourite  I didn t read this edition yet  but did read the Chinese edition  which already gave me tons of inspirations  and changed my attitude of communication and social activities  Now I am able to understand the right way for conversation  and makes me think more too  I love this book  surely one of the must read books here on earth  What did I learn    Smile  learn from other people  get to know them   be what I want people around me to be like and people really do want to talk to you    they are probably just as scared as you are  that may have been from another book but I think it is from this one    lol   Dale Carnegie s classic has a deservedly fabulous reputation  The title does indeed capture the intent of the book  it s a pragmatic how to manual for getting people to like you and do what you want  It is thus a self help book  no different from any other self help book about advancing your career or succeeding in life  But  pleasingly  because the advice largely consists of being genuinely nice to people  giving praise whenever possible  listening to what other people have to say  and so forth   the book is really about constructing so called  win win  situations  in which you get what you want and everyone else is happy that you did  So  it s a book about being selfish and generous at the same time  What a pleasing idea for any aspiring capitalist who fancies himself or herself a moral human being  I find it very pleasing that Carnegie emphasizes that your words and actions must be genuine  praise  rather than false  flattery   While the writing style may seem a little dated  and the claims that these techniques are the only ones overblown  the advice given is as valuable today as it was when the book was first published in 1937  It s tempting to dismiss it all as obvious  and  indeed  much of the wisdom in the book has passed into the realm of conventional wisdom amongst professional business people  But  while I find myself saying  I do that  often enough  I certainly also found myself saying  Oh  I know I should do that  but sometimes I don t  even more often  And  by having all the ideas in a single book  and uppermost in my consciousness  I ve found that I m trying hard to build relationships on a daily basis   Just yesterday  I decided to try to make friends with Eugene  who came to repair our stove  and with some success    Given the importance of personal relationships in business    and  for that matter  in life    if you haven t read this book  you should do so now  And  if you have read it  it s probably time to read it again  I plan to read it cover to cover on an annual basis  Excellent communications book  Very clear and simple to understand   Recommended read  one of Dale Carnegie s classic  There aren t a lot of books that I purchase and even less that I find myself reading more than once  but I have read this twice in one year and encourage many others to read it  A great book on how to deal with people in the business world as well as with friends   I really like this book  It s an really helpful book because it teaches me how to be positive and have a better relationship with other people  In the story  Dale Carnegie  the author  told about his life experiences  For example  he once faced a big problems  but instead of feeling depressed  he tried to think positively  and the problem was solved shortly after  This book really helps me on how to face problems and solve them easily without any troubles  This book is a must read for anyone who works with people  It gives great insight into the minds of people and how they want you to treat them  This book can truly transform your relationships  Many similar books have been written  but few compare   Currently in the early chapters  Must take notes on this info and try to read it slowly  Most of the points herein are pretty obvious  but they re also easy things to forget  How to Win Friends and Influence People was written by Dale Carnegie and published in 1936  By now 15 million copies of the book have been sold worldwide  This is said to be the first self help book ever published I listened to the audio book only a few days ago  What an excellent book it is  This should have reached me a couple of years ago before I took some unwise decisions in both my personal and professional life  The book tells you how to win friends and retain them by not hurting them yet getting your things done  I have not been as smart as Carnegie in those areas  I have made a lot of friends and lost some of the best of them due to my impatience  I should have dealt with them in a more diplomatic way  But there was no Carnegie book with me those days I don t think I am late  It is never too late  I can start NOW  I am 41 now  I can win my friends back  I can win what I lost now  well except one thing  You can guess what I used to criticize people in public and even through media for their faults with the hope that they would correct themselves  But I don t think anybody was corrected by my criticisms  Instead they became hostile with me and attacked me fiercely whenever and wherever they could  It cost me dearly  I should have been shrewd with them  Criticizing doesn t bring good results at all  It only hurts people and make them your enemies  You can attract people by admiring them rather than criticizing  That is what I am going to do from now on  I would have to do it sincerely without flattering them though I had been bad in letter writing too  I have written many emails that hurt people  Those who receive them retaliated  Only few who were educated enough understood my sentiments and took things logically  But many started scathing attacks on me  One has to be very careful in this age of Internet  You should not just hit the send button before reading the email you wrote once more  If the email is on a critical issue  keep it in the draft box at least for another day before sending  Carnegie gives you good examples of how to write good letters in the book The book teaches you how to win people and increase one s influence  prestige and one s ability to get the things done  In fact his ways are very simple when you read  You feel that you complicate simple things by being hasty or impatient  And you make a mess ultimately The book also teaches you how to sell yourself  You can become a better salesman or executive if you follow Carnegie s advice  He will tell you how to win new clients and customers in creative ways The book helps you to handle complaints  avoid arguments  keep your human contacts smooth and pleasant  It will also help make you a better speaker and a more entertaining conversationalist As a whole  after reading the book  you will become a totally changed individual who can take life positively  You will also be a more productive person who can take intelligent decisions in both your personal and professional life It is said that the billionaire businessman Warren Buffett took the Dale Carnegie course  How to Win Friends and Influence People  when he was 20 years old and to this day has the diploma in his office  This is a book I will probably re read yearly because it was so great  So many great tips for being a better person and getting along with others  Everyone should read this book  so practical  will definitely read and reference again and again    Dear Dad  45 years ago you so wanted me to read this book that you offered to pay me  10 if I did it  Well  Dad  I finally did  And I now see why you thought so highly of this book and how it shaped you so profoundly  and then  how you shaped me so profoundly    I thought it was going to be trivial and trite  just a bunch of  positive thinking  type stuff  Instead  I found it full of real wisdom and insight And every page reminded me of you Love Mike A timeless classic  It sometimes catches me by surprise when I hear someone attributing their success in part to this book among a couple of other classics  It shouldn t though  Times may change  Fads may come and go  Each generation may seem more cynical than the last  Human nature pretty much stays the same  Absolutely Fantastic    Nothing I say will do it justice  it has to be read   This book gives you the keys to human relations  social skills  and sometimes just common courtesy  I recommend this book be read by ANYONE who works with people   sales  retail  CEO s  and guys just starting out at the bottom rung   this will change your life   A nice book  Very good lessons about human nature  It gives basics for behavior   With 1965 reviews before mine  I don t think I am able to pay this book any compliment that hasn t been paid by someone else  but like many other best selling inspirational books   How to Win Friends   Influence People  got  from many of its readers  little more than  pure inspiration   How many  after reading and praising this book  would be able to claim really applying the rules presented in the book as guidance of their everyday interaction with the others  Not too many  I m afraid  otherwise the effect should be easily felt  The inconvenient fact is  people are egoistic and self centered  and often fail to realize that others are as egoistic and self centered as themselves  To recognize the existence of such traits as part of human nature is to acknowledge their existence in one s self  So  to insist on applying the rules set out in the book  while not having too high expectation on being reciprocated  requires a strong sense of purpose and some serious will power   This book is literally the best book in human relations of all timeThis book is priceless It is very affective Its instructions are very powerful that it works instantly This book really makes you win friends and influence people with honesty and Sincerity    REST IN PEACE MR DALE With over 15

a book that must be revisited at least once a year A must read and a must on everyone s book shelf Vivek Rajan Vivek A Great Sage and A Rascal Named Dokuwww vivekrajanvivek com Fabulous     I took notes in my journal and refer to them often   This a classic in the study of communication  What is now considered common sense  Carnegie lays out in rules and applications  Very good advice about communicating with people in an honest and productive manner  Gets a little repetitive in the second half  but is all in all an engaging read  I learned these principles when I was young  Everyone should commit them to their heart   ktb qym lktb rfy  lmstw     krnjy stT   n yqdm nmwdhj llnsn ldhy ytHrk byjby  wbHkm  fy jmy  mwqf lHy   mn lmw sf  n nr  Gyr lmslmyn ysbqwn ls d lbshry   n Tryq lmnhj lswy  fy l ysh    wnHn  SHb lwHy  Timeless  Allthough I can t agree with every part of the psychology  this is a very worthy read  Many of the principles are right in line with loving your neighbor and becoming a servant to others  I loved all the anecdotes as well  Timeless  Well  perhaps times are a little more complicated now but the basic principles remain the same Couldn t be a better book  Applicable for any job and multiple relationship  both business and personal  So good  In my opinion  one of the best books ever written  Timeless classic   Sections paragraphs are outdated  but overall this book is full of common sense  yet oftentimes forgotten  keys to successful social interactions  I have a growing list of people for whom  I think  this book would be VERY helpful    CLASSIC    I try to read this every year to remind myself of the  Social Rules   Understanding that people skills are indispensable to a good life is one of my first  aha  moments  Everything you do involves people  This is one book I can read every couple of years  This was written 75 years ago  but is still relevant today  Definitely a staple on my bookshelf   The most life transforming book I ve ever read  In my opinion  everyone should at least read it  if not study it and live by it  World would be a greater place and life easier to live if only that was true  Even if you hate books and can t bring yourself to reading one  I d still recommmend you reading this one  I d force you to if I could   Great classic self help book  This title is misleading  the age of this book is misleading  Sure it was written in the 30s  sure  it sound cheesy  Let me tell you  I don t usually read books like this  and I wasn t sure what I had gotten myself into  That being said  I think everyone needs to read this book  the principals in this book are so important to just being a kind  and considerate human being  If you happen to work with people  which seems like something we cannot escape in our world  or you are a manager  instructor  or overseer   READ THIS BOOK  Honestly  I think this book could be titled   How to Get What You Want   How to Not Be an Asshole   I ve read this book through several times over  but I carry it with me on my daily commute so that I can go back and read another chapter if it s been a while This book has been out there for some time  but its advice still applies today  This is my best example of how his advice helped I was arguing with a bank branch manager who was telling me that the check I was depositing was going to be subject to special holds  At the time  not being able to use the money wasn t critical  but it was inconvenient  and damned annoying since I knew there wasn t any problem with the check  I had raised a points regarding the source of funding  rules on clearing  and level of customer service I was receiving  The manager responded with several points  including  how this was for my protection  My annoyance was heading into anger when I remembered Dale Carnegie s advice to avoid getting into an argument  Once you re in a argument  he said  you re not going to win  no matter how effectively you press your point  I hadn t avoided the argument  but I could still keep from making things worse  I took the check back  and then stopped at the branch that was close to my home  the first branch was close to where I work   There  the branch manager politely asked about the nature of this check  I told him  and things proceeded normally This book provides Dale Carnegie s advice and techniques for interacting with people  but  even more than that  it invites you to adopt an outlook and understanding that people do things based on their beliefs of their valid needs  If you respect that when you re dealing people  you re much more likely to have a better  agreeable outcome   Written in clear and simple language    difficult to apply as i find myself constantly reverting to criticism etc  Need to summarise and put same on my desktop wallpaper Pretty old book with a lame title  but surprisingly relevant and helpful  I can see why it s considered a classic and is still read today  Pretty much everyone can benefit from the things that are in here   The section about home life is more than a little outdated  but considering it was published in 1936  it s understandable   I d say read this book  Do it  This book should be 6th grade mandatory reading  The name really does not fit  If you never took the time to read it please do  This is really an excellent life lesson book  easily one of my favorites I learned an incredible amount from this book  Ideas are great when they seem simple yet profound  and each one of his suggestions are both   Very specific giving examples  its an amazing book to read   The book itself is interesting in that it was published in the 1940s but still provides relevant advice for working with people  Despite technological advancements  the human ego remains unchanged  I am particularly drawn to the stories he tells to bring his point across  It worked much better for me than similar books where you are simply told  this is the way you need to do it    Beautiful   the title almost kept me from reading it  as I thought it sounded a bit manipulative  but this book is SO much more than that  I ll come back and add more  but this is a life changer  It s amazing how simple this book is and how much sense it makes  Why is it that every time I read it I realize that I have forgotten to do everything it says  A timeless classic on how to get along with people on a daily basis  Much of the information is probably already evident to a well mannered ethical person with some experience working with people  It should be especially useful to younger adults  as I don t think this wisdom is taught quite as much as it used to be  I ve read this book several times  It s brilliant   I have read this book cover to cover 3 times  The first time my dad paid me  20 00 and all I wanted to do was finish it as fast as I could  However  the 2nd and 3rd time I read it  I attacked it at a complete different approach  I wanted to actually learn and change and better myself cause of it  It is an excellent read and should be read slowly  Dale tells many great stories  I learned a lot of traits and characteristics from this book that has helped me along in life  I put it on my list of Top 10 of All Time  Most important book ever   after Bible  Should be must read for all adults or even kids  Don t get fulled by the title  It s about how to be better  live better  pay more attention to other people  about healthy relations in business and personal life  You probably haven t read Bible  Tora or whatever your religion is Book so    this one is like essence summary of healthy human relations   might seem to get helpful for You    One of those books everyone should read at least once  Highly recommended to all young professionals  I just love this book  I have read it 4x  I always come away with wanting a better memory and recall about facts and meeting people  Slowly I am applying the tools it taches to do so  Rus  variant Chitaetsia ochen  legko  Glavnaia ideia   bud  proshche i liudi k tebe potianutsia  This is one of the most important books I ve ever read  There is nothing new in this book really  It s just that Carnegie frames the importance of being kind in such a way that the reader feels like they can change the world with only a smile  I checked this one out from the library but I wanted to underline and highlight and make margin notes   so I had to buy a copy from Amazon today  It s that good  Read it at least 3 times in my life  A must read for everyone  I read this book as a young teen and absorbed some of the lessons that Carnegie shares on how to interact effectively with people  Classic  Still worthy of its reputation as one of the best  people skills  books ever written   If you re socially awkward   read this book  This was the first self help book I ever read  I may have been around 12 at the time  and it changed my world  I even wrote out suggestions on cue cards and carried them with me at school and pretty much everywhere  I must say the relationships in my life started to improve markedly once I started applying the suggestions given by Carnegie and it also gave me my first impulse to become more interested in psychology and development   an interest  which has persisted to this day  Although I admit a 12 year old mind can be easily impressed  I still consider this one of the most life changing books I ve ever read and a true classic  I try to read a chapter of this book every day  usually week days   It is hit or miss  but I have read this book at least a dozen times now  I will likely read it many more times  I do this basically just to remind myself of the lessons in the book  Of course  some lessons are more useful than others and I just gloss over the examples he uses as I have read them so many times before   must read book     deep and basic insights in human interactions      I chaned after reading this book A guide on how to be a really nice person Even if you ve read this before  do so again  It keeps you inspired  motivated and on the right track with people   Required reading if you deal with people  like work with people  have a significant other  in a band  have friends  etc  Basically  everyone  Wish I read it 15 years ago  It s up there or even higher than Stephen Covey s 7 Habits  Worth a re read every few years  I learned much of what s in this book the hard way  but somethings are worth reiterating  1  Acknowledge everyone  2  If you think you ve won an argument  you ve actually lost   Pefect book for people skill  You can t succeed with people without reading this book Sufficient instructions and basics which change each of personality    A timeless self help book   the tips in this book hold true today as they did back then  Incredible read if you want to grow as a leader  Timeless tips for growth  I have heard of this book for decads  but finally read it and was very pleasantly surprised  Dale Carnegie had a very conversational style of writing that makes for an easy read  When reading the book  the lessons taught are simple  clear and obvious  but presented in such a way as to give them a fresh insight and application  I ll be reading this book many times  Awesome Piece  Changed my life to a certain extent  This is an awesome book that everyone needs to read  It will make communication a lot easier with friends  family  employees  managers and all else  This is not only a book you need to read  It is a book you need to study  Every chapter is an  aha  moment  I am letting my children read this book because I truly believe that it will help them in many aspects of their lives  Book about work with yourself  Absolutely amazing book on people relations and how to improve them one at a time  The title of it have kept me at bay from reading it any earlier I mean who want s to influence anyone    right  But I was so Wrong    Now I wish I had read it in my teen age or earlier still   I would go on to say that  this is The only book you need for becoming a better person  period Enjoyed it thoroughly  completed it in 3 sessions   so you can guess how engrossing it must have been   D Please if time permits read it once  for I am sure you will like it  if not then just pass it along  This one cost me almost nothing but has value like anything   definitely a reread every 6 months or so      The things that i have read of this book is similar to the other author s books it is hopeful and a good book it does interested me alot with few interesting pointsIt is quite interesting book

for me to date  I recommend to start applying these concepts asap   This book has immensely practical advice on the matters of interpersonal communication  mari mencari kawan sebanyak banyaknya fabulous book  worth reading every few years This was one of the best books that I have ever read It works  Good  When I started reading I thought  come on    Reading a book from 1936 in the 21st century about influencing  But after reading  I was amazed how good  rules  are in the book and they still timely  This is a must read for everyone and the world would be a better and more peaceful place if these rules would be known and be kept  I am at a loss of words  I seldom feel ineffable  but this book has struck the right cord  Nothing could wholly elicit the magnitude of this book s truth  However  I will try to enact my mind s sentiments in the best way possible and to be the bearer of unvarnished truths that this book promotes  I have read many books over the course of the year and none have measured up to the quality of this insightful and completely viable book  The reason I never got around to reading it until now is because I thought I understood human nature  the intricacies that beleaguer us  where our thoughts come from  to how to influence   I ignorantly thought this was an innate power and could not be taught  In turn  I am now flabbergasted I wasted precious time and put off reading this quintessential book until this date  I will not go into detail about everything because I have already kept detailed notes in a file on my computer  However  I will extol the perpetual  and ubiquitous veracities this book so handsomely presents  Dale Carnegie was nothing at his conception until his late teens  He thought about suicide after feeling at loss with himself  but he wanted to make a name for himself  he wanted to fulfill a purpose  He knew athletics and the public speaking at his college were prominent  and knowing he had no athletic abilities he turned his energy to the latter  He studied day and night and lost a myriad competitions  but one day  he prevailed  And as they say  it is history from there  Reading his backstory  along with the many rag to riches stories in this book always fills me with an ambience of eminent power  One day I will be one of them  Furthermore  while reading  everything seems as if it was a truism  yet it needed to be said for me to wholly understand the ways of the human experience  As Carnegie profusely stated  the only way to get the best of this book is to practice  We are creatures of habit and habitual creatures are in need of constant and continuous reinforcement  We must break the bad qualities and ingrain in ourselves the more noble  In addition to the content  the anecdotes and quotes are exceptionally canny  I am a person who puts a lot of thought into what quotes to keep in my common place book  and this book has showed itself to be profound that I extracted the most quotes than any other This book is meant for everyone  This book has no cordons  real or imagined  it is translated into almost every language  and the cultural barrier argument is dismal and faint  We are all humans and are all in need to peruse this sage advice  Knowledge is not enough  We must have the people skills  of which I must work hard on for it is my weakest link  to empower others and to fulfill our dreams   This was amazing  Sometimes people can be so easy to read it hurts  The overall idea is that you have to be kind to people if you want them to do something  and therefore that will make them want to do it  Not shouting  not giving orders  not imposing yourself  because that makes them feel inferior and hurts their pride  and thus not do whatever you wanted them to do  Also  be interested in them  Fake flattering won t get you anywhere  Listen to what they have to say and you ll be surprised All in all  a great book  Excellent book filled with practical advice  Carnegie s enthusiasm is contagious and radiates off each printed page  Changed the way I interact with people on an everyday basis  The techniques Carnegie discusses are fantastic  they work like magic  Very valuable for written communication especially  I picked this up because my book club is reading it  I don t know if I ever would have otherwise and that would have been unfortunate  There is so much information in this book  I bought it so I can reference it again and again  And  it is life changing  I started applying some of the principles in this book at my job and saw an instant difference  especially in how I felt at the end of the day  Well worth it  I recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their relationships with other people  Wow   I remember reading this years ago after hearing about it over and over again and seeing it in the offices of many local leaders  even my bank teller had it on display   As I was just looking through my collection of books in my library I realized that I was so empowered by this book and it s something you should truly read monthly  as recommended in the book itself  As mentioned on theguardian com  Carnegie taught very simple rules of interaction  such as try to use someone s name when talking to them or first meeting them  Listen to what they have to say and let other people do a lot of the talking when discussing your ideas  Be enthusiastic and never let an opportunity to make a new friend pass by as you never know when you might need them  That s the gist of this book and it s such common sense you almost feel like you already knew it all along but needed some guidance to refresh your memory  This is your refresher    This book should be required reading begining at age 12 and must be re read every 5 years for life  it has been of great help and has changed my way of thinking in how to deal with people   the principles in the book are genuine   universal truths that we overlook in our daily lives   thoroughly enjoyable with so many short anecdotes that the book is definitely  unputdownable    5 5 and two thumbs up A classic I wish I read a long time ago  If more people took this stuff to heart the world would probably be a better place  And if politicians and foreign policy advisors adopted   adapted these approaches the world would definitely be a better place  This book is like the Mona Lisa of self development   It s faccinating   This is among the most useful books I ve read  Dale Carnegie offers his insights in dealing with other people in the most human ways and allowing for a mutual benefit in turn  As Carnegie  disappointingly  points out on several occasions  this is the sort of stuff they should us in school  and even since 1936  our education system lacks this important knowledge   Carnegie writes well and much of the book is filled with actual stories of his principles put into practice  I highly recommend this read to everyone  and especially so to geeks  as they d benefit greatly from the skills presented in this book  the book was really good in the sense that you can immediately start implementing the things the author mentions  It is very realistic and down to earth  not too confusing or too difficult to try and do  I also loved how the examples were of normal people and the author went the extra mile to give more than one example on each item to insure you understand the different approaches I started using the suggestions almost as and when I heard them because they left a quick effect and are fairly easy to do as long you remember to do them for anyone who works with clients customers or is in Marketing Communications or even if you want to develop your people skill  this is a brilliant book   This book was better than I remembered it being from the time I read it decades ago  Great book which helps me to improve my communication skill   I ve resisted reading this because it sounded manipulative  fake  Having read the book now  I think we d enjoy a far better society if we all followed these rules  Highly recommended read  I love Dale Carnegie books and i m a sucker for self improvement books because they always make me feel like i can do anything  Plus    i ve won many a friend and influenced hoards of people due to this book  Just sayin  The reading of this book helped me to know how to tackle situations and be intrested amoung people  I have read this book several times  It is one that is based on basic principles that we often forget  Highly recommend it be read by anyone who interact with others   so yes that would be everyone  Excellent ideas   Zn bn hdh lktb hw  wl ktb qry th mn lHswb  dyl krnyjy trk fyW  thran Tyban wHsWn mn Trq  t mly m  khryn    l ymknny  n  tjhl hdh lktb  ndm yTlb mny ktb jyd  n lt ml m

read over and over  reading for the third time   a must   This is a MUST read  This timeless classic will help anyone in all areas of life  This book takes information and interviews form thousands of successful people and compiles it into a format that makes tremendous commen sense  The narrative is plain spoken and folksy  Truely a timeless self help book   There are many milestone comments in this book which changed my thinking  Changing my thinking changed my world both inside and how I related to people around me  It wasn t easy to set aside past behaviours and attitudes I had learned but it was worth digging it up and throwing it away and starting afresh  That God didn t judge people until the end of their days so what right did I have to criticise made me cry my eyes out for an hour and then the real work of change began  The blessing from that cannot be quantifiable  This book MUST to read   This is one of those books to study and reread and reread  Tons of wisdom      This was the most influential self help book I ve read and it always kept me interested with the anecdotes  My two oldest  ages 11 and 10  read this  I never have  and they ve been calling me on not acting by its ideals  Time to pick it up  Carnegie s book  How to Win Friends and Influence People should be read in one s teens as I did and have been a great admirer of Carnegie since then  It has played a very significant role in my personal development  teaching me two very important lessons how to empathize with others and secondly  keeping the business relationships and personal relationship absolutely inseparable  Every time I read this book  I have read it between 20 30 times  I find that I tend to treat people a little better every time  I have it both in audio and in written  I strongly recommend it  Masterpiece  i don t have words to explain but i think i should ve read this years ago    classic  everyone should know and practice these basic principles of human interaction So  I finally ended reading this book  For me this book was one of a kind  I read about one article on warren buffet in local business newspaper one day  In which he mentioned how this book has been a great influence on him and how he lauded the author s work  Then that s it  I made up a mind to grab this book and make sure I too read this book  and here I did  This is very few of my non fiction reads till now  Let me put it this way  I may not be a perfect reviewer of this book  because of my negligible knowledge of reviewing or at least particular in non fiction area  but I can least say how satisfied I was after reading this book  Nevertheless  it s added to one of my favorites for my life  As it is mentioned in the book by author  this book is not supposed to be read like a novel  but more of like a life help book which you can refer to or re read it as many times as you can and try to imbibe the principles stated in the book This is what I m planning to do  to re read it very soon again  It s a must haves for all the novice pro readers  as I think this book would help you in some way or the other  I don t think its any genre specific or anything rather its more of general human specific  Which is why I think this book needs this very attention  I shall not speak much about this book  I think it s a quite a quick read and definitely worth a time  Go and grab this book when you can  its definitely a worth the money at which it sells Am actually looking forward to read more books by this author   Everything valuable in Psychology is in this book for making your life better  The ideas are also in the Bible   The very first book I read with my Mom    I was 7 how lucky was I to have such a progressive thinkers as she  This book teaches you fundamental techniques in dealing with people  how to make people like you  how to win people to your way of thinking  and how to be a leader  I enjoyed reading this book very much and thought it was very well written  It consists of several short stories which makes it easy to read without getting bored  I liked how Dale Carnegie utilized his broad spectrum of knowledge in history to thoroughly explain skills he s obtained over his lifetime to truly be a better person  My favorite thing about this book is how you can read it in any order you want  unlike an ordinary book  I don t usually enjoy reading but I was able to easily give this book a five star rating   A self help worth readingWho am I to review this old yet still new book  a classic easy to read book full with gems of wisdom that never goes out of style  this is a very useful book though its a bit old the applications available for the methods given will be out there until human communication remains   One usually hears the title of this book in conjunction with a joke about someone   but it shouldn t be a joke  Not only is it a book everyone should read  I think everyone should read it once a year as a review   I loved this book  Great advice for anyone  Some people probably see this advice as all  duh   and while it is common sense  it is presented in such a logical manner that it still feels like you re learning  I think this is the best management book I ve read  Plus  the writing and examples are so adorably old timey  I ve thought more about listening since reading this book    wl ktb qr th tqrybkn lh  thr ry   fy nfsy    t lmt mnh  dwt bsyT  wlknh f l  w mw thr  fy ksb mn Hwly It s a very useful book  Simple principles  It s easy to read but not so easy to apply those principles to everyday life  Practice is very important to make the best use of the book  Because it was written quite a while ago  certain rules in the book are kind of outdated   I loved this book  Easy to read  with great anecdotal stories to support each chapter s principle  A must read for anyone in a sales and marketing position  I listened to an abridged summarized version of this book based on a recommendation  and found it very insightful and helpful  I probably wouldn t follow every advice in it in that exact way  but it is definitely worthwhile to check out  While a lot of the ideas weren t new to me  I found that it is written with great examples and anecdotes to make the concepts more demonstrative and relatable  as well as interesting  I am going to get the full copy in the future  as well as read Carnegie s other books  and do recommend this one to others   What an AWESOME book     I loved it  It makes so much sense  He teaches the reader so many ways to be a more thoughtful  caring  humble  sincere  selfless and an all around GOOD person  If everyone read this book we d all change the world for the better   D If you never read Dale Carnegie s best selling book  How To Win Friends and Influence People  1938    then it s likely you haven t got many friends  and have a laughable amount of influence over people The author  Dale Carnegie used to give lectures on how to become a more likeable boss in the workplace  and increase staff productivity as a result  It was when he realised that these tactics were extremely effective at getting anybody to like you  that he decided to write the book  It was first published in 1936 and has since sold over 15 000 000 copies worldwide  it is also widely considered to be the world s first self help book How to Win Friends and Influence People might be a funny name for a book  but it is undoubtedly the tome for helping one develop better relationships with anyone  whether it be at work  on the bus  or at home  Highly recommended   In my opinion  this books presents the most important principles mankind can learn  It doesn t only help you in entrepreneurship or sales  it is this high level way of living that we all must accept as mandatory  This book  also applying its rules   is all that it takes to make the world a better place  My sincere appreciation  This goes on the greatest book in my list as  Intelligent Investor  does  This book is simply a masterpiece  Its usefulness extends not only to those who have to move with a number of persons on a daily basis  but also to individuals mostly left to themselves  This is so because the author prepares the reader to be a good human being at peace with himself or herself   This book changed my life for the better  This is a gem of a book  Whenever an author tries to blindly advocate some philosophy as a universal truth  especially in personality development books  I tend to repel from it and apparently can t trust his doctrine  This is one guy who probably did more research than any other human being for writing a book with this theme  He also demonstrates it  He himself mentioned to use this book as a dictionary which should be revisited several times  After reading once  I agree that the book stands upto this statement  Even though the book was dated  the information was timeless  Easy to implement in daily living  Such a great and entertaining read  Plus it should be a required read in school since some people are so socially handicapped and dumb  This book is a must read for anyone wanting to do better in any business or personal endeavor   ktb ry   ymknn  n njd

old and dull  you can call it  common sense  everybody already know it  type of book  but admit it  Carnegie tells the truth  Many people never aware the importance of traits that this book taught you to do  and Carnegie explains it with a straightforward examples that will make you feel guilty about yourself  Why this old book still relevant today  Because human s nature is never changed  Definitely a timeless masterpiece  I took a course one Saturday just on this book  I was 19 at the time  and I have never  ever regretted having this information under my belt If you are shy about talking socially  this book has all the answers  I still remember the order housefamilychimneyplaneJust those four will be enough conversation for at least an hour   As one with a more scientific mind  this book helped me to better interact with people  I ve read it several times  and it has changed the way I interact with others for the better Some highlights   Those who have technical skill  plus the ability to  EXPRESS IDEAS     AROUSE ENTHUSIASM IN OTHERS   are those who are headed for higher earning power  not those who can simply outperform everyone on a technical level    When presenting an alternative point of view  lessen the pride wall by admitting  I could be wrong   If you admit you could be wrong  they re likely to as well  Avoid correcting people in public  especially over trivial things  You may be right  but it could cause you to lose a friend   Speak to other s interests  When trying to sell them on something  remember that people don t really much care about your interests at all  How is what you are selling going to benefit them   Never forget the futility of criticism  never say anything critical of anyone  at anytime  The person in whom your confiding when blaming others is also a  one    why wouldn t you do the same behind their back  It destroys trust  Stands the test of time  Still completely relevant  Great  practical advice on how to talk to people that you interact with daily while making lasting impressions on their perspective of you  I learned a lot from this book and believe that if you try to apply the principles to your life  you will be very successful in all your relationships  Great communication tips   It helps    That s all I can tell you  IT REALLY DOES HELP    Written in 1936  this book ranks up there with Think And Grow Rich as one of the best books of all time   A MUST read   77 years later   and still great If you love self improvement  love people  and want to figure out how to get along in the world  then read this book  incredible book and what more incredible is  the forgotten basic  Mr  Carnegie will not told you to change them but he clearly mentioned the fact that what we need to change in ourselves to see the change in themselves I have not even a slightest doubt that if I can follow these principles even a bit of them the story will be different but here comes the most challenging task    to religiously follow them Awesome read A great reminder on the power of personal leadership   Great read  Very good and simple advice  Told with interesting stories that keep the book moving along  If you only have a little time  each chapter could probably be read independent of the rest of the book  I think I may actually start reading one chapter at a time here and there to give a little food for thought for the day  I read this three times before graduating high school in 1991  I make it a practice to read it again  once a year and on a couple occasions  even twice in a given year  One of the best  and most common sense  books of all time I think this should be REQUIRED reading at least by the Sophomore or Junior year of High School  Even if it was pushed back to the Senior year  it should by ALL means  be a part of graduation requirements  Some people may think this is a book about kissing up to people and playing games of manipulation to get what is desired out of people  This couldn t be farther from the truth  This is a book about human nature  It teaches you to communicate in a way that will give people what they want out of interactions with you and in turn you will get what you desire out of them  Everyone should read this book   I read this nearly 15 years ago and it helped me turn from shy introvert to an extrovert  I m still using some of the tips I learnt back in those days  Good interpersonal relations book  This book is an essential read  Everybody should follow these simple steps and watch their world transform  Amazing book that stands the test of time  Amazing book  read the English version   I keep reading it over and over again This book should be required reading for every human being  The world would be a different place    Great book for any business leader  I ve read it twice and parts of it three times  We should really ask ourselves why books like these do not make their way into our schools   A must read on human relations  One of the most influential books in my life  Taught me how to properly deal with people in life  In a good way  How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie is a classic  That is all there needs to be said  It is a book that you can read  make notes in  and pick up every year  It has had a powerful influence on the way we think about other people  and ourselves  It was way ahead of its time in 1953  and is still topical more than a half century later  A must read for anyone interested in making new friends  acquiring new clients and customers  improve your conversation skills  and to win people over to your way of thinking  Brilliant in simplicity  it is the groundwork for self improvement The book begins like no other  Carnegie encourages readers to make notes  to jot down in the book and read every chapter at least twice  By actively engaging in a book  you will be most involved  and will remember more  Even before the book engages you to think about personal interactions  you have learned a valuable lesson applicable in all your further reads  The learning continues with chapters on topics like 1  How to interest people  2  How to get cooperation  and 3  No one likes to take orders  One of the basic techniques featured in the book is to put yourself in someone else s shoes  This is in total alignment with the fifth principle of leadership by Stephen R  Covey  Seek First to Understand  Then to be Understood  You can t win an argument  is the clever title of the first chapter in the section about getting people to your way of thinking  After giving a lively example  Carnegie explains what is wrong with arguments  He states that nine out of ten times people will be more opposite to each other than before the argument commenced  Even when you win  it will be an empty victory  because you will not get the opponents good will  The chapter concludes with nine tips on how to prevent a disagreement from becoming an argument  In less than ten pages  a very important aspect of daily interaction has been explained  without jargon or unmanageable ways  but with simple language and clear examples and tips Dale Carnegie grew up as a poor boy without any special skills  He learned all the skills written in the book along the way of life  He shows that you can change yourself over the years  He was a firm believer that only 15  of your  financial  success depends on your professional skills  and that 85  is based on interpersonal skills  described as  the ability to express ideas  to assume leadership  and to arouse enthusiasm among people  To date 16 million people have been influenced by the book  Among them is Warren Buffet  he followed the course related to the book  by Dale Carnegie himself  and to this day has the diploma in his office How to Win Friends and Influence People is a straightforward  no nonsense  go and do it book  It has been a life changer for many people  including the author of this review  Although it does not give much advice about how to implement the techniques  not much is actually needed  Without a doubt the book deserves a 6 out of 6 rating  the best book i ve ever read  now it s a matter of practicing what i learned  good insight  This book  although this was the second time I read it  opened my eyes to such simple ways to be kinder and an overall pleasant person  Now I must start putting these tips into practice so I can make more friends  I love this book  It s absolutely powerful and the principals are incredible when genuinely applied  Great book  It teaches and change my philosophy way of thinking about communicating  Though  first time reading might have a hard time understanding  I read the revised edition   Try to digest it one chapter at a time and you ll get the hang of what he s telling you there I think that everyone should read this at least once  Excellent book   amazing that even so long after its initial publication it can still be so relevant to human nature  Lots to think about  This is quite possibly one of the most important books ever written  Dale Carnegie s insights into dealing with people are timeless and effective  While some of the concepts seem too easy to work  when actually applied  they truly do win people to your way of thinking I had a meeting recently with my boss  and walked away confused because he was very defensive the entire conversation  In our next meeting  instead of going to him with reasons that I was right  I decided to test out one of Carnegie s principles  I went into the meeting and gave him an honest complement on how his hard work and skills are very hard to match  If the organization had more men like him  it would be filled with heroes    so  how did he respond  We had one of the most pleasant and effective meetings that we had ever had Thanks Dale Carnegie  Don t let the fact that this book was first published in 1936 make you think that it is at all out of date or not applicable in todays brave new world  Getting along with people is one of those skills that no one teaches you  but every one of us would agree there is a wrong way  and a better way  I picked this up because I knew I was lacking in my ability to work with and influence others  I know someone who read this book while young and it was a life changing experience for them  To me  this person embodies many of the principles contained in this book  The book has been updated through the years but still retains the style and phrasing it did when first written  Many of the stories and examples from the original book are retained  This can make it come across as overly simplistic  and undocumented in todays world where the sum total of human knowledge is a click or two away  Speaking personally though  I quite fell in love with this book  It has the element of wisdom pasted down from the elder generation to the younger generation  I highly recommend it  THE BOOK THAT CHANGED MY LIFE FOR EVER  SENT BY GOD Facil entendimento e de otimos resultados  This book great for many pepople and special for young   One of the best book you ll ever find on people   Everyone should read this book  It is quite possibly the best  how to  on people interaction that I have read  Not all  but some advice could be successfully applied in real life in post soviet country    well worth reading and applying I cannot even begin to tell you how monumentally true and practical it s message is    This is a relationship book of biblical proportions  Which is why it was such a challenging read  taking me two courageous years to press through and finish  Everyone should read this book  Literally  The world would be a much better place  Timeless  research based advice on how to be a classy  decent human being  in both your personal and business interactions  All based on the understanding that what you put out is what comes back at you  A lot of this is common sense  and a lot of it is what we already know  i e   follow the Golden Rule  but it is a very well written  well organized  concise  invaluable compilation of these things and more  Great examples from history of these principles in action  via Lincoln  Roosevelt  Charles Schwab  etc    Also some surprisingly good parenting advice  I think  unfortunately  some people misinterpret the advice in this book and think it is advocating manipulation and flattery  Carnegie is very clear that it is always imperative to be genuine  But it is beneficial to everyone to try to see things from other viewpoints  use tact  and look for and emphasize the positive when you can   Finally read this classic  Why did it take me so long   You simply must read this book  Some of the stories are a bit dated  but it doesn t make them any less appropriate  Get a paper copy and take notes   This book should be taught in school  No joke   One of the best books I ve ever read   Since I was about 15 years  I was advised to rad this book but never made any attempt to until I was 23 years  It was defintely worth it  I used to think  I have friends already I don t need anymore etc  Trust me  if that is your approach when considering whether to read this book or not  don t let that pre conceived notion I had defer you from reading Mr  Carnegie indicated ways of dealing with people  for eg  the simple task of smiling with someone you pass by  remembering someone s name  the latter principle i have strongly adopted because i take a lot of pride in my name  I like when people remembers my name I read this book when I finished law school and began my working career  and it has helped      Strongly recommend it  would read it all over again   really good advice Timeless instructions on being a charismatic and influential person  I recommend this book to everyone   Very good book about human relations   not much for entertainment but hopefully it will help me at work and home  should be on everyone s reading list I read this book around the age of 14 15  Without exaggeration  it transformed the way I saw and interacted with the world  Hokey sounding  maybe  but for a struggling teenager it changed the direction of my life  Best book to read when you re taking psychology A must read for everyone  Great book  I would re read this book every year of my life  The name sounds just awful  but actually this is a wonderful book    the main message is  the way you win friends and influence people is you show them you genuinely care  Really good little ideas on how you can do this in your every day life  The most powerful book I ve ever read Honest to god  I was NOT a very likable person growing up  I had maybe 2 friends  No girlfriends  got in fights every year  Never got along with anyone  I read this book and it changed me for the better Every where I go now  I can make friends with anyone  This book has helped me become a better salesman as well for my job At the same time  this book can be used for evil  I ve used this book in seduction and it has increased my dates tremendously  I can get someone who s incredibly mad at me for anything  to forgive me within minutes  I can use these techniques to con people  play them and get what I want  Very  very powerful book  One that I will continue to read over and over again But enough talking me  my life isn t nearly as interesting as yours  Tell me more about yours   Pasted from Lenz Blog  published there on October 10  2011This book has its own shiny Wikipedia entry  Authored by Dale Carnegie and first published in 1936  it has sold over 15 million copies since My interest for the last half year in writing this blog is in advocacy related to global warming  If I am bothering at all  I prefer to get the most impact for my efforts   Influencing people  is therefore an interesting topic I have just finished writing every word of that book in a file on my personal computer  Copyright for the book has expired in Japan  but this is privileged use anyway  since I am not giving anyone any copies but am just doing that as a method to read the book attentively  which is privileged under Article 30 of the Japanese copyright law as  personal use  I think that many of the suggestions in this book make sense  and am looking forward to applying some of them I even found some mistakes in the process  After all these years  page 76 cites  Shakespear  and on page 101 there is the sentence  You want to approval of those with whom you come in contact   Re read  or rather re listened to  this  as I promised myself I was going to do when I got it last year  I really think the title is misleading  It should be something like  How to Have Healthier  Happier and More Positive Relationships with People  This time I actually got to put some of the principles of this book into practice when tutoring an unwilling 7th grader  Receiving D s and F s and reading at 3rd grade level   M  is not unintelligent  She is just one  of the many  child ren  pushed through the system ready or not Anyway  when M failed to respond to my charming personality  I realized that I needed to find what interested and motivated her  Ever since  we have been gradually building a relationship based on who she is  what she wants  and how I can help her  Admittedly I started at a very low level  candy for good performance   but it got her attention and we are slowly making progress  little by little each week  Anyway  she at least talks to me now and doesn t hide behind her long hair anymore  This last week I challenged her to show me her first test or quiz  in any class  above 80  and promised an unspecified reward Thank you Mr  Carnegie             Recently a good friend and colleague told me how much this book helped her and I remembered how much I enjoyed it when I first read it  years ago   As I could hardly remember any specifics from that distant time  only the overall favorable impression  I learned a great deal from this reread  The author and my friend both recommend returning to the principles of this book at least once   year  Based on my own desire to have happy and positive human relations I agree this is a worthwhile book  I hope to make reading listening to it something I do every January  We all need to get along and this book is chock full of helpful ideas for improving all of our relations with others  It isn t about using other people to get what we want  except insofar as we learn how to achieve happy  loving relationship s   mutual respect and peaceful homes workplaces Highly recommended   How to be

  The writer did not get it wrong when he chose the title  How to      an amazing timeless book you can read to help you in your everyday life  No matter what your profession is  you will find that the principles described by the author apply to any situation you find yourself in  I read this book a long time ago and I still remember the satisfaction I experienced on each page I was devouring  easy to read  with very realistic examples and full of simple techniques  this book should be made mandatory when you are at highschool  I m not joking  it is exactly at that time that we re forming our personality  by reading such an amazing book  we will have more chance to react to situations in a most intelligent way and grasp the opportunities that are always there The funny thing is  although I read it at highschool  I still seem to remember some of the techniques as if I had read it recently  I am not sure  though  if I am applying them correctly  you might ask my friends     Brilliant book  A real inspiration  Must have rules with great examples  excellent book I really love the advice he gave in this book  and especially appreciated all the examples listed from history and his personal experience  I think it is especially important that he emphasized being genuine and sincere because I can see how the book s advice could also be applied in a fake and bad manner  I plan on trying to remind myself and incorporate many of these tips in my interactions for people  E sicuramente un libro molto utile per imparare a relazionarsi con gli altri anche nella vita di tutti giorni    Qualcuno affermo   la gentilezza e rivoluzionaria   questo libro ne e la conferma Sebbene ricco di aneddoti e fatti storici si legge molto facilmente  Consigliato   If you read only one self help book  this one is not a bad choice  the context of the system that we reside in makes perfect sense 5 senses very much manipulative and requires primal intent a code a certain order of things the crux of the system that maintain internal punishment for the lower class Highton approval for the upper class and navigation for all in between in a generational form of flux Cannot recommend this book highly enough  Amazing book  If you have a pre teen or teenage girl  a must read for you and them  Excellent book on the habits one might cultivate to be nice  Contrary to what the title may suggest  what you really do is earn people s admiration and trust by taking an interest in people  giving credit to others  and smiling  But don t let my description dissuade you from reading it   mhm fy Hytn lywmy  wnHtj ltTbyq mwrd fyh This is one of those life changing books that everyone should read  but you hope no one will   Great book if you have to work with people  lead people  be lead by people or you are in sales    Teaches alot about the art of dealing with people in diplomatic fashion   A classic with basic interpersonal skills An excellent book that is surprisingly readable for a book first penned in 1936    and just as applicable today as it was then  This is definitely one to read again periodically    Yes  much of it is common sense today  but it is definitely worth a read through  if only for the inspiring anecdotes on historical figures like Lincoln  Charles Schwab  and others  Carnegie handily breaks the book down into several sections on social interaction with a handful of principles in each  Fundamental Techniques in Handling People Don t criticize  condemn  or complain Give honest and sincere appreciation Arouse in the other person an eager wantSix Ways to Make People Like You Become genuinely interested in other people Smile Remember that a person s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language Be a good listener  Encourage others to talk about themselves   Talk in terms of the other person s interests Make the other person feel important and do it sincerelyWin People to Your Way of Thinking The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it Show respect for the other person s opinions  Never say   You re wrong  If you are wrong  admit it quickly and emphatically Begin in a friendly way Get the other person saying  yes  yes  immediately Let the other person do a great deal of the talking Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers Try honestly to see things from the other person s point of view    Be sympathetic with the other person s ideas and desires Appeal to the nobler motives Dramatize your ideas Throw down a challengeBe a Leader Begin with praise and honest appreciation Call attention to people s mistakes indirectly Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person Ask questions instead of giving direct orders Let the other person save face Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement  Be  hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise   Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to Use encouragement  Make the fault seem easy to correct Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest   If I could summarize the book down into one principle  it would be this    Yes  it is the golden rule  and fairly obvious  but it is something that many  including me  often fail to consider before speaking  Great read though    and surprising  I went into it thinking it was a classic I should read  but not expecting to be such an easy  fluid read    This is one I suspect I will read many times throughout my life  and I d love to hand it down to my children    First influential based book that I read  Being in sales  being a father  and being a community member this book provides a basis for allowing you to see how to best utilize your time and hone your skills for more success  Daily  we interact with other human beings  and this book helps you focus on how to be an effective communicator   I think this book should be on everyone s reading lists  Although it is old and Dale Carnegie sounds quite presumptuous throughout the entire book  his main message is one I think people should adopt as their own  Through many personal examples and stories  he sends the same message for what he calls the  secret to success   I wouldn t say this is the only quality you need  but it is an important one to take to heart  I really like this book   thanks Amanda  One of the best if not THE best  self development book i love the sarcastic style of carnegie and it still works even after years and yearsbut still the right deal when it comes to dealing with people  It s a MUST READ book in life time  There is a tide in the affairs of man  which taken at the flood leads on to fortune  etc  etc I know what you are thinking  You re thinking  hey  that sounds good  That Shakespeare  for obviously the words are his   I reckon he was really on to something there  It would be a good topic for a self help book in fact  I would have chapters called   locating your inner beach    swimming to connect  and  mastering the management wave  or some such like  The book could be called  Flood AquaticKing   the seven principles of tide management theory for the fish generation   Alright  alright  I ll admit it  I can t bear self help books  Mostly they are patronising and rather disingenuous entreaties that you can have anything if you just stop being shy and try a bit harder  A plethora of TV talent shows have grown like topsy and thrived on this mantra  that its not talent that matters  its effort and yearning that really counts  There is however one honourable exception  the original grandaddy of all self help books  Dale Carnegie s  How to Win Friends   Influence People  It may not be the best written book in the world  It has a folksy  down at home style and it s pretty repetitive in places  but at heart it contains real insight into human nature and what makes people tick  I ve seen some claims that the book is only really relevant to sales people and that the application of the principles of the book beyond the sales arena is a little creepy and liable to make you cringe  That s unfair and to maintain as much is to focus too narrowly and too literally on the case studies the book contains by way of illustration of its central tenets  Viewed properly  the book offers the sort of guidance that is just not taught in the classroom amongst the Physics and the History and the Maths  It lucidly explains that most valuable of skills  how to deal with people  and to my mind  it ought to be compulsory reading for every teenage school leaver  Make someone smile today An excellent read  Essential fundamentals to recognize when interacting with others  I feel as though this book should be read once a year to refresh one s memory if anyone wishes to better their communication with other people  English level for ESL     The course will blow you away    Hughesitorloseit com  As good as I expected  The information is priceless and it is put across in an easy to understand way  It s clear to see why it has stood the test of time   A great book  essentially a practical application of the Golden Rule  good book wish I ha a paper copy very relavent Amazing book for every day life situations Very good book  Excellent readNothing really out of the ordinary  Just a review of important principles to use and lots of stories  Excellent reminder that kindness trumps motivating by force or fear  This is one of the few books I have ever read that I have kept with the intention of reading it again  A must for sales professionals  management  human service professionals  and anyone who encounters people in their work or outside life  Dale Carnegie uses his unique perspective  dozens of interviews  and research that included hundred of books  manuscripts  and letters to analyze  synthesize  and condense the silver bullet of human relationships into a little less than 300 pages  This book more than delivers what it promises  assuming that the reader follows the principles set forth and one refreshes those principles periodically  Definitely a classic  and definitely a recommended read for almost everyone I know  some need it more than others   Great book  This is the one you will probably go through more than once  Glad I read it  this book shows details that make a difference  and that is extremely applicable and of great importance I always thought this book was about how to be a greedy creep and be rewarded for it  Turns out its full of great advice about how to be a thoughtful  nice person  which comes with its own rewards  Excellent book   One of the most helpful books I ve ever read  I plan to pull it out again every year   This book is a very helpful source for teens such as myself  This book is like a teacher  It has different lessons and advices to know and learn  I learned many things from this book that i ve never thought of that ll work  What this book teaches is how to win friends the right way and how to influence people just like the title says  When I read this title I thought who made this book like I have several friends and I know what the right way to gain friends and I thought that there is no wrong way to win friends  Yes there isn t a wrong way to win friends but this book helps you out how to win friends and or influence people the most professional way   This book was actually a gift from my dad  So I guess I did need another way how to win friends and specially to influence people  The first thing my told me was here read this book you need it  I didn t take it offensively because I already know that my dad sarcasms too much  So I took the challenge and started to read and I thought that it ll be a good idea to be my outside reading and share what I think about this book  Some things about this book that caught my attention was that it was a person talking to me directly and talking teen language  Also how i understood what it was trying to say because in other books that i ve read i had to read over twice or thrice to understand it  In my opinion this book does actually change people s way of thinking  Me myself I did change they way of thinking and learned that the bad things I ve done that makes me look like a bad person  Overall this book is a vry helpful and teachful book to read for teen girls   This is one of those rare books that deserves an honest 11 10 rating  Superb  classy and very easily read A compilation of simple yet effective lessons  which if carried out will propel you into the forefront of people handlers  Although it is a book of lessons  it is written in such an accessible and enjoyable style  that you can t help but want to continue reading it Truly a book to be read  reread and then reread once again to enhance your life in every way possible  through bettering the way you deal with others  This book is great if you want to improve communication skills  It is made up of  principals  to follow when communicating with others  Here are some of the principals I got the most out of Principle No 1  Don t Criticize  Condemn or ComplainYou should try to understand that people may not necessarily be wrong and it could actually be you who s wrong  Try to see another persons  point of view by trying to understand why that person acts this way  This exercise alone can give you a significant understanding of another person  Not many people can see both their and others  points of view Principle no 3  Remember the names of the people you meetWow  This is a big one for me and it is sooooo hard but soooooo important in the business world  It can be an extremely powerful tool because someone s name is personal and if you remember people s names  they normally think positive things about you  According to the author  here is an unconscious process going on in the minds of the people whom you call by their first names when you ve just met them Principle no 6  Say something nice to a personDuh  but hardly anyone does it   I was always too snobby to read this book  so I m grateful that someone turned me around   recommended it to me  These are the basics of social grace and so there isn t any revelatory information  but this book shines because of clear  timeless examples from sources like Abraham Lincoln   Ben Franklin  Its principles are things everyone should know  but may somehow have failed to learn if they ve spent too much time living within themselves instead of paying attention to other people   Read it before getting a highly competitive sales job position that s based on full commission  Carnegie explains human social strategies in through examples  Life is all about relationships  This book really helps you see things from the others point of view and helps you both get what you want  The keys is this book are so simple and easy and yet few people actually apply them in life  It has helped me have more confidence with my interactions with people and I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to strengthen their people skills   bd t qrth fy lthnwy  wmzlt   wd lyh  Great read  I suggest teenagers read this book  it will help them deal with people from their teenage years and beyond  I would highly recommend this to anyone   masterpiece     After reading this book and using it s advice I was happiest I d ever been in my life save travelling   The most influencing book ever i red    Fantastic book  A classic  The ultimate guide on getting along with folks  And the best part  although it is NOT pointed out in the text  is that these are sound principles that can be backed up with God s Word  Love the analogies and stories  Make perfect sense  Some were just repeating though or rather similar I love the Lincoln references  Some times it helps to just read about the effective habits of dealing with people to make you be more introspective of your actions Carnegie s clear writing style and storytelling ability makes this an easy and delightful read  My 1st time reading the book is probably when I was in grade 5  It was the translated version  called  Dac Nhan Tam   I was too young to understand what the book was really about then  but I was very into the stories that Carnegie told  One of the stories I have always remembered is where the author saw a group of children start a fire in the forest  How he dealt with the children to persuade them to be more careful next time  in a very polite and persuasive but gentle manner  has left a strong impression in me till now I don t remember the 2nd or 3rd or 4th    time reading the book  I just remember when I was in grade 11 or 12 I found an article saying 7 Habits of Stephen Covey is the genuine self improvement guidance while How to Win Friends is a manual which only create fake personalities  I stopped thinking about reading this book again  When I went to Goodreads  I rated it 3  based on the last feeling I remembered about the book This year 2015  for several reasons I decided to pick up this book again  I wanted to see how I perceive the book after a very long time not reading it and compare it to 7 Habits  which I d reread before  And the book didn t fail me  I ve come to understand it in a whole new light  While 7 Habits is kind of a systematic approach  How to Win Friends is more intuitive  7 Habits and How to Win Friends don t conflict with each other at all  but they are perfect companions for each other    In this book  Dale Carnegie explains the importance of being friendly to all  It gives many examples of people in the real world who have influenced others by being kind and genuinely interested in them  He informs the reader that someones name is the most important word in any given language  Using the name shows that this person means a lot to you  No movie made from book  I would recommend this book to readers of all ages  This book teaches the reader about life  The author has amazing values that he is sharing with you  He gives you guidance to become successful in anything you wish to achieve  Really enjoyed this classic  Principles to live by and Carnegie provides several great examples   Amazing Book  Thanks to my Father for gifting me one to read    A great book  This is a book I will revisit annually  Amazing  amazing  will read many more times  Great book to apply to your business and personal life  If only we were all so understanding of the human interaction   This book should be your personal  bible  to maintaining friendships and networking  maybe not really a five star book  I found it amazingly good and think this should be mandatory reading in high schools   colleges  The book ends abruptly but that s perhaps for the best  This is a great book  It teaches principles that are very important to anyone that wants to gain more influence amongst people  Some of the principles that I found to be very down to earth and common sense are  be loyal to the absent  I find that a lot of people do not realize how much gossip is so detrimental to reputation  Once we realize and prevent it at all costs we will find our selves much more likeable  That is just to name one important principle found within the book  It is a great read indeed  I think this really is a great book on the qualities a leader should have  Often we think of people as objects to be manipulated and not human beings  This is one of those books that can be referred back to over and over again  It s a great manual and continues to be relevant for every generation  I don t have much to say about this book  Because everything has been already said  I cannot say I have finished this book  I will re read it again  I knew everything what has been said in this book  But I didn t realize this  The book has really changed my approach to people and all the thoughts in the books are still haunting me  I was really lucky that I was able to read the book  Thanks Dale for giving us this gift  I read this book every 4 6 months  I need to be reminded of the points he make and stories to support them  You cannot just read the book get inspired for two weeks and forget about it later  You need to read and do it until they turn to habit  This book makes you be a blessing to life of others and that kids is how you win your friends     Great book  I first picked it up at the library at 12 years old and read it again in college  many years later   Ignore the cheesy title  This is one of the best books on human relationships and the way of life I ve read so far   In fairness I have this book on Audio tape  love it and listen to it on many a long drive  It gives great advice and is quite an effective aid in improving ones dealings with people  This book is important  Sure  it s got a goofy old title  And it was written a long time ago  But this book literally tells you how to be a good person There are so few things you can do in life that are truly meaningful  and one of those is being a good person  Like a real  honest  good person  This book talks about how to do that  Kill them with kindness  is the overarching theme of this book in my opinion  and it s a good one  Whether with family  friends  or business  I think Carnegie s ideas can solve a lot of problems  As an independent software developer  I get a few emails from people occasionally upset about something that isn t working quite right  They re used to dealing with some faceless  giant software corporation  so they don t know there s just one guy from the Midwest United States behind that email address  reading each one of their emails carefully  So whenever I get an email that might be a big on the inflammatory side  I just take a lesson from this book and be a good person  It s amazing what a positive attitude  gratefulness  sympathy and forgiveness can do I ll be reading this one a few more times I think  Highly recommend  And I won t complain if someone changes this book s title  Easy to follow advices with real world examples  A perfect recipe for a training manual Timeless  practical book on understanding human nature  Good story telling to illustrate points  Highly recommend  If more people read this book  the world would be a different place   Book of my parents   I read this when I was still a teen   one of the biggest influences in my life  So far this is a page turner and an excellent self help book if your feeling like you just arent getting along in the workplace with ppl or even in life this book is helpful   To this day  I reference this book in any leadership classes I take in order to enhance their understanding of people skills and cement my own people skills  This book teachers you the best ways of working with people and knowing the best way to go about all types of social situations  A MUST READ FOR SOCIAL SKILL SURVIVAL  This book is a perennial read  So practical  so accessible  and still so needed in our society  In summary  it s a book about tact  I like it most for it s tips on helping to express interest in people and recognizing how much everyone craves good relationships  While at times the techniques come across as having skin deep sincerity  I feel like sometimes you just need to fake it until you can make it  He talks about sincerity  but for a more  inside out  approach to good relationships  7 Habits   another perennial favorite  is a good complementary read   Excellent  And so much of it is common sense  Apparently  common sense is what so many are lacking these days  read many years ago  i am sure this book must be very dated  at the time I read this I was in my teens  different times  different views Everybody should read this book if you want to be a better person  Reading this should be mandatory  Wonderful book  with great results One of the classic works on human relations  Perhaps the best one ever written  This book has given me confidence  It helped me alot in terms of the way I communicated with my friends  And the rapport that I have built with them  Wow So simple  so obvious but can make you think positively  Maybe in the digital age it s a little bit different but still good piece  I have read it twice and I am just starting it again  It teaches true principles in dealing with people  An incredibly useful book  These strategies are all so great   I ve benefited so much from thinking about them and trying to apply them in my life  Most of the book is filled with examples illustrating the principles suggested  I felt like it was quite repetitive  but this actually ended up being more helpful than annoying  as the repetition engrained the information in my mind  So glad I finally got around to reading this  I found this book simply amazing  I m disappointed that it took me until now to read it  I truly believe this book should be required reading in any universities leadership or management program  Whether you are in business setting or simply want some sound advice on how to handle people  this book is fantastic Dale Carnegie mixes theory with actual examples to keep the reader s interest  Although his writing is decades old  it is as relevant today as ever When I was a new manager  I made so many of the mistakes that Carnegie points out  It has taken time but my personality now matches what he recommends  There is always room for improvement  and Mr Carnegie points that out too  This is an excellent book  It infuses enough humor in the topic to keep the audience engaged  and the tools are very applicable to real world situations   view spoiler  Part 3  Win people to your way

discuss philosophy though  Well ahead of his time  he uses his knowledge  his humor  and countless real life narratives to posit a brillant approach to living  This classic is still useful after all these years  This book was one of those life changers for me  I recommend it to anyone who wants to become a better person  more personable  conscientious  and impacting on people around you  fantastic book everyone should read  couldn t put it down  Nearly 80 years old but still very relevant  thought provoking   motivational  Will read again Must read  While many of the ideas seem obvious  the stories are wonderful  and the writing heatfelt  Everyone should give it a read  some perhaps more than others     Classic  Very good and timeless  Mostly loved this book because its perfect for a social retard like me  I needed every lesson in it  I have it easily accesible and reread it frequently  Maybe one day I l learn  Favorite Quotes   Any fool can criticize  condemn and complain   and most fools do  But it takes character and self control to be understanding and forgiving   Really good book  Basically  How to go beyond respect  I agree with your estimation of Carnegie s masterpiece  The more I manage and try to lead people the more I realize why this was and is such a revolutionary book  So many people struggle with even the simplest of interpersonal interaction and virtually no one is a master of it  This book is a fantastic read for everyone  It s applicable to everyday circumstances at home  community  or work  I would recommend to read it more than once  I found this book to be very insightful  and I expect the concepts it discusses to be vry useful in handling people  I purchased this book 6 years ago and I have read this book many times over  each time the book becomes more meaningful and insightful  It is an amazingly clear book that explains why and how some people are socially suave and how you can become that way too This book is fundamental for any professional seeking to win people over to their thinking  build relationships and networks  and to expand your social circle and social skills It is truly a shame that the skills and knowledge in this book is not taught in our schools today  wonderful  nothing to say more I should have read this book long ago  Considering that its been over 60 years that the author wrote the book its amazed me with its simplicity  In the few pages that I have read  I can already see how I can improve myself leaps and bounds  I have read a couple of other self help books   Seven Habits of highly effective people and 92 way on How talk to anyone but found this much more interesting and intuitive to apply  Hats of to Dale Carnegie    This book is fantastic  I can t recommend it highly enough  Learn how to deal with people  Great read with many examples Concepts are so simple and seem obvious but so hard to follow in real life  I made about 2 pages of notes when reading this  as it is just one of those books where you have to in order to soak in what you are reading At the end of those two pages  I wrote   Concluding  an interesting book and many people do a Carnegie course  Ultimately though  I will continue to be myself in life  but it was interesting to read about how human minds work and how motivation works  Loved it  Everyone should read this  Wonderful reminders and info for all ages  An enticing book  A must read for everyone who wants to improve their hability to get along with people and do better business in general  It also shows an important lesson on decency and good social manners  I m looking forward towards reading the other Dale Carnegie manuals   I m sure they ll be written in the same light heated manner  A must read for everyone  Great people skills book  When I first heard the title of this book  I truly thought it was about manipulating others and persuading them against their will  so I resisted reading it for a very long time  I finally picked it up after having it recommended about 10 times  My initial belief could not have been further from the truth This book is about being friendly  kind  generous  encouraging  tactful  humble and inspiring  It is a must read for any entrepreneur  Actually  it s a must read for every human  I believe people would get along better if they took to heart some of the principles in this book And it was very humorous  with lots of stories and examples making for a very pleasant and easy read  It shows how we should appreciate people and be treat them better Very important lesson I love this book I want to read it over and over agin  Everyone should read this book at least once  Excelent book  a book that everyone should read The best book out there on people skills  This book honestly changed my life  Definitely worth a read  Really a great read  This should be required reading in high school or at minimum college   Timeless  This book is essential reading for any young person  Dale shares his life wisdom in a simple  easy to read manner  I particularly like his wit  Enjoyable  eye opening read   I know 100  of these strategies  But reviewing these is so refreshing  A must read for everybody  Too often and too easily we tend to criticize people  We tend to only think about ourselves  However the key to good relations is to think about other people  This book contains a lot of tips on how to become better with people and make your life easier when it comes to any kind of relationships  Awesome book if you want to add value to yourself   Amazing audiobook  Definitely worth hearing  Structured through different principles with many examples to help you change your mentality   This book requires note taking  and it ll be a major disservice to you if you don t go over those notes at least once every six months  A blue chip standard of relating to people in business and personal life  an awesome book with an amazing inside to how and why we do what we do  It is also really pratical in your eeveryday life  I really recommends it to everybody  especially to business people  A good guide for all aspects of live  personal or professional  This is a  classic  that is worth reading time and time again  The principles discussed are logically sound  but less easy to consistently perform  I especially like the many concrete examples demonstrating the taught principles in action  Thanks to those who recommended it  I now need to get my own copy to reread and mark up  This is one of our family classics  What would Abraham Lincoln Do  Less Me and

that they can be more confident and be close to the success  Besides  we need to think for others  When they have problems  they may be shy to tell you  At that time  if you take the initiative to help  they may feel very warm  Every day we go to school  we should be confident and happy instead of bored and tired  We need to bring a good mind to the school  If we fall in the exam  don t be sad  Never mind  relax  you can be better next time  This book also tells us how to make a good family  I think the first step is the sense of responsibility  We should take care of our family and be honest to every member in the family  Spending more time with your family is also important  That will makes the family more harmonious  I really like this book and it is very useful for me  I love this book and everything it stands for  It really makes you think about how you treat people and cites interesting examples from historical leaders such as Abraham Lincoln and Benjamin Franklin I wish someone would update or re write something this good for dealing with appearance and relationships in the digital age  since social media has changed a lot of how we interact in personal and business relationships   Worthwhile reading this book  author Dale Carnegie  conveyed us how to handle people and make them friends  He explains with examples  that makes us to understand  how to react to the people in positive way in any situation  Some of the principles that we have to follow are Don t criticize  condemn or complain  Give honest and sincere appreciation  Smile  Try honestly to see things from the other person s point of view  Show respect for the other person s opinions  Never say   You re wrong   If you are wrong  admit it quickly and emphatically  If we follow the rules  it will help us to handle any situation and maintains a good relationship with people in our life   Should ve been taught to every single person in school growing up  Love this book  I applied it immediately and results are real   Probably the best book ever written  So much truth in every sentence he wrote  I just love that book and can read it again and again  A great book  Timeless considering when it was written  I expected it to actually bore me  how wrong was I  I found it fascinating yet so so simple  ill definitely need to read it again  I have a social awkwardness and shyness that can cripple me and I feel everyone should pick this book up and give it a chance  Not because of my own reasons but because it teaches us to be nice to people  to want to be nice  not to manipulate or bully  Will pass this on to my daughter when she s old enough to appreciate the words  Timeless treasure  I can t believe this was written in the 30s    definitely a book to share with friends and family  regardless of age   Oh man  I plan on re reading this every few years or so  A few things seem to be out of date with some modern psychology but the vast majority of the techniques all feel super legit and have even been reiterated by more modern books on similar topics  Highly recommended  A book that needs reading many times to keep one self on track  A very good book overall  I love this book and have started rereading it  I tried it as a social experiment  and the affects were immediate and positive  I loved the experience of seeing it in action  i highly recommend reading and applying it to your own life  Still one of my all time favorites  A great book that encourages you to think again about your habits during conversations  For a book published in 1936  it has remained highly relevant today  2013   There has to be something right about the book   you have to see that for yourself One of the oldest Western books in my collection that is principally centred  Each one will have a different lesson to take away  best book ever This is an incredible book  Changed the way I think about conversations with people and has helped me to become a more selfless person when I m in a conversation  Carnegie really puts things into perspective  This isn t a read for a certain type of people  it s a must read for everybody who wants to be a good friend and an approachable person  Another awesome book from Dale Carnegie  Great examples  great principles  Great book  All Dale Carnegie books are outstanding and necessary reading  Simply the best set of self improvement books you will ever find  Its amazing that a book written roughly 75 years ago has so much useful and helpful points that still apply today  While the world has changed quite a bit since Dale Carnegie fisrt wriote this book  how people want to be treated and spoken to hasn t Regardless of your current situation in life  you can learn something valuable from this book  If you have never read this book  it is a definite MUST READ  Ya comprendo por que es un clasico  Muchisimas son cosas que sabia  pero es un gran resumen y reafirma verlas por escrito  For years I avoided this book  as I found the title to be a little off putting   I was worried the content was going to be full of sleaze like so many others in this niche I ve wasted my time with   cough RobertGreene cough     A clear cut case of  judging a book by its cover    Given it s timelessness and consistent recommendation   I decided to  get it over with        Wow   Despite it s origination date  I really enjoyed this book and found it s content to hold up   If only I d let go of my reservations years prior  I probably could have saved myself years of frustration and anguish in dealing with people  especially the argumentative and or  me  me  me  types  This is another book I m going to have to revisit   multiple times  most likely   in order to absorb and put into practice all the principles laid out for us  Read it  Learn it  Live it   It makes you rethink the way in which you act daily  A must to improve relationships with others  one of the best books I have read    after reading it  I recommend think how you can apply the techniques learnt in the book to your own life as each person is unique and would have been exposed to different scenarios     easily understandable     This book was much more than what the title claims it to be  I found it more to be about being a better friend  co worker  spouse  human than just winning more friends  If people everywhere read this book and took it to heart our world would be a much better place  indeed  Common courtesy  patience  and the ability to see a situation from another s prospective are lost arts in this age of communication via e mails  texts and snapchats  I wish everyone in the world all had Mr  Carnegie s kindness and thoughtfulness  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be a better person inside and out   An oldie but goodie  I really liked it  In order to get the most out of this book  one must take the time to really break down what was just read  The content of this book as many have said is very simple  but also very powerful  When you take the time to study the techniques  learn how to implement them  and actually put them into practice  you have a solid return of your time and money  As mentioned in the first couple of pages in the book  it is very easy to forget the principles if you don t constantly strive to perfect them in everyday life  so it is recommended to read each chapter more than once and then put what you learned into action  I agree    It takes time for it to become second nature  but once you have it all down  you will definitely see peoples interaction with you change for the better I recommend this book to everyone   People love to talk about one thing  themselves  If you are from the league who thinks criticizing  condemning and ridiculing does the job every time  this is for you  The author shows how a little compassion  appreciation and consideration can help you to influence people to get the job done This will teach you a different approach towards your social and professional relations  I absolutely LOVE this book  I read it in college  and it was a great way for me to improve myself  but it didn t make me feel bad  It made me have more confidence and become a more well rounded person  Highly recommended  no matter how introverted or extroverted you view yourself  Very good book about how to communicate with people  elements of psychology and sociology presented in a very down to earth way  using stories as examples  Fantastic book  the art of human relations   Was a bit of a life changer for me    This book made a huge change in my life  Very useful in learning  or re learning  basic interpersonal skills  I am even teaching my daughter some of the steps in it to help her at school  Must read for every manager or salesman   Pilih rakan dan dorong manusia dengan cara yang sama  Setiap manusia adalah mad u dan andalah jua yang memilih untuk mengadaptasi setiap yang dilihat dengan bijak  A must read for everyone  preferably once every year This was an absolute classic and must read  It has become my hand book to all personal interactions  This has become on of my top book reads of all time and something that I contently refer back to for advice and guidance   I really enjoyed this book  Very common sense stuff like remembering people s names and smiling  but such a good reminder  Hope I can influence my kids now and win a ton of friends    I hope to reread this book in the future to remind me its concepts  All time Favourite    Long Live Dale We all seek self and social improvement and this is the book to do so  i recommend it highly and i believe it should be studied like a course in schools and universities because in order for us to develop as humans it is very important to know how to deal with people and how to win them  I love it the section where he wrote tips in how to get the best of the book  I am inspired by Dale story of success and i will read all his other books  I have thoroughly enjoyed this book  I am learning a lot  I am learning how to win friends and influence people I give it five stars  Feel free to disagree but keep in mind  you can never win an argument   Got hired because of this book  Thanks Want to be liked  Read this book  This book is by far the most amazing personal relations communication book I ve ever come across  Normally I find myself drawn to titles by John C  Maxwell  but this book  written as an alternative textbook  is just too incredibly good to miss If you ever plan to have a conversation with another human being  I strongly suggest you read this from front to back and follow the directions outlined in the beginning  As old as this book may be it can teach anyone some valid lessons on how to work with people  Sure  the concepts are simple  though often forgotten  It serves as guidance to those wanting to lead a better more fair life with others  What a great read especially for me considering I m majoring in Business   A must read for everyone  This book should be a must read in every book in all the world  at least once a year  for every degree  If people knew the information inside this book  so many misunderstandings would be avoided between family  friends  co workers  customers  and between every human to human interaction If you haven t read it yet  make the people in your life a favor  and yourself too  and read and apply it s wisdom daily  There are parts where it will make you want to cry for not knowing that stuff sooner  because of all the pain you could have avoided by behaving like it suggests   Life changing experience I do love this book   and anyone who would like to be successful in MLM or business in general should get a copy and work through the items  1930 s book  but still applicable   Excellent introduction to the pseudo science of developing win win relationships   I found the behaviors HTWFIP discusses were both effective and easy to implement   DH had been pressuring me to read this book for AGES but it just did not appeal to me  I can make friends  I m a good leader  And I have never enjoyed reading books that are basically informational  even if they are good  The only one I ve ever finished before was  Leadership and Self Deception  and that was mostly because it is written in story form  However  this book is fantastic  You learn all sorts of wonderful things that help you to be a better friend  leader  parent  spouse    person  It s really wonderful  And you learn the lessons through reading a bunch of short stories that illustrate his different points  It really is great  I had a hard time putting it down  I was SHOCKED and know that it is a book I will read again   a cult classic  have read it umpteen number of times  don t mind reading it another 100 times I cannot express how much i enjoyed and educated my self by reading this book  I will read it again in few months time to reinforce the knowledge i got out off it  This book is an interesting and insightful as I d always heard  Makes me rethink my personality and the ways I interact with others  Lots of real world examples of his advice in action  I read this for my Interpersonal Communications class and Loved it  Brilliant book about relationships  Really nice book   much better than the name sounds  The book is fantastic  The practices he encourages aren t new  I believe to a certain extent everyone subconsciously knows these traits are desirable but until Dale no one had taken the time to really dig into why they re desirable  Everyone should read this book  i loved it and will use it as a reference for years to come   Wow  Why have I not read this before  Brilliant  Though nonfiction  and though it repeats itself several times  this book was phenomenal  After obtaining a sales marketing job for a small company  I boss made all employees to read this book  My boss also had questions for every principle of the book for every section  which made the meetings more like a book club when we are in discussion  Book was wonderful and fascinating  My co worker believed that this book addresses many  common sense  details  which I agreed on  However  to have the ability to outline the principles is something that requires a lot of experience  planning  and acknowledgement of little details learned on a daily basis  There are some principles that some people may have naturally acquire such as  smiling  or even  saving face of another person   Yet  there are other principles that other individuals may not learn and acknowledge the principle  I recommend that this book should be exposed to kids at the high school age  because I personally wished that I read this book prior to entering college  If I was able to read this book prior to entering college  I firmly believe that I would have a lot of easier time understanding how to learn and deal with people   A life changing book  It took a long reading time in order to try to apply what I read  Overall the book is v  good  it s suited to all kind of people  In two words  must read  Thank you Dale Carnegie  it s my first reading for you but it won t be the last  I have heard for years that I should read this book  and now that I have finally gotten around to it  I found I really enjoyed it  Leaders  folks in sales  and literally every person in the world should read and understand the principles described in this book  Most of the chapters relate specifically to things I teach in my social psychology class  which made me happy because it shows the overlap between business  public speaking  and psychology that my students need to be able to see to relate to the content  This is definitely a book to buy  read  and re read once per year to remind yourself of the principles  Great book  definately one for the personal library  I read it after high school and have reviewed it many times since   Everyone should read this book  I read this book years ago once as a college student and didn t implement it into my life  I quickly learned that was a mistake  This is a must read for anyone who is serious about building relationships and growing their business network or career  This book is packed with practical wisdom that you need to use now  A must read  and re read each year  for everyone   One of my favorite all time books  A morality book for atheists  Read more at http   paintroller blogspot com 2007     Even though the title may seem a bit hackneyed and possibly cheesy  this 70 year old book is a great resource  I advise anyone  at least anyone that deals with people on a regular basis  to read this book  Dale Carnegie s approach to interacting with resolving conflicts and motivating others is straightforward and sensical  He wrote this book based on much of the contemporary psychology of the day much of which is still relevant  It s a quick read full of anecdotes that are sometimes dated but all relevant   Classic book that everyone should read  kthr m ymyz

lh w qr h blGth lSlyh fDl Great book with amazing and teaching stories about human interactions  Invaluable in an age where being polite is optional and based upon one s  feelings  about another person  Everyone who expects to be  or desires to be a success in life should read this book  It s all about treating others as you would want to be treated  Truly timeless  A must read for the human race  I prefer the first version the best  it loses something in the updated one  I have read this book first time when I was 19 years old  Absolutely loved all the practical advises that author

getting what they want  Carnegie uses countless real life quotes and examples to enlighten all satisfactory individuals who bother to study its ways of human social interactions  A four part  30 chapter  social bible   this beauty can help even the least sociable of men to become not only an exceptional conversationalist  but an instant friend to anyone he  or she  may come in contact with  If someone asked me what the best way to make friends would be  I would simply hand them a copy of the book and instruct them to carefully read it at least twice and report back  Since Carnegie wrote the book in such easy to understand language  there are no prerequisites to reading and fully understanding it  I can testify that I have learned countless skills on how to do exactly what the title

This is the beauty of the book  it teaches to sculpt the subconscious mind into almost whatever shape you desire  It is quite effective at doing this  which is why I would recommend it to anyone with the lust for a better social figure  On a scale of one to ten  this book would certainly break the scale  Carnegie goes above and beyond in an effort to help build American citizens  sociability   This book is one of my Top Five of All Time  If you interact with people  read it  How to Win Friends and Influence People was written from a training program that Dale Carnegie taught many years ago  It stands the test of time  50 years from now  people will still find use and application for it in their everyday lives  When your book title has become a cliche and means of expression  you know it has become a brand onto itself  This is what got me through the following all at the same time   Long distance relationship  New career which meant moving to a new place with no friends family  Realizing I m poor and getting a 2nd job while starting my career and long distance engagement  Planning my wedding by myself  Moving to SF with a new husband who was a long distance relationship for

find something new each time  Absolutely fantastic book  I have read a few  self help  type books but none has resonated with me like this book has  It makes everything seem so easy  and achievable  I believe I can handle any situation now  I just hope it stays with me   After reading this I understand why it s a classic  I wonder why I waited so long to read it  It s an easy read and full of straight forward techniques to improve your communication and how others relate to you  In particular I loved the back section which was on how to give criticism in a positive way  How to help people not feel picked apart and demoralized by it   one of the best books I have read concerning people skills  Lots of great ideas  inspirational  This is an excellent read  It might not be the most enthralling of reads  but the content is something everyone should absorb  I felt the urge to take notes many times as I was reading this book  and admittedly  I did take notes a few times  I feel the information is so important that I fully intend on going back and taking more detailed notes to incorporate some of this advice into my everyday life  The world would be a better place if we all lived by just one of these tenants  Be hearty in your approbation  and lavish in your praise     Charles Schwabb I just love reading this book  I placed in the bottom of the pile of books to read in 2014  I always love to read this  It reminds me of things I do correctly in handling people  and things I can improve on     One of my all time favourites  A book you can come back to and review again and again   This is a fantastic book  one I read over and over again  I enjoyed this book a lot mostly because I am stubborn and the book reiterates lots of very simple and basic rules for communicating with people  Lots of things you know you should be doing  but aren t  It isn t quite as manipulative as the title suggests  but has lots of great little historical feature type stories inside as it seeks to prove the point of loving other people and treating others as you like to be treated  It s one of those books that should hit your read and re read shelf of life   One of the best business advices I have read Great book   still relevant  A little hokey at times but the information is still solid  Dale Carnegie writes with a rare enthusiasm and affection for people in general  He offers

guide to   basically being a good likeable person   everyone needs to read this twice  I m preparing for a job interview tomorrow  This is a great book  Criticism is futile  enough said  The book focuses majorly on two points ways to make human relations better and introduction about leadership skills  As the first edition of the book was written in 1936 and it should be considered as the mother of all self improvement books  Dale Carnegie himself said that he has not written anything new  he was inspired by the ideas of Socrates  Jesus  and different Presidents in US history  Dale has shared experiences from day to day lives of him and his students to get the concepts better understood A must read for everybody  not just once but again and again during different phases of life

multiple times  Continue to take it off the shelf from time to time and reassess how I m treating other people I just loved this book  Easy ways to succeed in life  Please read this book if you get a chance  I read this book right after my graduation  It was quite easy and enjoying reading  But when I read some part of it  it seemed quite guffy  Anyway  its one of the widely read self help book that I can recommend to any early reader and I am sure that they won t be regretted  I try to listen to this audiobook at least once every couple of years   I read this book many years ago out of self doubt  The ideas in it were wonderfully positive  both for the individual and for one seeking a job  I was interested in the first and learned about positive thinking and acting  about reversing the withdrawn personality etc  Trying to put these into practice was difficult and took years  But gradually and with some help it was possible  The book is excellent for its type  and I recommend it  initially thought it was tacky to read such a book  but i took warren buffet s advice and did so  one of the nicest books I ve ever read  really digs in to fundamental behaviour of people  really enjoyed it and really helps you to effectively understand people and deal with them much better  I read it again after almost 10 years since the first time  Great book on persuasion and negotiation  There are no new fundamentals  I would totally recommend this book to anyone interested in getting better in making deals happen  A great book I regret not having read some ages ago    Everyone should read this book  Por un lado estan los libros de  autoayuda  y por otro esta Dale Carnegie  Es la Biblia de las relaciones humanas Y hay dos opciones  leerlo a toda velocidad y no sacar absolutamente nada o verdaderamente reflexionar y estudiarlo con detenimiento  En apariencia es un libro casi infantil  la realidad es que es un libro complejisimo y que requiere un esfuerzo activo para sacarle verdaderamente provecho Leyendo a Carnegie te sobran el 99  de los llamados libros de  autoyuda   digamos que asi llaman ahora a cualquier cosa que trata sobre las relaciones humanas  emociones  etc   De hecho  la inmensa mayoria no dejan der ser intentos de copia de obras que como esta se escribieron hace la tira de anos  great read for interpersonal communications Hmmm   just some thoughts to myself a lot of cool insight from this book I think it s important to realize that humans are things to be tricked manipulated but rather it s kinda beautiful how we interact with one another and this book should be viewed as a way of enhancing our interactions really applicable things for life I was handed this book as a child and it s one I would highly recommend to anyone old enough to understand the concepts outlined in it s chapters  The decades have proven to me that this book is as relevant and applicable now as it was then and core values never change  Read it  If you understand it  you won t regret it  Good useful book  Even though this book is pretty old in content and quotes  he still knows people   I read this book when I did timeshare sales  which was more than nine years ago  but even up to this day i am still finding it s techniques very useful in meeting people outside of trying to sell an item  Two of the things I still try to remember to do  is to call people by their names  because people like hearing their names called  it gives them a sense of importance  and they also like genuine compliments  If you are marketing anything at all  or would just like to hit it off immediately when you meet some one  this book will be a good one to read  An excellent source of ideas for those who want to be successful in business and life in general  Amazing  All teens should read as it will have an impact in the rest of their lives  Read ASAP  mn fDl lktb lty ttklm  n tHsyn ldhk l jtm y fq kl lktb lty qr th sbq This book could change your life and how the world sees you  I am definitely going to read this for a second time   This is one ofthose rare books I have read multiple times  It is a great refresher  especially when work gets stressful and you need to turn things around  Absolutely love this book  It taught me so much more the second time through  I definitely recommend to all  Knowing how to relate and deal with people with love and confidence that you are relatable to that person is so important  And this book has so much truth  Don t only read  put into action the principles and see people light up when you are around   Excellent book  I need to read it again  Great read for anyone who works with people   i e  everyone  Genius book  Definitely up there on the must read business books   Read this one quite awhile ago  but was reminded of it again  Don t let the title fool you  this is actually a very spiritual book  I loved it  A must read for understanding and dealing with people  Really  an outstanding book  Timeless  I hadn t read this book since high school  All I remember was that it was impactful and it didn t disappoint this time around  Everyone needs to read this one  This will be a yearly read for me  Everyone could use his advice  Love it  This book is a practical  it contains the techniques and principles necessary to develop and sharpen your people skills  When I first read the title I thought only people without friends would want to read it   not the case  very powerful concepts  this book should be read by everybody   Must read for all humans who interact with other humans  The best self help book that can apply to our ordinary life  In the book  How to Win Friends and Influence People   Dale Carnegie persuasively provided the readers more effective communication skills that most people don t know about  This book is well written and credible due to enormous sources of citations and researches that was put into  Dale Carnegie  a successful coach in many aspects of professional work and leadership development  is one of the most thoughtful and competent communicator and writer I had ever knew  I had some opportunities to try his methods of developing relationships and it worked like magic  Therefore  I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to improve their communication skills and leadership management  Embrace the book and learn from it    This is one of my favorites  I reread it often and its perspective is great  Very cheerful and effective  El libro es basico para cualquier ser humano  te habla de una mejoria en tu persona y te

shkhzvr lyv shvb Quite a book   Most of the content is brilliant and you start using on the people around you to check if it really works  You find that it surely does  A short cut to distinction with APPLICATION  This is a must read  At least for me  I love the simple and easy to understand idea  Do on to others   I have probably read this book over 100 times since getting it my senior year in highschool   One of the books a young adult should read  especially if he or she is going to be a people s person  This is a book to stew on  Rather than reading straight through  i kept it in my work bag and read a chapter or two on the bus every morning  This steady influx of reinforcement set my perspective for the day  which resulted in a lot more good days  While none of his points are rocket science  their simplicity is deceptive and implementation isn t always easy nor do they come natural to me  I ll be re reading this book on a regular basis  A must read  I ve read this several times as well   A book I ve heard about for years and assumed it had something to do with manipulating people so was negative to read it  My 19 year old son bought it on audio and persuaded me to listen to it   I was inspired to find it all about the golden rule  putting others first and never humiliating or putting others down  Great read or audio   Classic book  The stories are somewhat too outdated though   I just don t feel connected to the people and stories of 1920s or 30s   Great work about building social skills and behaving in various situation  I learned tons and gained confidence  hope to have chance to reread the book  Every person should make this book a part of their life s curriculum  It is widely considered the bible of human behavior and is a must read for everyone Although it was written in the 1930s  Carnegie s philosophies still hold true  Timeless  Don t borrow it  buy it  You ll be a much better person for having read this book   not only to yourself but for everyone around you  The six ways to make people like you The twelve ways to win people to your way of thinking The nine ways to change people without arousing resentment   enough said lol  One of the best self help book out there  One of must have book I didn t expect to like this book as much as I did  The author broke down his points very concisely amd with obvious knowledge  The stories told did the job of explaining why his points on getting along with others work  quite well  A lot of them are quite common sense  but to take as a whole  I see people and my interaction with them differently  If you are wanting to be better at interaction with others  both in business and relationships elsewhere  read this book and apply his principles  very useful stuff  some minor inconsistencies  as well as troubling implications   This is such a classic  While most of the examples may seem dated the ideas and the lessons are not  In fact  given our current fast paced digital world  this book may be of more importance now than in any other time in history If it s been a while since you ve read it  or if you ve never read it  I highly recommend giving it a read  This was required reading for my Junior Achievment team in HS  I never regreted it  Que buen libro  conciso  lleno de ejemplos de y para la vida real  nada nuevo de hecho  mucho sentido comun  pero tambien mucha sensibilidad  que tambien es lo que nos falta muchas veces  No soy mucho de leer estos libros clasificados como  autoayuda   con ideas de  el cambio esta en ti mismo    la ley de la atraccion   etc   por lo que no sabia que esperar con este  Lo que encontre es basicamente mucha responsabilidad y lo mas importante  tecnicas que se separan de la manipulacion tan solo por la intencion honesta de los actos Creo que es un libro del cual tendre que leer al menos un capitulo cada semana de aqui hasta que logre asimilar y hacer mios estos conceptos  o me muera  cosa que probablemente ocurra primero De verdad  deberia ser libro de texto en las preparatorias y universidades  tendriamos un mejor mundo  Nothing new but great reminders and well told through stories  Glad I finally got to read this classic  Everyone should read this at least once  classic  first heard about this book by overhearing a conversation at a country club  I re read the books on the  top 5  shelf every single year  The September completion was the 3rd time I had gone through it cover to cover   Un libro tan elocuente y tan simple  si  simple y no por eso deja ser excelente     Lo instruido no es secreto de estado  es mas  es una serie de evidencias para lograr ser una excelente persona  y adicional  inculcarlo en los demas  Las rutinas cotidianas de la vida enmarcan tantos principios  que sin el conocimiento adecuado  nos alejan de nuestros objetivos  Esos objetivos son resumidos en reglas que estoy seguro auguran excelentes resultados  El ser humano se hace rodeado de personas  y ese tacto de relacionarse con las personas es la clave de cualquier exito  This book is very useful for becoming a better negotiator and even a better person in general  I plan on rereading this book just to make sure I picked up on everything  I am interested in social psychology  and this is one of the best books on the subject that I ve ever read   You have to read this book    Really Amazing   D sbb tmm ltqyym ryd  lktb fy

has  Love this book  so informational and motivating  Doporucuji vsem  kteri si preji efektivne vyjadrovat svoje nazory a znat mechanismy jednani s lidmi  Prozatim nejlepsi a nejzajimavejsi kniha z tech  ktere jsem cetl  Kdyz uvazime  ze cely nas zivot  veskere nase snazeni je vzdy bezprostrednim ci zprostredkovanym jednanim s lidmi  uspech pri jednani s lidmi je uspechem uspechu    David Gruber  1992 We all hear about books that should be taught in schools  well this is truly one of them  If we all were a bit more thoughtful and respectful to others  not only would it make the world a better place  but our own lives would be that much more fulfilling  The values it teaches are priceless and are far more valuable today  than when the book was written  When I first came across this book  it was presented as a sales person book  however  I would like to view it more as a character building book for all people  Some of the concepts seem straight forward but their application is life changing  Carnegie has such a natural tone in his writing  It feels like having a conversation with him  Even 70  year seperated from the original publication  the lessons in this book are extremely applicable to business and personal applications  mn mt  lktb lt  qrth f  Hyt  knt dhhb lqry th byn lfyn  wlkhr  mtlhf     t lmt mnh lkthyr wtthrt bh Hq   f  tqdyr  mmt  l  bd Hd wmfyd wsls llGy   This is a fantastic book  Many of the ideas put forth seem so obvious once you read them  You ll have probably heard similar words before but you ll find that rarely do you put them all into practice  Although his  sometimes unusual  examples are selected carefully to prove his points  Carnegie does a great job compiling and organizing practices that should be made second nature for those looking to enhance personal and professional relationships  The ideas are all so simple  yet so powerful  and can be implemented by anyone with a genuine interest in other people  It is not a book on theory  trickery  or insincere seduction  but rather a practical book on good manners and recognizing or appreciating others  I will continue to review this from from time to time with the intention of truly embedding a significant portion of his principles into my character  without having to consciously think about it  The beauty of this book is that each idea can be implemented immediately and the results are visible just as quick  Highly recommended  Great book  written over 70 years ago and the same principles still apply today   Should be required reading to graduate from high school  I actually liked this book  I checked out from the library but I will def buy my own copy and read it again  Most books like these are so stuffy you have to force yourself to read it  This was not the case with this book  The chapters aren t too long so you can get a little bit in each day  even on a busy schedule  This book has been in publication for quite some time but the techniques and skills are still very much relevant  needed and works  I recommend this book  To be loved  you must love first  To be considered  you must consider first  To be respected  guess what  you must respect first  When you recieve  never forget  When you give  never remember   Probably the most important book you MUST read if you want to start your own business All go to book every year I found this book in my school library  and ever since I read it  Dale Carnegie became my favourite author This book literally helped me resolve situations which appeared helplessly complicated It helps you influence people not by rhetorically tricking them  but by employing the best aspects of your character in order to build rapport with the others Surely recommend it  life changing book    Should be required reading for every student in the 6th grade  Full of useful advice and insight  Opens your mind to how to better work with people and understand where they are coming from  His methods really do work  This is a great read  As you read it  think about how you talk to people and how you can change some of your relationships   It gives real examples about how to behave people and lead them  This will be one I read again for notes  Loved it  A very nice read there  Gonna read it again sometimes to re learn and re live the insights   D This book sat in my parents bookshelf for all the years I was growing up  My dad may have read it  as he was a master at business relationships  Recently it came to my attention again in an interview with Warren Buffet  who said it was one of the most important books he ever read  He said that he takes this book with him every where he goes and re reads it often  Written in 1936 it s still completely applicable today   one of the most effective tools for managing relationships  It s an easy read and everyone should read it   Speechless    I have so many phrases from this book in my memory that it seems like I printed them there  it s a WONDERFUL book  I only can say that  100  Recommended  My first book in business psychology  Dale Carnegie s book is the perfect example of what timeless advice truly looks like  Though first published in 1936  his advice on how to foster positive relationships both in business and in our personal lives still rings true today  Make whoever you come across feel important  such a simple concept that is so often ignored in our daily lives  This book is well written with a plethora of examples  If you can acknowledge that Carnegie s advice will not work in all situations this can be incredibly transformative in the majority of your interactions  This is not a book of magic tricks or short cuts  It is a book on human relationships  This is definitely worth reading multiple times as a constant reminder to acknowledge those around us   a classic through and through  wish i had read this thing 15 years ago  friends  relationships  colleagues   i m sorry I just got to this one   Excellent book for improving social skills A book that everyone growing in a generation that s all about  me  should read You d think learning to be quiet and actively listen to people  learn about them  and be excited about their life would prove to be a difficult experience  But Carnegie weaves this how to into an elegant and fun read I ve always been a person who was interested in others and thought I knew how to make friends  This book humbled me and made me see how I could change  As a result  I have loyal people in my life like I never have before  Highly recommended for anybody  Despite this book being 70 years old  it is not at all anachronistic  The principles Carnegie teaches are the same today as they were yesterday  It could be argued that more than ever we need to learn them today as society is forgetting how to just talk to each other  Other reviewers say this is only useful to sales people  If so  then we all need to read this book because we are all constantly selling our selves to those around us  Great  easy and short read  Fantatstic work with lots of examples The author died at least 50 years ago  The society  world has changed so much since  So one may feel this book not informative enough But some rules of this book are timeless  Read it not to miss a Classic  As long as people inhabit the Earth this book will be relevant   The BEST book about communication I ve ever read  I apply the things I ve learned to this DAILY  One of my first self help books that I happened to read by chance  and this is primarily the reason why I started reading a lot of books Well worth the money  This also happens to be my most favourite book to give as a gift  Making good relationships with the people around us makes a healthy and friendly environment to work with or to stay with  This book tells us the way to make that happen  Its all about the way we to talk to others  and treat them  The principles Dale Carnegie describes in this book  truly helps to improve the way we act in a particular situation  Appreciation  Encouragement  Having smile always on face and more are the strong tools to build the better relationship with people  I strongly recommend everyone to read this book  Thank you  I wish I had read this book when I was younger  I would have learned how to get along with people and bring them around to my perspective instead of arguing with them  This book was included in my book  The 100 Best Business Books of All Time  www 100bestbiz com A must read book for anyone desiring to succeed in life  What a great book  Simple ideas yet make a massive difference  There is a part in this book called father forgets  its probably one of the most influential parts of this book  Well at least for me  If you have argumentative friends you most definitely want to recommend this book for them  I am surprised it was written a long time ago   Good advice never perish    Amazing read  Filled with stories of people  from all walks of life  gaining confidence in themselves and achieving what they never thought possible  This was one of my favorite books  He has a positive attitude  I used to go to the bookstore and found him in there so I always looked for his books  This is a yearly must read  Principles are applied to husbands and kids and everyone else  I need to be reminded of these things often  Great principles  A must read for people like me    An amazing book that has completely changed the way I interact with people since I first read it years ago  I think he recommends that people read it at least once a year which I think it good advice    and which I have not done  It s definitely one worth revisiting  Though written nearly a century ago  this book still rings true  Dale Carnegie s  How to Win Friends and Influence People  deals primarily with basic human nature and how most of us share the same basic sentiments in how we would prefer to be treated  It is not a book about high platitudes or ideas  but rather a basic  how to  approach to interacting with people on a personal and professional level  I was put off by the title at first  but after reading it  admit that it was nothing I had initially expected it to be  One of best books I have ever read  I learned a lot from this book  I highly recommend it  Actually  this book should be required reading The only negative thought I have about the book is sometimes it feels like he tells to many stories to get his point across   Awesome book written in a very unique style I actually read this books years ago and decided to pick it up and read it again  this time taking notes on notecards and keeping them nearby so that I will have a daily reminder of how to better myself and to pay attention to the needs of others   my father bought this book for me

1937  A revised edition of the book was released in 1981 The book s sole purpose is to help people solve the biggest problems they face  the problem of getting along with and influencing people in their everyday  business and social contacts  The content of the book is told through and based on the personal experiences of the author himself and of his students from his courses in Effective Speaking and Human Relations  It focuses primarily on the do s and don ts in interacting with people  and emphasizes the things that should be remembered when a certain  undesirable  situation arises I truly enjoyed reading How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie because of how useful and helpful it is when it comes to dealing with people  The points were made out clearly and the author wrote it with all love and sincerity  There s nothing fake or unreal about it  Trying to follow all the principles pointed out in the book can be very challenging  because human as we are  we all have flaws  but the simple fact that you tried to follow the fundamental rules in dealing with people in your own sincere little way gives not only great joy but also great satisfaction  While it is a human story  it is told so that all humans will understand it and relate to it If you are like me and love to read books to help improve oneself in a very positive way  you will love How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie  This book is a very precious piece of literature and will surely bring out the best in you if you try to absorb its message by heart  I whole heartedly

Dave Carnegie broadened the ways I view running a business as well as dealing with people  The book provided an ample amount of examples that put the way I viewed human relations into a better more clear perspective  This is definitely something that I m going to re read every year   Really easy fun read  really applicable for any business person  This is one of the best self help books I ve

so many good ideas that all make sense  Most of his ideas aren t new concepts  but I love all the anecdotes that put the concepts into real life perspectives  I want to re read this book over and over and use these principles with my kids and family especially  This is an important work in which I can see why it has been a huge bestseller for 80 years  The advice is so practical and clear  you wonder why there are so few people with these great skills  A successful person can apply these ideas likely without trying  The rest of us can learn from the wisdom of the many great people quoted here  Abraham Lincoln  Teddy Roosevelt  Charles Schwab  Ben Franklin  You can read this and be an improved human the next day The advice is presented as a series of principles to follow  accompanied by many anecdotes that show how well these techniques work  from famous figures and everyday Americans  collected from Dale Carnegie s classes I m tempted to make a PowerPoint slideshow to make sure I

this book is very informative  Also  I have a background in behavior psychology and the usage of social reinforcement is well documented in this book  This is an amazing book  I dislike that the title reads like a woo self help book  but everything between the covers is golden  It provides a plethora of tips and strategies to effectively deal with people in a way that caters to human emotion over rational thought  I ve tried out only a few of these ideas and noticed an immediate positive difference in the way people received me  I m posting these principles up in my room so I don t forget them

of how these tools work  I plan to re read this again  which I never do  just to be sure I remember all the tips  Definitely worth a place on my bookshelves   A couple small tweaks to the advice in this book and you have basically bought yourself an express ticket to Poontown    Dale Carnegie is a well researched author that supports his points in this timeless self help book with sound reasoning and plenty of engaging stories  I recommend listening to the Andrew MacMillan narrated version of the audio book  I will be reading and referencing this book again  possibly many times  When I read this book many times I felt like someone was punching me in the stomach  It made me realize I could be treating people better and I had a lot of improvements to make in my life  I highly recommend this book for those interested in bettering their leadership ability  I read this book when I was 15 years old and it changed my life      It made me aware of people and what is important to them and to place their needs in front of my own       Just re read it and it is just as true and valid today as it was nearly 50 years ago        I understand that everyone will not agree with the ideas on this book  but for me it s an eye opener  In my opinion  probably the best book out there on persuasion and human behavioural psychology   Every time I re read this book I learn more life lessons  This book relates to all types of people and spans across time with its universal knowledge of how to work and live with others  This book was AMAZING  I would recommend it to everyone  From the title of the book I wasn t sure what to expect  The book takes the wonderful approach of sincerity  With each lesson he makes sure to stress the fact that the points will only work if they are sincere  The whole point of the book is to behave in such a way that the other person feels important and valued  while still getting the task at hand done  It is about lifting others to reach their full potential  I loved the fact that in most of the examples the job got done  but the person in charge was not the only one who was satisfied with the job well done  I m terrible at writing reviews  but of all the books I ve read recently this one is probably the absolute BEST  Interesting Quotes  Any fool can criticize  condemn and complain   and most fools do  But it takes character and self control to be understanding and forgiving   Dale Carnegie  How to Win Friends and Influence People                                  The difference between appreciation and flattery  That is simply  One is sincere and the other insincere  One comes from the heart out  the other from the teeth out  One is unselfish  the other selfish  One is universally admired  the other universally condemned   Dale Carnegie  How to Win Friends and Influence People                                    At one time I rented the grand ballroom of a certain New York hotel for twenty nights in each season in order to hold a series of lectures   At the beginning of one season  I was suddenly informed that I should have to pay almost three times as much rent as formerly  This news reached me after the tickets had been printed and distributed and all announcements had been made   Naturally  I didn t want to pay the increase  but what was the use of talking to the hotel about what I wanted  They were interested only in what they wanted  So a couple of days later I went to see the manager    I was a bit shocked when I got your letter   I said   but I don t blame you at all  If I had been in your position  I should probably have written a similar letter myself  Your duty as the manager of the hotel is to make all the profit possible  If you don t do that  you will be fired and you ought to be fired  Now  let s take a piece of paper and write down the advantages and the disadvantages that will accrue to you  if you insist on this increase in rent    Then I took a letterhead and ran a line through the center and headed one column  Advantages  and the other column  Disadvantages    I wrote down under the head  Advantages  these words   Ballroom free   Then I went on to say   You will have the advantage of having the ballroom free to rent for dances and conventions  That is a big advantage  for affairs like that will pay you much more than you can get for a series of lectures  If I tie your ballroom up for twenty nights during the course of the season  it is sure to mean a loss of some very profitable business to you     Now  let s consider the disadvantages  First  instead of increasing your income from me  you are going to decrease it  In fact  you are going to wipe it out because I cannot pay the rent you are asking  I shall be forced to hold these lectures at some other place     There s another disadvantage to you also  These lectures attract crowds of educated and cultured people to your hotel  That is good advertising for you  isn t it  In fact  if you spent five thousand dollars advertising in the newspapers  you couldn t bring as many people to look at your hotel as I can bring by these lectures  That is worth a lot to a hotel  isn t it   As I talked  I wrote these two  disadvantages  under the proper heading  and handed the sheet of paper to the manager  saying   I wish you would carefully consider both the advantages and disadvantages that are going to accrue to you and then give me your final decision   I received a letter the next day  informing me that my rent would be increased only 50 percent instead of 300 percent   Mind you  I got this reduction without saying a word about what I wanted  I talked all the time about what the other person wanted and how he could get it  Suppose I had done the human  natural thing  suppose I had stormed into his office and said   What do you mean by raising my rent three hundred percent when you know the tickets have been printed and the announcements made  Three hundred percent  Ridiculous  Absurd  I won t pay it   What would have happened then  An argument would have begun to steam and boil and sputter   and you know how arguments end  Even if I had convinced him that he was wrong  his pride would have made it difficult for him to back down and give in  Here is one of the best bits of advice ever given about the fine art of human relationships   If there is any one secret of success   said Henry Ford   it lies in the ability to get the other person s point of view and see things from that person s angle as well as from your own    Dale Carnegie  How to Win Friends and Influence People                                                    You don t feel like smiling  Then what  Two things  First  force yourself to smile  If you are alone  force yourself to whistle or hum a tunr or sing  Act as if you were already happy  and that will tend to make you happy        Everybody in the world is seeking happiness   and there is one sure way to find it  That is by controlling your thoughts  Happiness doesn t depend on outward conditions  It depends on inner conditions   Dale Carnegie  How to Win Friends and Influence People                                                     So if you aspire to be a good conversationalist  be an attentive listener  To be interesting  be interested  Ask questions that other persons will enjoy answering  Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments   Remember that the people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems  A person s toothache means more to that person than a famine in China which kills a million people  A boil on one s neck interests one more than forty earthquakes in Africa  Think of that the next time you start a conversation   Dale Carnegie  How to Win Friends and Influence People                                         Bits   Pieces  published by The Economic Press  Fairfield  N J   How to Keep a Disagreement from Becoming an Argument http   www turnedondigital com 2011 h                                                           Years ago  when I was a barefoot boy walking through the woods to a country school out in northwest Missouri  I read a fable about the sun and the wind  They quarreled about which was the stronger  and the wind said   I ll prove I am  See the old man down there with a coat  I bet I can get his coat off him quicker than you can   So the sun went behind a cloud  and the wind blew until it was almost a tornado  but the harder it blew  the tighter the old man clutched his coat to him  Finally  the wind calmed down and gave up  and then the sun came out from behind the clouds and smiled kindly on the old man  Presently  he mopped his brow and pulled off his coat  The sun then told the wind that gentleness and friendliness were always stronger than fury and force  The use of gentleness and friendliness is demonstrated day after day by people who have learned that a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall   Dale Carnegie  How to Win Friends and Influence People                                  Remember that other people may be totally wrong  But they don t think so  Don t condemn them  Any fool can do that  Try to understand them  Only wise  tolerant  exceptional people even try to do that  There is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does  Ferret out that reason   and you have the key to his actions  perhaps to his personality   Dale Carnegie  How to Win Friends and Influence People                                   Wouldn t you like to have a magic phrase that would stop arguments  eliminate ill feeling  create good will  and make the other person listen attentively  Yes  All right  Here it is   I don t blame you one iota for feeling as you do  If I were you I would undoubtedly feel just as you do   An answer like that will soften the most cantankerous old cuss alive  And you can say that and be 100 percent sincere  because if you were the other person you  of course  would feel just as he does       Three fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsting for sympathy  Give it to them  and they will love you   Dale Carnegie  How to Win Friends and Influence People                                         I knew a man who had to refuse many invitations to speak  invitations extended by friends  invitations coming from people to whom he was obligated  and yet he did it so adroitly that the other person was at least contented with his refusal  How did he do it  Not by merely talking about the fact that he was too busy and too this and too that  No  after expressing his appreciation of the invitation and regretting his inability to accept it  he suggested a substitute speaker  In other words  he didn t give the other person any time to feel unhappy about the refusal  He immediately changed the other person s thoughts to some other speaker who could accept the invitation    Dale Carnegie  How to Win Friends and Influence People                                            Great Book This book was great  Easy to read and insightful  this is a must read book for everyone   I first read it decades ago  but I recently re read and made my employees read it as well  It changed the moral of all my employees in a great way  A must read for every avid readers  Favourite book of Warren buffett  The book will influence your life  guaranteed  In general  I do not read self help books  I find them preachy and uninspiring  This book  however  was highly recommended by a blogger whose post convinced me to give it a shot  I m glad I did  Though the principles are probably common sense  motivate through praise rather than criticism  listen without interrupting  smile  make the other person feel important  etc    I believe it did me some good to hear them all laid out in such a straightforward manner  Everybody else on the planet is just as self absorbed as I am  and they care far more about what they want than what I want  Each chapter began with a principle  described it a little in general  then listed anecdote after anecdote about the principle in action  Most telling to me was the repeated assurance that these techniques only work if the feeling behind them in genuine  not manipulative  People can see through flattery This book was first published in 1936  and we certainly have not become a more genteel society since then  I wonder what Carnegie would think of the internet and its trolls  For much of the book I could imagine people hearing the advice and thinking   Yes  This is how other people should treat me   But of course that s not the point  The point is that if you treat other people this way  you will benefit  Sometimes this will be through convincing people to come around to your way of thinking  but more often just by spreading good will  Had this book been written a few decades later  I m sure karma would have been mentioned more than once Though a couple of the techniques described might come off as passive aggressive today  by and large it s a good resource   a good reminder for how to deal with other people  to give and receive criticism gracefully  and generally improve your attitude  I hereby recommend it to everyone on the planet  In return  I will attempt to practice its principles in my own life more often  I can t promise I ll always be successful   three decades of acerbity do not disappear overnight  after all   but I can try  There s a reason that this book has sold millions of copies and is still in print after 75 years  Carnegie hits on fundamental aspects of human nature and how empathy will diffuse arguments and influence most people  By appealing to the other person s vanity and highest ideals  insinuating ideas  letting the other person do most of the talking  speaking in terms of the other person s interests  allowing the other to save face  by  throwing down a challenge   etc   you can turn anyone into a friend or influence them to your way of thinking  I highly recommend this book  Definitely a must read for everyone  It s crazy that the original version was written in 1936  The examples Dale gives is pretty detailed  from a letter that Lincoln never sent to one of his Generals to his own experiences from years of research  I ll be reading this again  Doc cuon sach khi nghe nhieu nguoi bao hay lam  hay lam  doc di  Doc luc dau cung thay binh thuong  cung cuoi ngua xem hoa vi da phan nhung dieu nay minh da tung trai nghiem trong

make people like you  win people to your way of thinking  change people without offending them  and to make home life happier   I ve read it twice now  and will likely read it again soon   One of those books that really can change your life and make you a better person  if you read it at the right time  I was a teenager when I finished it  and while I wouldn t say it cured my social awkwardness altogether  I was much more able to relate to people and understand conversations after finishing it  It gets my highest possible recommendation  This is as essential reading as my Bible  I love this book  and I re read it every year  If you wish to live out the golden rule  this book is a quality road map and pleasure to read  Fantastic  EVERYONE should read this  This book clearly explains how you must behave with people and make them interested in you  and finally win them as your friends for life   This book is filled with wisdom and practical techniques for dealing with everyday situations in your relations with people  After reading it  I feel like I can more easily get along with people  influence people and get them to do what I want  within reason  without a hassle  Dale Carnegie teaches in this book that to change people s attitudes and behaviors  begin with praise and honest appreciation  Call attention to people s mistakes indirectly  Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person  Ask questions instead of giving orders  etc  This is certainly a must read for anyone who desires success in human relations  Best book on the subject you will ever find  A read and reread throughout your life  a definite must for everyone  Buku ini banyak menginspirasi cara manusia berhubungan dengan manusia lainya  Interesting book  more so in audiobook form   the novelty of which still hasn t worn off for me   haha   Great principles to follow although you probably should keep in mind to not end up being a doormat following said principles

possible  One of the best books I ve ever read  Its advice is timeless and life changing   Save the gospel itself  and my mission president  this book has been the single most influential thing in my

meet is my superior in some way  In that  I learn of him   Emerson  As quoted by Dale Carnegie  How to Win Friends and Influence People  p  31  You will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong  That will       inspire your opponent to be just as fair and open       as you are  It will make him want to admit that he  too  may be wrong   Dale Carnegie  How to Win Friends and Influence People  p  125  Any fool can criticize  condemn  and complain  and most fools do  But it takes character and self control to be understanding and forgiving   A great man shows his greatness   said Carlyle   by the way he treats little men    Criticisms are like homing pigeons  They always return home  Let s realize that the person we are going to correct and condemn will probably justify himself or herself  and condemn us in return  There is a certain degree of satisfaction in having the courage to admit one s errors  It not only clears the air of guilt and defensiveness  but often helps solve the problem created by the error   Dale Carnegie  How to Win Friends and Influence People  p  138 But my  1  favorite principle from this book is DEFINITELY   If there is any one secret of success  it lies in the ability to get the other person s point of view and see things from that person s angle as well as from your own    That is so simple  so obvious       yet 90 percent of the people on this earth ignore it 90 percent of the time   Henry Ford  then Dale Carnegie  How to Win Friends and Influence People  p  37  Buen libro de superacion personal   The book might fall out of fashion with some young readers  But it s recommended to give this book to them as soon as they can read text books  We need more books for making better living  Good book with a lot of useful thoughts  I know  I know  I need the help    for those of you familiar  I m sure you ve read it and loved it  for those who aren t  this is a business classic  Carnegie goes over very common sense and practitical habits that all people should build  what i loved about it was the examples he gives  the extent some of the famous figures in history have used these habits are incredible   Definitely from the time period when the  extrovert ideal  was king  as discussed in  Quiet  by Susan Cain   However  there are some critical takeaways such as active listening and motivating that remain

book is timeless  This is one to read again and again   Possibly the most important book ever written  If the measure of a book is whether it provokes you to change  then I am sure this book is more than worth the time I took to read it  On my list to read twice every year  Essentially  how to be a good dude  Not a great dude  nor a holy dude  but there are some good nuggets of wisdom in here  This book should should be read by anybody Outdated accounts and examples of the philosophies being practiced  but overall effective at describing the necessary attitude and behavior that will influence people and coincidently win friends  Clearly deserving its classic status  Dale Carnegie s folksy wisdom rings true nearly 80 years after it was penned  Carnegie uses anecdotes and research alike to demonstrate the needs of human nature  emphasizing that an authentic interest in others  which is most people s number one priority and area of expertise   is the best way to get along with and ingratiate yourself to others  Lesson upon lesson of selflessness and patience are excellent reminders as we polish our social skills with these intuitive truths  Everyone should have to read this book at least once in their lifetime  In my Library  this is the Best Self Development book of All Time  This book is a guide to life  I think several people should be required to read this book at least once  Teachers  emotional teenagers  employers  employees  husbands  wives  brothers  sisters  friends  neighbors  politicians etc   I truly found this book oddly entertaining  Although it is a self improvement type book  I couldn t put it down  Through the examples of many famous and successful people throughout history  this book teaches us how to work with others and be nice  I sincerely believed that my ability to effectively communicate and work with other people improved exponentially through reading this book and putting what I learned into action I love this book and am going to require that my children read it before they get a job  a drivers  license  or a date   you will know how to act so fantastic Simple yet effective and applicable to everyone  An amazing book  I truly believe that applying these principles can change your life  and the lives of those around you  for the better  This is an incredible book  I had to read this during college years ago and didn t get much out of it  Now I am in the working world and appreciate this book more then ever  A lot of the techniques Dale Carnegie talks about can be apply to an everyday relationship and what a difference it makes   I first read  How to win friends and influence people  way back in January 2000  That s nearly 15 years ago  It had a profound effect on me  Yes  it is a little old and there is more up to date advice on a few of the points in other books  But I ve re read it every couple of years as it contains imperative guidance for all sorts of situations   whether networking  selling or resolving conflicts  It changes your whole way of thinking  For the better  Great Book  really inspiring and helpful  Offering a complete set of ready to apply advises and techniques  Old fashion writing style and classical real life examples make the book a little bit hard to follow  unless you skip some of the  Story  details  and directly jump to the conclusion or the advise offered by the author  Excellent book and now after reading it I see exactly why this is one of the all time best classics  these principles and skills are of much importance for any sane human being to help deal with society and people in a mututal beneficial manner without the crap we get   we all do Waseem Mirzahttp   www WaseemMirza net A must read for everyone  life changing ideas   Odna iz velichaishikh knig

bol shiom smysle etogo slova  A must readNot only for business people but for anyone who wants to be a better self  Easy and entertaining to read  i read this book in 8th grade and it changed my life  Brilliant and easy to follow I grow up in a very competitive environments and struggled along the way to achieve what I have accomplished now  Throughout the time  I am comparing myself with people around me  and try to prove that I am better than others in academic and other fields  I also like to share my moment of joy on social network to manifest that I am leading a good life  As a result  a lot of people stay away from me  since it seems like I am only concerned about myself  and do not pay attention to others  which is not true  After reading the book  I have been trying to control my self esteem  and try to make other people feel that they are appreciated by me from the bottom of my heart  I am not outgoing person who would like express appreciation  but I will try my best from now on for both my families and people around me  I hope that in a few years  I can have more friends  and enjoy my life more with them  I found this book on a bunch of  must read books  list  the first couple times I saw it didn t think much about it  but after A couple searches I decided there must be something to it  This book is like a text book for human interaction which as the book illustrated is the most important quality while going through life  I half expected this book to get really boring but for every lesson in the book that the writer gives several examples on historical figured that used the same practices in their lives all the time  like lincoln or other successful people   I can use all the help I can get  Life changing  Simple principles that we all know  but not like this  Everything is set out before you to capitalise on and understand on a whole new level  One of the best books    This book doesn t need a review    I am 13 and my dad recommended this for me and just let me tell you    IT CHANGED MY PERSPECTIVE ON EVERYTHING    Love this    A must read  it will change your mindset I would say this is the best book on the market about how to win with people  and how to treat them  This book totally changed my attitude about how I should and do treat people  MUST MUST READ  Regardless of your occupation  I loved this book  It s so simple yet so brilliant  I m a naturally shy person and I thought this book could give me tips to make me feel more confident in social settings where I don t know anyone  I tried out some of his techniques at a party recently and I had no trouble making conversation with strangers  The advice in this book is really timeless  It was an eye opening read and has given me a new way to think and interact with people  I highly recommend it  A classic whose message is appropriate for any century  If you can t interact effectively with people so they know  like and trust you  then it is difficult to do business in a world where your reputation  good or bad  can be discovered on the internet by millions  Good lessons in this book have stood the test of time  I wondered why I hadn t read this before  Made me think and look internally at how I deal with people  This book is amazing  It s probably the only interesting nonfiction book I have ever read  Dale Carnegie s advice is supplemented by real life stories that prove how caring about what other people want and creating a win win situation can really work and can lead to success   whether in business or just in everyday life  Read it many years ago       Worked for me  A must read for everyone  at any stage of life  I will revisit this again and again  There is a reason why some books have yet to go out of print despite it being decades old   Very useful  i like the way the author talk about it i wanna finish this book ASAP  The first book that I read that showed me how people like to be treated  Excellent book and in fact I need to reread it  It s been too long  full of anecdotes and not exactly a page turner  but it speaks the truth about human nature and really makes a lot of sense  should try to condense it and put it into practice now  Ini adalah buku yang pertama kali menginspirasi saya untuk menjadi seseorang yang lebih baik  dan mendorong untuk selalu maju  Diperkenalkan oleh salah seorang teman  Dan dari buku ini saya mulai menjadi semakin rajin berkunjung ke toko buku untuk melihat dan mengoleksi buku buku pengembangan diri  No soy un lector asiduo a este tipo de literatura  sin embargo me quise dar la oportunidad de leer lo que durante anos me negue a aceptar como una posibilidad  Les soy sincero    tenia una idea equivocada de este libro    no es el tipico libro de pseudomotivacion personal    es un libro realmente enfocado a darte conocimiento respecto al trato con la gente con la que te relacionas  Aunque fue escrito hace muchas decadas  este libro contiene informacion que sin importar el paso del tiempo permanece vigente  Un  must read  sin duda  I hope I Will Find My Point  It such a great book really helped me to make friends and even made keep them  Excellent and worth its weight in gold  Going to a technical school didn t exactly grace me with killer people skills  I only wish that I had read this book in high school  although I may not have appreciated it so much  every human should read this book A book to study  not skim  In taking it seriously  however  it hurt me to realize how poorly I have treated others without knowing it    Why 5 stars   you might ask  Knowing that I basically loathe self help books  Considering that the book reads like someone summarizing really touching stories his cousins or acquaintances forwarded in an e mail   This really happened   Forward to 10 people or you ll burn in Hell 4ever  Thanx    Well  you always get kudos for being the one to launch a genre  And while the writing may not be  the advice is pretty damn timeless  People do like to talk about themselves  Appeal to nobler motives  Let the other person feel the idea is theirs  Smile a lot  I d tell you more  but I don t want to give away all the secrets I use to manipulate you  It was required reading in my 12th grade business class  I liked it because it was practical  I still remember many of these principles  After I read this book  I have a lot of friends  Two thumb   When the first time I heard of this book  I thought it s another guide of how to live your life for dummies  It attracted my attention when I realised it has been around for much longer than I thought  namely since 1936  This is one of the most important books I read in my life so far  Really good book  I cheated unfortunately  and listened to it while driving to Boise ID  Taught good techniques to be a better individual and please people  I couldn t help thinking this book taught salesmen how to better deceive people into buying their product  Fortunately  the author made points to tell his readers to be genuine in their approach to everybody you meet  not only attempt to  get something out of them   The book had a lot of key points on being a better person that are valuable for anyone in any situation  If I were to use these key points I d probably jump up to management really quick in my career field  due to an ability to get along well with people  If I met anyone that had all the characteristics of this book I d sure get along very well with them If you don t want to read the book  I d say look for the highlights online somewhere and you can save a lot of time and get what you really need out of the book   If you re   a bit anti social  you think you re too shy to make new friends  you think you can t make make friends because you re boring  you want to convince people to pursue your decision or to think like you do  you don t have leadership people skills  and believe me you need it   you re joining an organization and you need to get noticed  you basically want to survive social life because everything in this book is needed to add to your life skills this is a book about common social interaction  or social interaction that has had its time of being common  Nowadays this book should be required junior high reading so people will grow up having some common decency  manners  and thoughtfulness towards others which would probably result in more social interactions improving dramatically i remember talking with a teenager about using common decency and common sense     and she said she thought there was nothing common about them  or else more people would be using them i think this is an important book  There are many tools that help you to be a better person to spare appreciation to people and become in many cases a leader  Praise and a big smile to share your happiness  A highly entertaining little slice of genius    This is my life philosophy   waaaw    pokokny recommended bgt laaa buat yang anti sosial    ni buku  bikin banyak temen bgt  kereen bgt   Dale Carnegie   Jeniuuus   D This book really taught me great things  I think the title  How to Deal with People  suits more It isn t the best but it sure is a must read book I actually applied everything I could from this book  it really helped There is another book that has the same principles it is called  Enjoy your Life     stmt  bHytk  it is also very nice  Great BookI rather enjoyed the practicality of the approaches Carnegie uses and the endless examples of success from each lesson  I now feel ready top be an effective leader   amazing  Simply amazing  I looked at life in a whole new way  Looked at complaining in a more constructive way  This is the best book I think I ve ever read  Dale Carnegie s principles for communication are still practiced today  This is one of my favourite books because it reminds us to listen for the intent of hearing someone out and not for crafting a reply  for putting people first in conversations and practicing empathy It s an easy read but one you will go back to again and again  One of the all time great self help books  Thanks to Dale for this gem  An absolute must read for anyone who wants to understand the fundamentals of human dynamics  Best used as a frequent reminder on how we should best behave  to be read over and over again  Everyone should read this book  A classic  The book just jumped out of the Bookstore s shelf  figuratively of course  at a time when I was doing FB publication studies for our website  The timing was perfect as I needed to know if I was on the right track  The result is an incredible community of masters from diverse backgrounds coming together for the love of sublime arts  Tielhard de Chardin could not have been more right about his  noosphere  in the digital age  when Dale Carnegie s advice is still so aptly most admissible  I believe this classic text is still most relevant  If you actually care about other people  Carnegie s advice will already be second nature  but you will still enjoy the amusing stories and anecdotes he uses to demonstrate his concepts  I enjoyed this book and will probably read it again in the future  Amazing  Never read anything like this before  One of the best known motivational books in history  Since it was released in 1936  How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie has sold more than 15 million copies  Carnegie s first book is timeless and appeals equally to business audiences  self help audiences  and general readers  I am very impressed with the book  The title merely describe the book  it is more than that because Dale highlighted appreciation and sincerity throughout this book  It is a must read book if you aim to develop people skills and develop the better ways to communicate with people whether in business  friendship  and family  I was so positively influenced by this book as a teen I now give it away on  loan  and never get them back  I always give the cavoit to give it to someone else too  I have given twenty books away and gave ten last year in rememberance of E  personallity   I think I have changed a lot after reading this book  Apply this in real life and you will never be disappointed   I read this book when I was 17 years old  I was hesitant because of the title and I took offense when I was recommended this book  Turned out to be one of the best books I ve read and changed me dramatically for the better  Everybody should read this book  Everybody  y tbr ktb  kyf tksb l Sdq wtw thr fy lns  mn  kthr lktb mby an wntshran fy l lm  dh

retarded  Excellent livre qui donne des resultats immediat  A reminder of how the phrasing of your words could be detrimental to the success of a project  relationship or business  I am surprised to read such negativity in the reviews   there s nothing dishonest in these pages  Be a good person and work hard to be self aware   your peers  reports  clients and bosses will thank you  A great book full of helpful insights in how to treat people that makes both them and you feel better  Some parts could be bordering on seeming  manipulative  but I think the author does a good job of reiterating the importance of being genuine and honest  Really  it s just a different way to look at things  Definitely a book I want to add to my library and refer to often  Picked up on a few more things this time around  Great read  One of my all time favorites  and word I try to live by   hdh ktb   blf l lb lrwHy ll lqt l mh   ktb ry   jd Great book with learnings built on core values of human relationships Easy listening  I suggest an audiobook as well since this is a lot of content  Whisper sync works as a charm   A friend tried to get me to read this book over a decade ago and I didn t because I thought it was about manipulating people  I read it about three months ago and I couldn t have been more wrong  It s a very basic handbook about relationships  especially in business  and how to adapt to different personalities for successful relationships  Tons of great information  ktb  kthr mn ry     SHyH  nWa bh b D lnSy H lWty m  dt tufydn fy  yWmn hdhh w lknWh ktb mfyd w qyWm l

concepts it espouses  Anyone who is in a sales or management position should read this book  It is the foundation for virtually every self help book that came after it  I love it because it doesn t read like a sales management book  It isn t about a bunch of sales tricks to get people to buy from you  It really is about how if you treat people with respect and live an honest life you will reap enormous rewards not just in business but in life  It is so easy to read and is filled with interesting stories illustrating the points the author is making  Many of the stories are from the life of people like Benjamin Franklin  Abraham Lincoln  Mark Twain  John D Rockefeller  Theodore Roosevelt  Gandhi  and just average people who have used the suggestions in this book to improve their life  If I could convince people to read just one self help book in their life  this is the one I would pick  Love this book  I have read it many times   ktab ray   bkl ma tHmlh lklm  mn m n  qr th  dyda lkn fy kl mr  Hs bshwq kbr lhdha lktab  I don t think I need to recommend this book  because the title itself lures people to read it   Although this isn t a book I d read by choice  my dad had me read it  I loved the many quotes and ideas on how to become better in life  I d honestly recommend this one to anyone ages 14 and up  What a book    It teaches you how to deal with people and how to make them on your side   I heard it through a librivox recording The principles are timeless and will be an eyeopener for everyone  The fact that this is a best seller across generations  is a great testimony for the book  format  case studies and the principles It baffles me  as to why teachers  universities  colleges  schools do not include this as an essential reading before letting students go out to step into the corporate world  This is the best education a teacher parent can give their wards Dont miss reading this  Great book  Everything makes so much sense  but it s hardly ever conscious in people s thoughts And the reason why I read so many self help interpersonal relation books is usually required for my classes   This is one of the first self help development books I ve read and still one of the best  Extremely inspirational and well written  Dale Carnegie is a very likable man and this book is practically a bible for self development gurus  There is no  secrets  or magic things  Just about how to be more polite and caring  Must read for everybody and especially for those who feels alone can find it here https   www facebook com DaleCarnegie    An Amazing book  Its easy to understand What a solid book  All optimistic and positive  I love that it was written almost 80 years ago and that the principles and lessons are just as clear and valid as today  That s how you know it s True Valid  When it stands the Test Of Time  The only part I struggled with is when he discussed letting people  save face   I hate that stupid phrase by the way  even when you know they re wrong  I have mixed feelings about that  I think it s good to not embarrass someone in public but sometimes people need to know they are wrong  Otherwise they ll go their whole lives not knowing just because someone tiptoed around their feelings  He mentioned the way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it  Arguments are necessary at times  Perhaps this was the part I need to go back and re listen to since I struggle with it the most  Now that I read this book  I m going to have 100 kids so I can have 100 friends and no one can say no to being my friend   Instant classic wort reapeated reading once every year It just has that   old timey   sensibility that seems lost nowadays If you want to try to experience a little light  feel good nonfiction I can not recommend this book any more  I ve gone back to my copy of Dale Carnegie s book more than a few times and I never fail to learn something from it  The book is chock full of useful advice about how to deal with people in the real world If you re a nerd wondering why you re so often misunderstood and have trouble convincing people of your ideas  you need to read this book  Easy to see why it s such a classic  This was a well researched  well written book  The principles are easily put forward and the logic is easy to follow  I found it very fun to read  well  listen to anyways     Thanks audible    I think I m going to have to follow up with the audio version and get a printed copy I can peruse and mark up   Great book that shows how someone can have a better relationship with others and successfully influence others  Maybe the most important book I ve read in my life  Teaches how to be more of an effective communicator and leader Great  practical  helpful  read  On my list of books I think everyone should read  This is a fantastic book  I learned so many new things that can help me become a better person  Not that I m not one already HAHAHA jokes  Great book to read and definitely a re read type of book  I ve implemented a lot of the techniques and can visibly see my life changing for the better  Fundamental reading for anyone with less than perfect  people skills   While most of the suggestions individually sound like something you should already know  the exemplification and structure of the book makes the  rules  crystal clear  Super needful and super interesting book for those people who try to succeed in this Life   This book provides clear principles that you should repeatedly read over and practice until they become habitual and a part of your life  I highly recommend it  What a trailblazing book  For Dale Carnegie to put these principles on paper during the early part of the century was a testament to his insight  The issues around human relations continue and this book shows how important it is to give thought to how we interact in the world It s another book that I keep close by to revisit from time to time  Everyone should read this book  especially if you work in account client management This book could be called How to remember how to be a good person  I realize the title does sound a little like the book is intended to teach you how to manipulate people and get what you want  But in reality  reading this will make you think deeply about how to take care of people and be gracious  And as a benefit  you will have made friends and influenced people  It s a short  quick read don t be turned off by the copyright haha  It is still just as applicable   very good How to Win Friends and Influence People teaches people how to make others like them  and gives tips on how you can be a leader among others in your job or class  It gives real life examples of how choice of words and body language can change how tough conversations and meetings end  and gives different approaches of solving problems  It can help people of all ages with everyday situations they struggle to handle  and give young people important life lessons that can get them on the right path in life  I would recommend this book to a friend because it gives tips on how to treat others well  and it can bring out positive change to his her environment if the techniques are applied properly  It is a highly rated book that can always help you at whatever age you are  and it is a very quick read  It definitely inspires you to read more books that give life tips and teaches you that your cup is never full T J  Grade 10CLPK Young Adult Readers Advisory Board Member Saya sebetulnya dulu suka sebel kalo liat buku buku self help atau self improvement  tapi setelah ketemu buku ini pandangan saya berubah  Buku ini bukan saya beli  Entah gimana buku ini ada di rumah kontrakan saya jaman kuliah dulu  Dicuekin  dianggap gak penting  Tapi begitu mulai baca  ternyata sulit berhenti Buku ini  yang saya punya edisi terjemahan bahasa Indonesia   adalah hasil perahan pengalaman hidup dan pengalaman berbisnis dari penulisnya  Saking hebatnya dia sebagai motivator nama Carnegie bahkan mendunia lewat kursus kursusnya  Saking hebatnya buku ini  kalau tak salah buku ini juga jadi kitab pegangannya para pelaku bisnis MLM Kalau pepatah bilang  pengalaman adalah guru yang paling baik   maka buat saya  pengalaman orang lain adalah guru yang lebih baik lagi   Kenapa  Karena orang yang menulis pengalamannya sudah berbaik hati mau mengajak orang menghindari kesalahan yang sama  Buat apa dia berbuat begitu  Agar orang lain jauh lebih berkembang tanpa mengulang kesalahan kesalahan yang sama  Saya gak akan bocorin isi bukunya  Tapi yang pasti  si penulis menunjukkan satu kebenaran yang tak berubah hingga hari ini  Yaitu  bisnis apapun adalah perkara bagaimana kita memahami hubungan antar manusia  Seorang pebisnis tangguh adalah seorang pembelajar unggul tentang manusia  Memahami dirinya dan memahami orang lain  Keahlian itulah yang akan terlihat dalam komunikasi  bicara dan dalam bernegosiasi dengan lain Buku ini saya anjurkan dibaca oleh siapapun  umur berapapun dengan bisnis apapun  If you want to know how to win someone s respect  or convince them to your way of thinking  this is the book I would recommend  Carnegie has some very interesting  not to mention useful  theories about human behaivior   VERY cool book   Written nearly eighty years ago and still so relevant  This book has become more pertinent than ever  In a culture in which snark rules  it is good to have a wise and benevolent voice setting forth principles of personal respect and practical courtesy  Although there are a few devices Carnegie suggests using  he also tells the reader to be genuinely interested in other people  to provide honest appreciation  to practice sincere friendliness and also to do tough things like readily admit mistakes  Read the book Carnegie wrote  not the one he is often presumed to have written   This is a classic book that I hope EVERYONE reads  It seems like common sense  but so many people do not follow these principles  The world would be a much kinder and pleasant place if everyone would follow the principles that Carnegie discusses in this book  Everyone should read this book  It helps you understand human nature  My dad walked in  turned the light on in my dim room  barked  Don t read without your light on   threw this book on my bed and said   Read this one   Okay  Still five stars to me  This is an amazing book  It s broken down into principles  and they are very easy to understand  One thing about this book though  Read it slowly and apply the concepts in your daily interactions  Don t rush through the book  Take your time and make sure you understand and apply the principles  Personally  the principles work like a charm  Probably  the best human relations behavior book I have read  so far    Just read it  and apply this principles in your life  You will be pleased  Really  just read it  I would recommend it to ANYONE  by far the greatest wisdom and life lesson I have acquired through a book  I really recommend this to everyone     I ve read a few times    Recently re read and it is a great as ever Took lots of notes  I kept this book close a long time  if I had a minute a read a concept  now is seems like just plain common sense  but if you don t know these principes  you have to work on them  This book should be in every elementary classroom  its the fundamentals of how to communicate with other people  The audio version is not nearly as good  The speaker does not arouse excitement or eagerness in me  I know I shouldn t criticize  condemn or complain  but this guy is awful  He has no freaking up tone  He completely lacks the sense of playful rascal sense that Carnegie s original text holds  Although he has a sophisticated voice  his vocal range is not suited to this book  Don t bother with the audio book  go for the paperback  it ll be one of the best investments in your life I ve loved this book ever since I was 10  and find that reading it every couple of years helps keep me sharp  and stay up top  It s amazing what you can forget in a few months  or even mere moments  Every time you read it  it gives you something   This book was very good and insightful  it s just too bad that the title makes it sound like you are desperate or trying to take over the world if you re reading it  Makes it awkward to recommend this is a great friend winning book  After reading this book  it has give me a better understanding of how people behave and how to engage with them effectively  I now look forward to having intelligent conversations with some people  This book can help with building stronger relationships and motivational techniques  something that is really necessary in today s day and age  But ultimately it can aid in the process of getting the best out of people   Never old fashioned  You always can learn from this book no matter how old  mature you are  What I observed from this book is that the truths stated within are also the truth within other  self help  books   hence it is quite appropriate to call this one the  original  Though I had my frustrations in reading this  owing that the book clearly suggested you read each other TWICE  then meditate upon them before moving on to the next chapter   I found that the morals and lessons does quite stick when read according to the rules stated in the preface Other self help books can be regarded as further readings  But  How to Win Friends   Influence People  should really be on top of anybody s list who wanted to change their lives and make a difference   This has to be one of my favorites  although difficult to read  Re reading every chapter was a tough task but totally worth it with all of the wonderful information on how to interact with others  The best course of human relationsReally great book to read  Everybody should read this  It will change your social life for ever  I totally recommend it  Wow  I don t read many books but this was amazing  I ll have to re read it very soon because t was that good  It is filled with theories but also examples of implementation of the theories and ideasTop book Timeless classic by Dale Carnegie  Carnegie studied Lincoln  Roosevelt  Charles Schwab and many others and this book has a number of great examples of positive human relations on not criticizing  talking about your own mistakes first  spurring others onto success  This book will stay on my shelves forever  I wish I had had it earlier in life  I now know how my husband is the calm  wonderfully awesome man I have admired for years   he read this book long ago  and I will reread this every few months for the rest of my life   Nice Book turn the thinking     Communication is the best attractive art  And this art is a touching feel   For details http   bit ly 23ngEu9 And re read and will eventually read again    Dale Carnegie s well known book is by far the best business book I have ever read  Possibly the best book overall I have ever read  Carnegie was born in to poverty and made a tremendous living lecturing on self improvement  He believed that the best way to change other people s behavior is by changing your own reaction to them  The publishing of this book represents his crowning achievement in life  and outlines his learned principles for accomplishing success  You simply can t come out of reading this book with anything but a positive  sunny outlook on life  If you read this and discover you embody just a quarter of the principles he describes  you are already a marvelous individual  This book reminds us what it truly means to be a good person striving always for the ideal  the best  in ourselves  Now  if you ll excuse me  I think I ll pick it up for a re read  Written in the 1930 s  One of the best  informative books I ve ever read  Get your thought processes turned around for the better   I love this book  well worth reading  the stories are just the best  One of the most amazing books i have ever read totally recommended I ve read this book several times   applying Christ s teachings to living   good for all generations and a must read for everyone  It is a really nice book  because i read it twice  P  It teaches you how to be kind to people even though youare completely different  Donna Dale Carnegie has a lot of information and knows how to explain well  She puts examples of what girls have gone through in real life  there is a reality check  and the thing that i like the most is that she is explaining it as if she is talking to you in real life   A must read for everyone  Amazing book  So well written  Perfect examples  Timeless   I began listening to this book primarily to see what all the hubbub was about  It had received recommendation after recommendation and I honestly had a hard time believing it was that great having looked at summaries  That was the biggest mistake  If you read the summary of this book and the listing of the principles you will assume everything in this is obvious and say  well duh   Unfortunately it is the same as being given a bunch of math formulas and saying  well duh that s how the basic structure of the universe works   Until you see some examples  have them spelled out for you  and hear stories of their creative application you can t appreciate the immense value they have  The topics Dale Carnegie covers offer a lifetime of wisdom in interacting with other human beings   I regret why didn t I read this book years before    The essence of the book is great  even though it was written over 80 years ago we haven t change that much  The bad the book has a strong bias towards chauvinism   I can t begin to tell you how useful this book has been to me  I read it long ago  the message stayed with me  and has helped me so much in my life ever after  A must read for anyone struggling to get along  Good Book  This book is surprisingly current for something written 75 years ago  The advice is so simple and so obvious that you can t help but wonder why people even need to read it  and yet I felt like I learned something and find myself mentally checking the things I m writing to others against Dale s rules  To sum it up the advice from the book in a few words  be genuinely interested in other people and appeal to their interests  not your own   What an excellent book  The principles are very applicable to any job situation  or really any interaction with humans  If I had to say a negative I would definitely say it is dated  and many of the examples he gives to illustrate his points are historically based  many during the Lincoln days   He frequently cites military leaders and presidents  This did get a little monotonous by the end  I definitely think anyone could benefit from the advice in this book  It will be a book you will want to have on your shelf to consult before any type of confrontation   This book is great    It basically explains that the keys to good relationships are appreciation  tolerance  listening to others  and a positive attitude  Prochetokh ia na 14 godini  V rshi rabota    If you are looking for something to remind you what a terrible  self absorbed asshole you are  this is a great read  Helpful since I m far from socially adept  This is a classic that everyone should read  Seriously  This is a great book  a great read for anyone  this book should be on everyone s shelf  I have read it at least 6 times  WowIt helped me to improve my relationship with my friends and parents  It also gave me a good understanding of other s point of view  A TOTAL WINNERWhat can I add about one of the books most ever read after the Bible in a simple review   Well  I think that Dale Carnegie found a practical application of the Ancient Jewish Principles encompassed in the  Ethics of the Fathers  and in the Jewish Torah itself altogether  and this is one of the reasons why the book became so successful  it is backed by four thousand years old wisdom  the time mankind took to evolve into a civilization During the 20th century  Dale Carnegie got to the same conclusion that  King Solomon  the wisest of the Jewish Sages  had reached almost three thousand years ago     vanity of vanities  all is vanity    I can also add  that the first time I took myself to apply the principles detailed by Carnegie to solve a problem  the people I was negotiating with not only expressed their total satisfaction for the solution I had found  they also congratulated me  and  frankly  I did not expect that reaction And then  for the first time  I realized that knowing how to deal with people is as important in life as having the best education one can afford  If you have finished college and thought you have graduated  first read this book  I can assure you that your life will change for the better  At first I was skeptical to buy this book   How to Win Friends   Honestly felt like I was going to look like a loser buying this book  but I have to say  I am extremely glad that I picked up this book and far from feeling like a loser  The concepts in this book are entirely true  All these small things we could do that would improve our relationships with the people around us Yet we tend to ignore them and take things for granted  Especially when they re obvious  For an example  to smile and appreciate others   SOME SPOILER Some of you might be unwilling to buy this book  maybe cause you might think it is a scam  Well I can assure you that it is not  from my personal experience through the principles that is contained in this book Heres a little story A week ago before I finished this book  I was reading it during a religion discussion class  The sister told me to put the book down 3 times and wanted to see me after the class  We spoke what  was wrong with me   and I just defended my self saying   Time is precious  and I rather use it being productive and learning something valuable    We weren t even talking about anything during that class  Barely even talked about religion    In the book  principle 2 states  Show respect for the other person s opinions  Never say   You re Wrong  If you do you have struck a direct blow at their intelligence  judgement  pride and self respect  And that s what happened when she asked  What was wrong with me  and I was quick to defend myself  She then went onto give me advice since I want to be entrepreneur high recommend this book if you want to become one as well  and said  each person is your customer and you must listen  I told her thank you and that I honestly did learn a lesson from what she is said  As I went on to read the next chapter of the book was Principle 2  Give honest and sincere appreciation   Just like I had done to the sister  And her response was  Really    With a big smile on her face  You could tell she felt  important   Which in the book is one humans most desirable feelings to feel  Then the next day I continued reading the book   I got to part 2 of the book   And I was shocked to see Principle 4 which states  Be a good listener   I was like wow that s what sister had told me to do  So all Im trying to point out is that  each day you can find principles of this book being applied to our daily lives and relationships without us noticing And one more thing  Principle 8  Try honestly to see things from the other s persons point of view  I feel like this is far the most important principle of them all  if not  one of them  My dad tells me all the time when I get into fights with my mom him  that I have to look from their point of view  Either though I don t like it  it is true  It is a hard thing to do  since human nature is quick to judge  If only we could refrain from judging  and just step back and become more open minded  Maybe then  the world might be a better place Oh and if you came this far in my review  this is my first book review I ever written  So for me to write this review  this book must be worth it  Life changing for me as a teenager  again as adult  Largely anecdotal  but simple  powerful ideas  I m embarrassed by how much of this stuff I d never actually thought about hard enough to understand up until now   This books holds true even now   will for coming time  Really wonderful insights on developing good relations  This book is even a must read for people in hospitality industry  Dale Carneige shines throughout  this will change your whole perspective to interacting with people everyday  Fantastic resource to help remind you how kindness and respect improves one s relationships and sense of well being  Sounds obvious   but most of us could use this book as a reminder of how to best practice these things  There is nothing in this book that you probably haven t heard before  but it s great to have them all in one location  It s a good read  It was very motivational  I would read this one again in the future it s a classic bc you can apply the same principals today  nuggets of practical wisdom A commonsense guide to human relations  Hint  have tact and listen  I was deciding whether I d read this book and a starkly different book  Vagabonding by Rolf Potts  this December  Eventually  after careful deliberations  I settled on Vagabonding However  the very first paragraph of Vagabonding details the narrator  floating down a river in Thailand  desperate for a read  He stumbled upon a setting that had exactly one English book  How To Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie  The narrator continues on to tell his readers on how this book affects him and inspires him to write the book I was currently reading I took it as a sign I find myself sometimes aggravating friends  and oftentimes aggravating coworkers when making suggestions and expressing my desires for their and my own productivity  I expected there were ways to express myself without upsetting people  and figured that this book could give me a baseline for contorting myself in these environments It did  This book tells you what you should have been taught in elementary school  While the book doesn t tell you anything you don t know  it tells you things explicitly in ways you may have not considered  Each principle includes multiple examples of how they have helped different people in home life  work life  and life altogether  It was a fun practice to study each chapter each day and ensure that I followed the principles dictated in that chapter to  win  some friends and  influence  some people  Again  this is basic information  and it shouldn t be hard to consciously observe the suggestions in this bookI can see the potential for the principles in this book to lead to manipulation  but I doubt it could be used for truly malicious purposes  All in all  this book is very very good  and makes my must read books as far as self help books go  This book gave me more awareness  You never know what someone is going through and something as simple as a smile can make them feel better  Even when i am feeling down and out i think about the book and try not to let that take control of me or the people around me  any situation you are in and you do not like     you can make it better or cry about it like a little ho    enjoy life  One of the best books on how to communicate with purpose  A must have for your personal library   Very nice book  A lot of suggestions in this book are common sense but we all fail to use them  This book reminds and suggests to Smile  Stay Humble and Accept your mistakes  Overall  the first 3 sections are really good but the last one gets a bit boring  at least that s what I think   the last section could have been better Overall  I really suggest this book    a Must read This is a great book  I ve learned so many things from it  I have been praising people and made so many more friends since I read this  and I m reading it again  wahoo  This is a real  Duh  book  No magical formulas  or anything about how to take advantage of people but really just common sense about how to treat people  But  sometimes we really need this as a refresher  i learned a lot about social skills from this book and all of the lessons are applicable in daily life  All time classic  Must read for anyone  Great book for living  life and success  I just started reading this because a friend of mine was telling me that everyone should own a copy  I have only been reading this for two days  and already I am in agreement with her  It s definitely a book that you will read over and over again  a book that will influence you and the rest of your life  one of the BEST  It helps me alot    Great guide for daily diplomacy  Does a good job of re framing interactions  with relatable examples  to highlight what a difference a simple change of perspective can make when working with others toward a goal  Highly recommend  This is one of those books that can completely change the way you think about the world around you  the people in it  and how you interact with them   This book is a classic for a reason  Although the writing may not stand the test of time  it s not terrible  just a little stilted by today s standard   the tenets still hold true  There s no earth shattering advice in this book  Everything in it is intuitive when we regard the advice on how we want others to treat us  But it s in the application of applying the advice to others that we all benefit from being reminded of  It s uncommon common sense  and worth reading and re reading   The best book about human relation  still relevant up till now  This is a must read for everyone   I tested the practices suggested in the book as I read it and the results are incredible  I ll be reading this 2X a year forever  or a good while at least  Highly  highly  highly recommend  A must read book for entrepreneurs  It will not only motivate you to be better among people  but also help you improve yourself  From creating wonderful things to making sales and influencing customers to buy products  this book covers them all  Fantastic  Application will help in all aspects of life  A must read book for those who want to reach the top  and stay there  Lots of good advice  if not a bit dated examples  Seriously though  you can get past that  Definitely a good book for anyone who wants to improve their ability to function in public or with people   Dale Carnegie menciptakan formula yang mengesankan untuk menciptakan hubungan yang lebih baik antar manusia  Salah satu pelajaran yang paling saya ingat   Satu satunya cara untuk memenangkan perdebatan adalah menghindarinya  great bookThis book is a must read for everyone  Although there are many chapters that are common sense  this book serves as a great reminder for all   fine book  adds to your way of tackling difficult problems of real life into easy way  also defines the ways to tackle people influentiallyI liked it  Don t worry  it s not a manipulative book  This is a book about manners  The world  our country and our homes would be much better places if we all just kept this book on our night tables These bits of wisdom are things we should have learned at home and school but our laziness  coolness  competitiveness  rebellions and snarky ways  just got in the way If you have children and you want to give them practical and timeless wisdom about good social skills that will last them a lifetime  from an expert who really understands why we haven t achieved peace and prosperity  love and comfort in the world   then share this book of age old wisdom from a timeless and respected author  If you re an employee  family member or friend   this book will help you too  I recommend this book for anyone especially in business and attend networking functions   Such simple and fundamental information that has held true over the test of time  This should be a must have in all personal libraries   any one can criticize  condemn and complain but it takes character and self control to be understanding and forgiving  if there s any one secret of success it lies in the ability to get the other person s point of view and see things from that person s angle as well as from your own  Loved the real life  solid advice  Could be dry  but the quality was so worth it  With one of the most pretentious and seemingly manipulative titles  and an even more pretentious introduction  I was a bit off put in the beginning with How to Win Friends and Influence People  however  knowing its reputation I trudged on  and I am glad I did I think the content of this book is crucial to know  as it deals with probably what is of the utmost importance in our world  people  If a book of the  self help  genre doesn t appeal to you  let me say that nearly everything within this book can be summed up in two words  be nice  Almost all the tips and examples of how to deal with people are truly common sense  yet it s still eye opening as you reflect on how simple and powerful the easiest of gestures can be It s interesting to think how universal these ideas are  and how they truly can stand the test of time  I m curious if Carnegie knew back in 1936 when How to Win Friends and Influence People was first published the impact it would have  and if he knew it would still be read a great deal more than seventy years later  While you have most likely heard of each of the pieces of advice at least once in your life  the elaboration and use of historical examples  as well as Carnegie s  brash and breezy  style along with his 1930 s slang keeps the entire experience intriguing and captivating  It s easy to see the effect each and every one of his tips has on people  and it s a book that you can get the most out of with practice of the tips and observation of the results It s hard to nitpick a book that s both entertaining and interesting  and has an underlying message of just being kind  considerate  and thoughtful  While it did not reveal to me anything mind blowing or shocking  it served as a reminder of how to properly interact with others and gave me a heightened sense of social awareness  and I m sure my life will be all the better for it  I m also sure I ll be reading this again more than once in the years to come  Absolutely great book and more important still relevant In this book you will read about how to handle people communication effectively and make more out of it  lktb ldhy GyWr Hyty    Amazing book  Everyone should read it  My college age daughter has read this every year for the last 10 yrs and says it has made a big difference in her life This has been one of the all  time bestsellers for the past 60 yrs and there is a good reason for that  it is so easy to live simply and happily contented In one word   Amazing  This book changed my life  This book is one of those you need to read over and over again   Loved this book  Nothing in here is truly groundbreaking   it s all stuff I ve heard before   but the way he puts it together is really inspiring  Made me think long and hard about how I act toward other people   ktb mmt  wlkn ltrjm  knt D yf  fy b D lmwDy sykwn  jml lw kn ktbh mslm wd Wmh bb D layt wl Hdyth Very good book  It is a lot of common sense when you read it  but isn t something you necessarily think of during the moment  It s one of the best personal development books I have read  Incredible book  Simply put  but so richly backed with examples  Particularly  loved how the author explained the anatomy of certain essentials  the words  yes    no    praise    flattery   Most importantly how it is vital to step into other person s shoes  Elementary  we so often forget about that trivia Title doesn t do the book justice  Step by step guide to changing your paradigm and becoming a more influential person in all your daily roles both personal and work related I learned a lot from this book  Although some of it is common sense and I already knew it s good to hear a refresher course on it and remember why we treat people with respect and kindness and to be interested in others and not so stuck on ourselves  This is a must read for my kids too  My 17 year old read it last week now on to my 15 year old  Read Nov 1  2011Sep 20th  2015 A must read unless you don t wanna deal with people  I got my hands on my grandfathers copy of this book published in 1936  I enjoyed it  the author has great advice if you want people to like you  Congrats to those who can do it  This book was written almost seventy years ago and still the principles and strategies that are laid forth for enhancing people skills are spot on  If reading this book doesn t help you deal with people than you have no hope   I never fathomed sitcom  The Nanny  believable until I read this      I am reading a fabulous book I think I must tell you what this book I want more people can read it because you must like it I recommend the book How to make friends and influence people sincerely And this book was translated to many main languages in

and easily   Become genuinely interested in other people etc  After read this book we can get many help from it It also can make our life get better even we can feel more happy than past So I think this is a self educational book  There are many parts in this book they all about how to change our self to influence the people that we can touch  I think the author do well on come up with many advice and used many examples to show how the advises worked Some advice even include two or three instance to connect it In my opinion I cannot come up with any place can be better this is a perfect book At the same time this book must be compelling and page turner When you read first chapter you must want to read next chapter until you finish this book Because this book can bring qualitative help for readers  I suggest the people who feel not happy everyday or always feel under much pressure really should read this book I swear you can be better by this book In fact not only the people I mentioned above but also everybody should be potential person  To sum up this is a self education book when we read this book we can get a lot of help from it Everybody should read it to improve the quality of our life   must read for anyone This book makes a bold promise to the reader It proclaims itself to be   The Only Book You Need to Lead You to Success  Although skeptics may reject this idea immediately  doing so would be a major mistake Carnegie s advice is repeatedly proven to be as good as gold  through the use of anecdotes   examples  Chapters build on each other by focusing on one skill set at a time  By applying the principles outlined in each chapter  the value of this book will be engraved in one s mind  Repetition is used sparingly to reference previous material  Although some examples may seem miraculous  by simply following this book s advice remarkable changes will appear in your life Like water in a barren desert  this book is able to give life to whoever finds it Dale Carnegie s brilliant mind brings soul to his inspiring writing  it is as if he were sitting beside the reader  guiding them through every page  Similar to a loving father  his tone is compassionate yet authoritative  My recommendation is for any prospective reader whom selects this book  to follow Carnegie s advice without delay  Persisting in their efforts until they too become a master of communication  This book is AWESOME  This is a great read for anyone who is looking to brush up on their human relations skills  To see my full review  click here  http   www associatedcontent com arti    I really liked this book and it was interesting  It taught me a lot about how to make more friends and make less enemies  Chapter 1 was my favourite along with  chapter 4  chapter 7 and the last chapter  It taught me to get along with my peers  not act bossy around people  always smile and say hi and never bully people   Dale Carnegie wasn t fazed by the dire economic times in 1937 when he published How To Win fiends and Influence People  In the worst of times his gem became a run away best seller and continues to be valuable tool for all of us today  Why  Carnegie reveals to you basic truths in plain language that show you how to appeal to people and win their confidence  Don t be put off by the fact that it was published 76 plus years ago  Assign it as reading for all the young students and adults in your family   One of the best books I have read so far  A must read self help book   if I have to choose one book that has influenced and changed my life and my point of view to others  then unquestionably this book is the one I heard about this  bible  so many times  people quoted this book  but I never had interest to read it until my father gave me an old copy of this book  and as I read it  I couldn t put it down till I got into the last page  What I like most about this book is the way Carniegie elaborated his main points and sub points with stories  not just common stories but very interesting stories from AL capone  Lincoln  and many more I found that those lessons that I had learned from this book is timeless and priceless  somehow I just want to read it again and again  and still I learn a new insight from it  And the one thing that I don t like about this book is the title       How to Win friends and Influence people    well  if this book is launched during modern days  most likely people will misjudge it as a MLM guidance book    Unfortunate title for such an amazing book  It is a compilation of Dale Carnegie s collection of books on dealing with people  I had a friend growing up who must have read this in her youth because she has always been an amazing communicator  showing intense interest in others  therefore  making her well loved by those she has taken such interest in  Highly recommended on everyone s bookshelf  To be perfectly honest I can t rememeber a LOT of this book  In the past I ve read through it

the timeless classics ever   Fantastic   This books includes very useful tips on how to be a better person  The tittle makes it sounds self serving and shallow  but in truth I feel that by applying some of the principals not only can I do better professionally  but I feel I can be better as a husband  father  and friend as well  I plan on re reading this often  I thought it was one of the best way for people to learn how to improve their human communication  It gave many example for people to know how to win friends and influence people  Should be required in high school reading  Basic people skills that are never taught   I should have read this ages ago  I need to re read it again  and again  and again  and      one of books that shape my life EVERYONE should read this  It s a

problems  Everyone should read it  The messages are timeless  Dale Carnegie is an excellent teacher  and writes in a very straightforward manner  He uses clear examples  and language that is motivating A must read for anyone looking to understand the dynamics of human interaction  Nice quick read packed with valuable people management insights  I would recommend it to anyone in a leadership position as well as anyone that is having difficulties relating to others  This is one of the best books I have ever read  It has helped me to be a more confident person in my every day life  This book pushes forwards a  results driven   other focused  manner of dealing with people  That will lead to better friendships  greater business success  and overall happiness It contains a series of practical principles to deal with people  Each of which is supported by anecdotal evidence that is convincing  though of course anecdotal evidence is not good evidence   However  further evidence can be gained simply by using these principles yourself and seeing the immediate changes More then a series of practical principles  Carnegie shows you how your assumptions about others and your day to day mannerisms are misinformed  You will learn how if you re goal is to have  results  and not some childish pleasure of  venting  then it is much better to not argue  but push forward your ideas in other ways A sneak peak is the high level idea that damaging a person s self perspective or arguing directly against their beliefs is as harmful and rude as physically punching them  And most importantly  the single best take away  years spent trying to charm people is far less effective then simply taking a genuine interest in other people  Very helpful  practical book on relationships and working successfully with people  I ll be recommending it to my kids in their teens  One of the best books in print  A must read for any person looking to develop themselvs  This is a great book It should be read again and again as it gives positive tips to increase your personality and perception about people and yourself  Amazing book on human relations and leadership  Every

mit unterschiedlichsten Menschen umzugehen sollte Dale Carnegie lesen  Praktische Tipps zum Umgang mit anderen und mit sich selbst  grossartiges Buch  Lesen  nochmal lesen  weglegen und was anderes lesen  wieder von vorne mit Carnegie anfangen    Its a life changing book  personally for me Things are beautifully described with ample examples portraying vivid scenarios Things starts from being polite and goes all the way to inducing rational thing in yourself and others I would recommend it all my friends and family to read it and shape their prospective to live a better and more effective life  This book changed my life  literally  I was never a  self help  reader  but I read this book at a key point in my career where I needed to gain perspective on how to work and manage other people  It truly changed my perspective on how to deal with my day to day life   Accept it  leave it  or change it   I try to read this one each year  as I always do a little better with some principle each time  It s one of my favorites to help me back up and remember to see things thru others  perspectives  A very fruitful book for anyone  really  Many advice on how to communicate with people   This is one of those books where you know every section like the back of your hand but are compelled to retread once a year just to re energize yourself for whatever you do  If your in sales or just want to get further in your career this book should be in your library with well worn pages and a cover falling off  The single most effective book that led to great change in my life  This is a great book and helped me to rethink and analyze situations in the past that I could have handled differently  and most importantly  what to do now  A book about empathy and caring about others  As Professor Dumbledore says  kindness is  a trait people never fail to undervalue    This book was phenomenal     I did what the book suggested and read each chapter twice highlighting key points  I loved the principles and summaries that the book provided  The application of each principle is outstanding  Once you start reading it seems like it just works  I will be reading this again and I recommend everyone to read this as well  simple facts with simple acts   needs practice and repetitive readings though   I must have read this book 3 times  This is not just the stereotypical book for business professionals  it works for everyone  He has list of very basic common sense rules that just click when dealing with people    How to Win Friends and Influence People  is one of those books that I was a fool for having not read earlier in life  I had assumed the title meant  how to manipulate people   How foolish I was  This book is a masterful guide in how to communicate with tact  courtesy and respect   and thereby building others up along with solving the  problem  you might have with that person  This is a book that the current generation needs to read  the generation that is so quick to point out faults by every review or comment  Read this  my fellow fool  and you will be the better for it   3  3  3 The best self development book i ve ever read so far   Lots of things to learn from this book    I wrote this review some two years ago  perhaps a little more  Since then  it has attracted the unbelievable number of soi disant negative or unhelpful votes of 152  June 2004  and now  in November 2007  the count is 10 Useful and only 102 Not Useful   stranger and stranger    I suppose it is the work of one person  as one scarcely imagines there are so many people out there who would care enough about this particular work  or about this particular writer   me   Nevertheless it is a fascinating statistic and it adds a little more colour to our understanding of a world which is already malfunctioning in numerous other ways Here s the original review I guess if Dale Carnegie was writing today  he would be quite a star author  since the subject which he helped to develop has become one of the most popular of all those to be found on bookshop shelves  How surprising is it then  to consider that Carnegie had such tremendous success in an epoch where a great many people would have had difficulty just coming to terms with his ideas  let alone embracing them  It seems simplistic to say that most of Carnegie s text is just plain common sense  it certainly is that  His prose is also delivered in an unequivocal fashion  but with humour  He knows what he s talking about  and he knows probably  that you or me or the next guy is going to be sceptical anyway  So he just tells it like he sees it and hopes the reader will catch the vision  Since he really hasn t got a hobbyhorse to ride  we do catch the drift  at least the millions of copies sold suggest that we do   I believe if you read this book and don t have a thoroughly enjoyable time  as you straighten out a lot of your own thinking   then it will only be because you need to come back to it in two or perhaps five years time  In addition to the above  let me say that Carnegie is also a fine writer  which helps   It s a great book  for me it has five stars  the only thing is that in the final part I felt like it repeats the first parts  it could have been shorter and give you the same ideas  This is a must read book for all humans on the planet  And I recommend purchasing it so you can revisit the book yearly  It provides simple and practical advice based on common sense via elevated and highly entertaining prose   I read this book when I was a young teenager and it changed my life  Decades later  it is still affecting the way I deal with people  This book is so old but the knowledge is timeless  Dale Carnegie was a social genius  Provavelmente o melhor livro da minha vida Ja li  estou relendo e provavelmente o relerei por toda a minha vida  I don t know why it took me this long to read this book  There are a lot of common sense concepts that everyone should know but we often forget  I really want to print out the lists and hang them where I can see them everyday to beat them into my head  Excellent read  It is a masterpiece  I read long back but still strongly feel the book is relevant today in the era of Social media  computers  This book was written when people were not even aware of internet  computer but basic principles are still relevant to this age  Obviously  Dale Carnegie is the master at this    and I still refer back to many stories and examples in his book on how to treat people with the respect they deserve  Incredible read  Read this book for work  amazing  I think everyone would benefit from this one   An understanding of how to relate to any type of person  I used this book understand how to motivate people  Easy book     never quite finished it but I learned A LOT from it   A title like this could make a potential reader think one of two things  One is that they would not be caught dead reading a book as corny as this one sounds  Two is that they could not possibly afford to pass up a book that appears to contain so much value  I hope all of you think the latter when seeing this book on the shelf or on my site  How To Win Friends And Influence People is a classic  first written almost 70 years ago  This is as timeless as they come Two good friends of mine turned me onto this book years ago and for that I am quite grateful  The book does an excellent job of getting one to see everyday actions in a completely different light  The funny thing is that after reading this book you may find yourself thinking that you ve read it before  That is probably because you have been hearing these principles from your mother since before you can remember  My mother has been  and still is  an incredible teacher of how to act  how to treat  and how to most effectively deal with the people with whom I interact  She has been telling me these things for so long  When I was a child they did not have a chance of breaking through my rebellious shell  Thankfully that has since changed It is such a shame that it often takes the words of someone famously successful to drive a point home  After reading this book I had Carnegie to thank for reminding me of these principles  but more importantly my mother to thank for ingraining them  If these books serve as nothing more than reminders of what one has already learned  then so be it  They serve just as great a purpose in that respect as they would in teaching you them for the first time Let me give you an example of some of the principles that Carnegie brings to light  As I mentioned before  keep in mind that many are quite basic and common sense to most  Unfortunately common sense is not common practice Smile  That is one principle  Most of us hopefully smile everyday  but do we ever take the time to think about a smile and the incredible power and effect it has on others  A smile can often be the single deciding factor between a deal being made and being broken  Neither party may consciously recognize it but it is true  Think about the way it feels next time you smile at someone or how about the next time someone smiles at you  It is one of the most powerful split second actions in existence  We would be foolish not to take advantage of it Here s another principal  Try honestly to see things from the other person s point of view  How basic is that  Too often do we get caught up in the heat of a discussion or argument that we do not take the few seconds or minutes to try to see the discussion from our opponent s point of view  In fact it often becomes impossible once we get so emotionally involved in the argument  Next time you find yourself in a discussion with someone  try taking a moment to look at it through their eyes  You may be very surprised with what does and does not seem  obvious  from this person s vantage point  Use those discoveries in your discussion and you will likely be surprised by the positive result Another principal is   give the person a fine reputation to live up to   At first this may not seem like much  but have a look at it through this example  Someone in your office has a very important presentation to put together and present in the next few days  She needs help from someone in the office to make the workload manageable  You know you are confident with your presentation prep skills  She now confronts you and says   I saw the incredible presentation you put together last week and I have heard that you are the best in the office at this  I could really use your help with mine  Would you mind   Imagine the feeling of pride that hearing this would give you  You can bet that after hearing about your  reputation  you are going to be sure that you live up to it and help her to create an incredible presentation  A good reputation is something that every success conscious person wants to live up to in their life  Think about that next time you need help The final principal I want to mention is one that I feel has had the most powerful and positive effect on my life since reading it in this book  This principal is to always remember someone s name  This is one of the biggest problems in our society  I certainly used to be 100  guilty of it  I would introduce myself to someone and be so focused on what I said that I did not even give myself a chance to hear their name  Whatever technique you find that works  it is vitally important that you remember that person s name the first time you hear it  Few things feel better in this world than hearing your name  especially when it is from someone whom you did not expect to remember   One of the most powerful ways to build rapport with a person is to call him or her by their name right from the start  As I said earlier  it is often the small things that make the huge difference  Taking this one principal seriously and living it the rest of your life will undoubtedly have tremendous implications on your future success Carnegie starts out this book by recommending how it should be read  He tells the reader to read through it once  and then do so again while highlighting key portions  Then read through the key portions every month or so to make sure that you are constantly living these principals  I picked this book up a number of years ago and I have since read through it countless times  I made an outline of the key principals and am sure to read through that every few months  As Stephen Covey says   to know and not to do  is really not to know   These life changing principals will get you no where if you keep them locked up your mind  As with every other book that you read  you must make reality out of the knowledge you gain  It is that reality that will bring you your greatest success  Read  understand  live and apply every one of Dale Carnegie s fundamental principals and your success will be unbelievable  Start today  I thought that this book has a lasting message and that is that if you invest in people at some point that invest will pay off  Ina society where its all about me its good to read a tome written in the 60 s that speaks about caring and investing in others  I will read this book many more times to come  One of my favorite books and authors  This book really changed the way I interact with people  Its advice can be roughly summed up in one sentence  be geniunely interested in people  Despite the simplicity of its advice  it is still important to read  Through its advice and examples  readers can rediscover a skill that s mostly lost in these hurried times  listening  A book every person needs to read to learn how to deal with people better  Halfway through I book I got bored though  Read it many years ago  and Just read it again  picked up a few new points again  will come back to this masterpiece in a few years once again  I have read this book multiple times and believe it is a must read for anyone going to school  looking for a job  trying to advance their career  or just want to create stronger relationships with those they will meet throughout their life  Easy to read chapters  and very practical advice to becoming a more likeable person  Everyone should read this book How to Win Friends   Influence People is so timeless and valuable   even in the digital age and modern age of social media  Success is always going to boil down to having skill in dealing with people  I only wish I could have read it sooner   like in high school     Loved this book  I think one of my goals for 2016 might be to read more nonfiction books because I realized earlier this year that I m lacking there  This Dale Carnegie book is a classic  and I figured that if it s been around for this long  it s got to have some advice worth listening to  I thought the advice laid out here was quite sound and sensible  and it was refreshing to hear instinctual truths laid out in such a straight forward manner  The book is designed to provide advice on how to interact with people in order to get the answer that you want  The advice is accompanied by success stories to give you an idea about how to implement these values in your day to day life  I don t think readers will be particularly shocked by what Carnegie lays out  but I think much of the advice describes behaviors we don t always actively pursue  The value in Carnegie s book lies in its ability to make you take more purposeful action toward your goal  and it never hurts to have a reminder like that  Wow  A must read for anyone  really  It is so intelligently writen just like a novel  One of the best self help and personality development books I have ever read  I have seen the principles working  I highly recommend this book  Everyone should read this book  No need to reiterate what many others have said  Timeless    My favorite aspect of this book is its timelessness  The first edition written 3 4 of a century ago makes constant references to the ability of Lincoln  Roosevelt and other Presidents as the position requires more of a charismatic spark like no other in the modern world  Carnegie also writes about the teachings of Socrates and Aesop  Though thousands of years have passed  they ways to win friends and influence people has stayed the same  Still the StandardI read this book 25 years ago and read it again in 2015  It is surely one of the best books on influencing others ever written   Perfect explanation of common sense social interaction This book really helped me to understand how to make social interaction work It really changed my insight on relationships  at a moment of my life where I had many doubts about me and my interaction communication skills  It truly influenced me and following the author s piece of advice is already improving my everyday life  I would recommend it to anyone  This is a great book especially for anyone in sales  Another classic  I took the Dale Carnegie course for the first time in 1987 and it changed my life  After taking this class  I knew that I wanted to become a professional inspirational motivational speaker and be able to positively influence the world the way Dale Carnegie has done  This is a must read It is in the recommended reading section of my book  The Upside of Down Times  Discovering the Power of Gratitude which can be found here  http   amzn to NjNs06 This book is a life changer   It s a must read I will owe all my success to this book  Totally recommended  One of the best books outhere  Amazing  Great read  Everyone should read this  It s a classic  I m looking forward to reading this book  Altho I ve always been a people person  and find it easy to connect in ways that are meaningful for both myself and the other folks I connect with  I believe this book will take me to a new level  New to business  I know this will open new avenues and give me new tools  It comes highly recommended by Dani Johnson  who has set her own amazing standards of excellence in the business community  Great book  I m reading it again  for the third time   This is one of those books that never gets old   you could make it an annual event to read this book  Good Every human being should be required to read this book  I read it for a Dale Carnegie course I m taking  and although some parts of it are a bit cheesy  it s all still totally applicable all theses years after Dale Carnegie wrote it  This book gives pointers and life lessons that help you to communicate with other people  It tells about how you can more easily handle people  This helps you to become more sucessful and have better realtionships  It says that someone that wants to be recognized for thier achicvements needs to have a true interest in other people  When yout truly interested in the other person  the other person feels important and wanted  They are more likly to enjoy your company  It also explains how each person in this world has a need almost as strong as hunger and that is the need to feel important  by giving someone that you are feeling their needs and buliding them up This hasn t been made into a movie I really liked this book  It has helped me so much in my realtionships in others  It has given me knowledge that I will use for the rest of my life  I like how the author describes each subject  Dale Carnegie is also able to thrown in some humor with every concept which made the book eaisier to get through and quiet entertaining  This book is a guide to life  I think several people should be required to read this book at least once  I loved this book and recommend everyone specially introverts like me  I struggle in social parties and to have friends  I applied the teaching of this book in one of social parties  and I loved the results this book teaches us how to work with others and be nice  I truly believe my ability to effectively communicate and work with other people improved radically  Timeless advice  Fun to read  I read this book as a painfully shy teenager  I realized the simple truths of just looking people in the eye  smiling  and shaking their hand firmly for making a good first impression  Use someone s name to acknowledge that you remember them  When you treat people with respect and politeness  you can never go wrong  I moved back as an adult into the neighborhood where I had grown up  My mother s friends and our neighbors said to me   Do you know that you were different as a teenager  You were not the typical teenager  You looked me in the eyes when I spoke to you  You answered directly  and you were always polite   I credit this book for those compliments  Incredible    A man before his time with a message that has no bounds  The single most obvious and simple yet still fascinating insights from an author whom has truly stumbled upon some remarkable quirks of human interaction through his own experience  This allows him to very personally and very convincingly tell stories as examples of his points  His advice is very concise and eloquent  Many self help books leave you with a long list of things that in my opinion simply amount to  mental masterbation   that is to say feeling good about having gained much knowledge knowing that the knowledge in theory is actionable but is often too much far too much information that won t benefit the majority of readers as they won t know where to start  Dale Carnegie makes it very actionable and for that reason I have re read this book once a year every year for the past 3 years   An extra ordinary book  It is a must read for everyone   This is probably the most universally needed book ever written  Its an awesome book which tells one how to understand other s viewpoint and how we can approach what we want to say without getting in face of people  Giving options to people without making them sound that it s how we want it to be  Wow  Membuat saya lebih berhati hati dalam bersikap  FAVORITE BOOK  Very informative and has a lot of great points  This book has completely changed my life  I am in awe at the nature of human beings and how we are all the same today as 100 years ago  I m making Jakob read it and will definitely make my boys read it before college  Amazing  Everyone should read this book  Very good book worth reading  Lots of important lessons  This book changes the way you communicate with other people and how your react to difficult situations   This Book I read some twenty years ago  This was such a good book that altogether changed my behavior  This is a book that must be included in school course  This teaches the reader to behave and find success  This book impacted much on my life and relations  I followed this book almost all the time I gifted this book to several people during last twenty years  Surprising  none of them read and find its treasure   I read this about every year and am making my teens read it too  lol   Brilliant  I particularly love the  6 Ways to Make People Like You   Amazing how it has stood up from 1936  Still feels remarkably relevant   Inspiring  socialization makes us human and as there different characters on the stage of life  one need guidance in dealing with specific characters  in man s selfish nature  he is to be a little selfless to be accepted and vice versa OK  I know the title of this book is ridiculous  Honestly  I picked it up more with the expectation of laughing at it than actually getting something out of it Boy was I wrong The title of this book is by far the worst part  It was written in the 30s  so forgive it that  Once you get past the title  the principles that this book teaches are timeless and universal  at least  in my experience  Nothing in here will feel radically new to anyone who has had any sustained experience in dealing with people  I didn t learn anything  new  by reading this  HOWEVER  and this is a big  however    I absolutely needed to be explicitly reminded of the basic rules of how to deal with people in a way that benefits all and doesn t create animosity  Every day  my life is defined by thousands of small and big interactions with people  The choices I make in how to approach those interactions determine how I m seen  understood  and treated by others  I know this  and yet every day  I do and say things that go against what I know about human nature  Why Honestly  because it s difficult  It s tough to treat people with respect when they seem to demand ridicule and contempt  It s difficult to point out my own mistakes when someone else seems to have so many glaring ones themselves And yet   Carnegie is right  You can t win an argument  You won t get what you want by criticism  There s always a price to pay for negativity  If you want to win  positivity is the only long term way  And that s a lesson everyone can use Ignore the ridiculous title  read the book  and push yourself to apply these principles that absolutely govern how we are treated and perceived in our social world   It s very seldom that something  anything can live up to the hype it gets or reputation it has from people who like a certain thing  This book is one of the few things that lives up to every bit of praise that has ever been given to it  This book literally puts every action or reaction that one should have in any given situation in business  It fills you in on the importance of things that may seem like common sense  Everybody knows if you deal with the public it s good to smile  but this book tells you why  It gave me new insight into how important it is to learn and repeat peoples  names back to them  It tells you how important things like approbation are when criticizing someone  There are so many different tips and tools that there really is no way I could possibly list them all in this report  but needless to say  this is an invaluable book that I will be happy to reread on numerous occasions  nice book that put things into perpective for handeling people in the best way  I think the title of this book is somewhat misleading as the casual passerby in the bookshop may think it s only for people with no social ability whatsoever  I found this was quite the contrary  and rather a guide for anyone looking to improve their social skills in a variety of settings from friendship  relationships  and in the workplace  Despite having been written in the 1930s  the skills taught and examples shared by Carnegie are still very relevant   This is a timeless book   although this is a book for everyone  but if you are a manager   business owner or a sales person its a must read   this book will give you an idea on handling people   relations   prospective client   upset customers   juniors and giving you way to do thing which will make you win hearts  it will also open your eyes on many things which you did and thought them as right  it will tell you on your face on how wrong you were most of the examples used here are still relevant and you could connect to most of them happening to you in day to day life  so don t wait grab a copy Still holds true after all of these years  A must read for everyone  If more people followed the advice of this book  the world would be a much nicer place  Carnegie reinforced in me the need to show appreciation  sincerity  humility  and a positive attitude  It s prescriptions are less about controlling others and more about improving yourself This book is highly anecdotal  but when you re Dale Carnegie and have personally helped thousands of people  your anecdote can carry plenty of weight To me  there is more value in reading this book a second or third time than most books on sales or organizational management  So if you haven t read it once  what are you waiting for  A must read for anyone and everyone  Incredibly insightful into what it means to be human   why we act the way we act and how we can improve our interactions with others Un libro incredibile che aiuta ad aprire la mente e a vedere le cose sotto un altra prospettiva  Qualunque sia l ambito in cui si vogliono applicare i suoi principi  lavoro  famiglia  ecc     al fine di migliorare se stessi e le relazioni con gli altri  e in grado di trasmettere positivita e la sensazione che tutto sia possibile La grande qualita di questo libro lo posiziona indubbiamente tra i migliori libri di crescita personale  It is a really nice book  because i read it more than 4 times  P  It teaches you how to be kind to people even though youare completely different  Dale Carnegie has a lot of information and knows how to explain well  He tells about nobody thinks about you  you have to think about others inorder to make them to do your work  Excellent for marketing guys and everybody   Nothing to critique on this book  Definitely a must read on relationships  Business  family  love    All those strategies can be implemented in all the areas in life  Specifically  if it s business relationships that you want to improve  I would recommend reading this book with Never Eat Alone by Keith F    I have just finished this book  It is great and a lot of good info  I must for anyone who plans to talk to other people  Excellent book on how to make your friends  business partners  and subordinates like you  If you lead people  it will help provide you some simple good tips to be liked by your group  Interesting review of human motives and how common sense goes a long way  Good book  Nice perspective to build better human relationships  really blaze my social life to a higher level lqd qrt hdh lktb mt qbl mrtyn whw ktb jyd

wlkn dyl krnyjy ystHq lshkr wlthn  l  hdh l ml Very good  Its one of those self help books that inspires  Every word rings true and as you read it you think to yourself  yah thats right but I already knew that  but its all here in one place  If you are in any business  or want to know more about yourself  and other people  This is a must read  More like a book you ll want to read year after year  Excellent  I took notes and also underlined certain passages  I m glad I own this book as I plan to re read it  I needed this  I needed a great 2015 reading ending with an extraordinary book like this    Even though this book was written a while ago  the principles still apply today  I ve even tried applying them in my life already  Excellent read  I love this book  It s so simple and so straightforward  Everyone needs to read it   I know the title  but this has helped me more in mothering than many parenting books  That alone made it worth the purchase price   This is one of those books I d buy in crates and hand out to every single person who comes to see me  I had seen the book everywhere and mistook it to be one of those get rich quick books that led people astray  I was wrong  The book is profound  The book is a powerful take on what it takes to get by in this world  Whether we like it or not our number one job is to work with people and they are the one constant in our lives  I am truly impressed by the timeless principles of this book and intend to read it again in the near future  hi Greate book helped me alot in my Life I know it s an oldie  but it is a goldie  Easy to read  Taught me a lot about myself and the world around me  Definitely gives you food for thought  Very well written  the examples are a bit outdated but still serve the purpose  I would love to see a re write of this book  using more current examples  This is the most amazing non fiction book I have ever read  No doubt about it I am heading to college this year and I m so glad that I read this unlike many others who wouldn t even know about this gem of a book No wonder it has been around for decades   its principles are still as important now as when Carnegie first wrote them  If everyone in the world had read this book  we would have peace in all countries  Human suffering would be cut down by an immeasurable amount  If you think of it  most of the times that we ve been upset is due to someone else s mishandling of a situation  This book changes all that I know how many times this might have been said  but this is a book that can really change the course of lives  It really creates a  new you  and once planted  Carnegie s ideas won t leave your mind  His words will be reverberating in your head all the time  and trust me  that s a hell of a good thing  I don t know how much more of a higher recommendation I could give this book  Basically  if you want to live an amazing life  read this  And quick  Written earlier in the last century but the stories still show relevance in how the principles relate to human relationships  This is a great book  I view it a guide to succeed in my work enviroment  I highly recommend it  Strakhotna  Karnegi   predi i sled  dve vseleni   Everyone should read this book  Dozens of simple persuasion tips for everyday living  Great illustrations of why alternative self centered approaches  which most people use all the time  including  before reading the book  me   are counter productive  Deep and rich book about how to deal with people  despite the quite shallow title  Showed me how 30 simple   but certainly not always easily applicable   principles can minimize my conflicts  enrich my relationships and generally make me a happier  more peaceful human being  The book is filled with a vast collection of valuable case studies and examples  This book is my reference whenever I encounter a difficult relationship that requires skillful communication  A must read for everybody  I can definitely feel a difference in interacting with people and getting a positive response from them  It was one of my first book when I starded to built the bussines  I was shy and this book help me in relationship at work and at home  I recommerd it  Read long time ago and recommend it frequently to friends I know  A great little book that changed my understanding of people  Had a great impact on my dealing with people  A master piece  It s a must read for anyone who wants to understand America where this book has become part of its folklore   The title doesn t do it justice  I was half expecting some slime ball manual of how to fake being a sympathetic person  On the contrary  this is a classic  Its message is that if you want to do well with people  you d better become interested and considerate and pleasant to be around  The book tells you how  over and over  with principles and examples and anecdotes  The phrase  don t judge a book by it s cover  was probably coined in reference to this book  Although I admit the book s title is overly aggressive  anyone wishing to learn more about the nature of human relations will love this  An amazing book and a definite must read for individuals in the corporate world and those willing to join  Most of the principles if not all  that have been cited by Carnegie are terrific  They are not principles that have merely been stated to make the book seem fancy  But here are some techniques that can actually be put to practice in daily life   and that s the most amazing part What I liked about the book The fact that you can actually make an effort to practice the principles mentioned in the book What I disliked about the book Too many examples have been cited for every principle  For somebody like me  who hates books with a lot of pages   too many examples would just get me irritated Total rating  8 0   8 5 on 10 An excellent book for improving relationships with people to increase success in all facets of life  There s a reason this is a classic  and if you re going to read persuasion and influence books  this is a great place to start  It s practical and not scientific  the way most pop sci books are today  There aren t worksheets or quizzes    simply anecdotes  well written  from which the reader is free to take what he she may  Everything I read I didn t realize I was already learning from my mother My mom is a branch manager in one of the most well known Insurance companies  She s managed her people very well and have managed conflicts and challenging situations with such professionalism  I am about to start my own business and being the introvert that I am I thought I needed extra help to learn how to influence people  After finishing the book  I just realized that everything I read I was already learning from my mother  I just didn t realize it before because there was no specific blueprint to how she does things to become such an influential manager  This book explains everything and I can t wait to practice everything I ve learned here  My  1 recommended book to read  Started applying many of the subjects to my every day life  Found myself smiling more  engaging more  complementing more  looking for positives in everything  listening more  listening before speaking  more comfortable speaking in front of groups  and overall enjoying life more  I will definitely read it again   Highly recommend it very practical and easy to follow  Leadership 101   a must read for a anyone who wants to be successful in business  Great book for the 20 something  I use this DAILY  completmenting others  asking questions about them  and getting them to hear you out  GREATEST WAY TO AVOID AN ARGUMENT  wHd mn jml wrw  lktb ll  qrth f Hyt  lktb d msh y n  z  tksb Sdq lktb d y n  z  t ysh Hy  mlyn  rH  nfsy  shbwwwwwww ldyl krnyj  bjd  Really well expressed with clear examples  this book looks at human interaction and helps one to be more humble and thoughtful to bring about better interaction and relationships  Very good and a pleasant read   though I take that it may be hard to live out the values it expresses as much as I d like ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC  I hope to continue reading and re reading this for years    Everyone should read this book  Highly highly recommend this  The principles in this book originally written in 1936 are just as important today  I d read this book a number of years ago and found it wise to read it again  Now to apply it  Should be required reading for everyone  Valuable insight into understanding and getting along with people  If you read this book and practice the principles inside it s guaranteed to improve your relations with everyone   Great book  Helps you be a good friend  It was writen back in the days   aka   my grandpa read it in college  Each chapter addresses a different issue when dealing with people  I was hesitant to know if I should give this four or five stars   I used the same adjectives a lot  and it got a bit repetitive  but something like this you need to repeat a lot  I found this on my boss Mike s bookshelf and decided to read it  My friend Kathy s son Dan told me to read it years ago    and I am just getting aroung to it   it was a real eye opener and I think that everyone should read it and if I ever see it at the thrift store I am going to buy it  I think that it also helped me from getting in an argument with the guy I have been going sorta dating   because before I said something I thought about what I had been reading and decided to say it different  So I am very grateful that I read it and it has a lot of good ideas of how we can say things to people  There is a reason people still read this book and recommend it almost 100 years after its first publication  A must read  No matter who you are what your field  or goal is  everyone should read this book asap  So simple and so easily forgotten  One of those books to re read every year  I bought this book in its original print at 12 years old at a garage sale for 10 cents  That dime spent changed my life    This book made my High School career AMAZING simply by following the advise contained within  I recommend this book to EVERYONE    I confess that I have previously thought of this book as a guidebook on manipulation  Then I started reading it and soon discovered how wrong that thinking was  To be sure  some malicious types would use the principles of this book to manipulate others to their own ends  Yet the heart of this book is centred on improving one s intra personal manner and fostering strong  mutually beneficial relationships in both business and home life  The principles expounded in this book are backed up by a well researched litany of anecdotal evidence  Sure  the principles come across as obvious and common sense  But this book reminds us that common sense is at times  possibly due to pride  ego  or insecurity  not as common as one would think   At my first reading  I thought Dale Carnegie might have had a serious psychological problem with human relationship in his young age  Because his point of view in the book is filled with irony  and I believe he was a misanthropic  He defined people as emotional creatures like animals  He seemed to think human is foolish all in all  and have to manupulate the power for himself in a good way to servive in the cruel world  I read the reviews of other s Goodreads review  and some people felt exact the same like me   Dale Carnegie told us how to manipulate people  and it s not How to win friends   But I think Dale Carnegie is not a bad person because he opened his mind in his own book even he believes human is foolish  He put us all cards on the table  which means he trusted people in a some way  I imagine he faced to some relationship problems and desperated human Maybe  he put wrong title on the book   Friends  is not  Friends  most people think for him  Some reviewers would feel weird  Friends  things  Most people think  Friends  are not thing to make use of He should put the title  Listen to everything people want to say  and you can make enemies help you like a friend     or something like that  In Japan  the title  How to Win Friends and Influence People  is not adopted  I got the book title like  How to motivate people   So  I can see just few negative reviews in Japanese book market  Dale Carnegie s method of motivating people is however useful except his irony to human  So I gave 5 stars   If you re planning on reading only one psychology book in your life  you better make it this one   strongly recommended  a great read  Simply put  the greatest book on sales ever written  Sublime and powerful   worth reading every year  Fantastic    Read it when i was a teenager n it changed my life    I ve read it more than a dozen times  Great guide to human relations  a very profitable asset  Easy read with tons of examples  Suggest highlighting key points within chapters  A book everyone should own  Smile  always smile and ever try to win an argument cause u lose it    Fascinating  provides great ideas for improving interpersonal relations   One of the most impactful books I have ever read   ry   w l fDl fy mjlh mn lktb lty yjb n tqr h  kthr mn mrh  Re read on Audiobook and loved it again  Fantastic and insightful  Standard reading in this genre  I love this book  My copy is from 1964 and yellowed  but one of my dearest books  I think reading this book was a life changing event for me  A must read for every human being  Fantastic book with timeless wisdom   A book I go back to over and over  Yes  it is old  and yes it is anecdotal  but it is one of the best and most helpful books I have ever read  Read this book many many years ago  but still benefit from the lessons  It helped me work through business and personal issues  I read it during the time of my marriage to Essi after only knowing him for 6 weeks  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK  Great book  One of those that should probably be read year on year to reinforce the principles  It was a good book I read it a long time ago  I gave to my ex wife as a gift for her birthday  Truly amazing a must read for all even those who don t read  I m always sceptical about reading such works  mainly because it s difficult to admit I would need help in the socialising department  but this book is well worth a read   One of the best books I ve read Dale was would be one of a hell copywriter  He makes you to read this piece of art without leaving book at all And yeah  he gives you some great timeless advice If you work in sales marketing this should be on your shelves  If you want to be nicer person get it  If you want to improve your communication with other  then    This book should be on your shelves Get it to understand how some people could get something from you by acting nice in specific way or saying some nice words  With this knowledge you can avoid being manipulated in so many occasions  A book every one should read   This book changed the way I manage people  Great advice  While I ve read most of this information in other books or magazines before  I love the way that the author puts things  Example   Criticisms are like homing pigeons  They always return back   I always heard that this was one of those books that  everyone NEEDS to read   but by it s title I was never very interested  I m so glad I finally picked it up after I found a 1960s copy in a large lot of books I purchased  Fascinating study of people  relationships and how essentially we are all the same  I will read this again one day and I will make sure my children read it  I recommend this book to anyone who talks  interacts in any way with other people   P    Love this book  It has tidbits for all aspects of life   leadership  parenting  friendships     A bench mark in human relations  This should be part of everybody s educational curriculum as they move through life  Excellent book   Absolutely brilliant    One of my favourite books       I personally really like this book This is a very good read This is a very good book  It is informative and motivational  The stories are interesting and encouraging and keeps your attention   The book raises useful hints on how to deal with people  As a reader  you would realize that all principles are rational and logic  hence you need to keep them all listed to refresh your memory with  I like various hints such as Persons name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language Make the other person feel important and do it sincerely  When two partners always agree  one of them is not necessary Distrust your first instinctive impression Show respect for other people opinions  never say you are wrong This is a good book to start with to win you friends and influence people and finally be a good leader  I really liked this book  Unfortunately  the title kept me away from it for a long time  as it sounds more like how to manipulate people rather than  the way to win friends and influence people is to be honest and humble   One of those     an oldie but a goodie   My Grandma gave me her old worn copy of this one and said that besides the scriptures this book influenced her the most  One to read and read again  An excellent update to Carnegie s powerful principles   distilled in an manageable packet for teens  Brilliant  Loved it  Highly recommend to everyone   Great book for anyone in any walk of life  not just the business world  You would be a fool not to read this book  It has changed the way I think about life   Excellent read recommended to me by a college friend  Helped me to improve my conversation skills and become a better listener  Would highly recommend  This is a book I always need to return to  Provides the basic rules and concepts for successful interpersonal relationships  A fantastic book  Just read this for the second time  I consider everything discussed in this book to be common sense for society  Regardless of the examples stemming from the 1930 s  the principles are so essential for general interaction  And considering how socially retarded we all are today  in varying degrees   this book is even more important with every passing year My only qualm about this book  the title  It is misleading  It gives the impression  to me  of a book that is one of the repulsive  can do   reach for the stars  rubbish literature that is so widespread  Had Carnegie made the title something like  How to Be a Civilized Person  would have been more effective    but even that title  apart from being lame  doesn t do it justice   Must read book The language and anecdotes are dated but the pages are practically worth their weight in gold  This book is full of sage advice that would move anyone forward in life  I ll probably re read this book once a year to keep me out of mental ruts at work  The best productivity book I ve read till now The way the author puts forward the gist  through  been there  done that  examples in just too good  Makes you just sail through the pages with delight Been using these principles in life too  Believe me  they do work wonders    Ok  so cheesy title and salesmanship in the introduction aside  this book wasn t at all slimy or cynical   The principles of this book will only work if they come from the heart  I m not advocating a bag of tricks   the author stresses  The 1930s language is charmingly old school once you get used to it None of these principles are really groundbreaking revelations  people skilled in human interaction are probably doing most or even all of them already  However  this book is inspiring and left me confident that I have lots of improvements to make in how I deal with family  friends  and co workers  and that knowing the path is different from walking the path   qtn  nskh  lwld lt  qtnh f   wkhr lstyntmn  rw  lktb lt  s dtn  kthyran f   ktsb mhrt  jtm y  f  bdy  Hyt wmzlt  dhkr mnh b d l nwyn lry ysy  wlqSS lshyq  nSH bqrth Brilliant book  Must read for everyone  Warren Buffett dijo de Dale Carnegie que le cambio la vida Asi que quien soy yo para negarlo  Creo que este libro  entre todos los libros que tiene Dale Carnegie son libros que deberian ser de lectura obligada en la educacion publica El libro nos muestra las facetas mas basicas de la ingenieria social  o dicho de otro modo  Como ser educado y entenderse con los demas Pese a que el libro se tiende a mover mucho en el ambito empresarial y comercial  creo que es un libro muy valido para todo el mundo  ya que todos  en un momento u otro  necesitamos explicarnos de la forma mas adecuada posible para que otro los entienda y ademas no solo consigamos de el lo que nosotros necesitamos  si no que podriamos incluso conseguir que el quiera que nosotros consigamos lo que queremos Los conceptos escritos en este libro son realmente faciles y simples  Se pueden asimilar sin mucho problema  y podemos incluso llegar a darnos cuenta de lo importante que son ciertos habitos que en muchas veces hemos olvidado El libro ademas explica como se deberia leer segun Dale Carnegie  Ya que este nos propone el leer un capitulo  Dejarlo madurar  Y volverlo a leer al dia siguiente y si se quiere  otro capitulo mas  Y seguir con la rueda de dejarlo madurar y leer todos los capitulos dos veces  para asimilar los conceptos  Yo lo he leido de esta forma y me ha parecido una idea interesante  con una segunda lectura se sacan impresiones diferentes  Lo malo de leerlo de esta forma es que se tarda mas de leer de lo previsto  pero merece la pena Conclusion Este es un libro que deberia leer todo el mundo   I can honestly say that EVERYONE  yes YOU  needs to read this book  Just using the basic principals within my own family is making a world of difference  This is a book to read over and over and over again  I d give it 6 stars if I could  A MUST HAVE in every personal library across the world  Powerful philosophy   So many tips  The book suggests you read each chapter twice  Well I made sure I did  and I know I got a lot more from it for that  The book gives you several short tips  then a 5 10 minute chapter explaining that tip  Write those tips down and the entire book will stick  Definitely something I plan on reading again someday  Anyone who works with others and wants to improve their relationship with their colleagues  or even friends family  should read this   My favorite lesson from this book  the one that has stuck with me for years  is how to listen to people  You have to be genuinely interested in what they re saying In social settings this is especially valuable  Everyone we meet is better than me at something  or knows more about something than I do  and it s my job to find out what it is  It serves two purposes  first  people enjoy talking about themselves  second  I learn something  and last  it s easier to listen to others with genuine interest in what they re saying when what they re talking about is interesting to both them and you  My father gave me this book in my early teens  it was given him by his father  It s a very  very tired old paperback  I can t read it anymore for fear of it falling to bits but that s OK since i ve got it on my Nook This is the great grandaddy of all self help books  which i find ironic since its focus is on how we treat other people  I hate to make sweeping generalizations but it seems to me that our culture of individuality tends to put the focus on self  and self interest at the expense of others  Hence  the irony of this book is to inform us in no uncertain terms that our self interest is inextricably entwined with the interests of others  So if we want others to like us  we want them to do what we want them to do  and we want to be happy  then we need to like other people  do what they want us to do  and see to their happiness In very rough terms  this book is an elaboration on the Golden Rule  Except it doesn t stop with pithy aphorisms but goes into detail about how others want to be treated  and why  It often illustrates points by describing how you  yourself  want to be treated  and you may be surprised to discover how much you didn t know about that  If i have any criticism of this book it might be for its title  which seems unfortunately cynical from a superficial perspective  But on the other hand it may be a brilliant title because anyone who picks up this book purely for its manipulative potential is going to quickly discover that it simply doesn t work in the absence of sincerity and authenticity  So there s the potential for turning a manipulative person into a sincere one  by means of appealing to his self interest  Oh  the irony    One of the best books ever  A life changing read for me and highly recommended  This is one of the best books I have ever read  I will be taking some notes before it goes back to the library  My mom has been recommending it for years I am glad I finally picked it up  I read Dale Carnegie when I was in my teens  His books are life changing and give you a fresh perspective on life  Must read for anybody aspiring to do anything positive in life  Best book on how to communicate with others  The focus on Abraham lincoln s approach to difficult people was especially helpful   ymkn trtyb b D lnf lt  br lstnbT mn hdh lktb ljmyllsym n knt mqrnh f  b D lmlHZt tbd h blnfs wl  This book is brilliant  Honestly one of the best I ve read  I think everyone should read this  perhaps multiple times  I know I ve heard the name tossed around for years but I m so glad I actually sat down and read it  Actually  I plowed through it  It was fascinating  applicable  and has already helped me reconsider my approach to certain people and situations  An absolute must read  Wonderful book  It gives a great deal of insight as to how everyone can become a better listener and friend  A wonderful book  I think I had let the title stop me from reading it for so many years from fear of manipulation  Silly  This is a great guide into how individuals like to be treated and why  and how we can keep these ideas in mind when interacting with others  I don t buy many books  After reading this one via the public library  I bought myself a copy  Even if the book was published long ago the psychology and philosophy of basic human nature and wants remains the same  which has been taken out very beautifully by the author  A recommended read for all  must read  life changing book you would say   yes ofcourse    sheesh  its not sumthing new for me at all   and yet  you re not doing it   Dale Carnegie put the ways of influencing arent really like telling you what to do  but with such interesting story  The moment i read this  i said  please god  just lemme be the only one whoever read this book    hehehe My mother has been telling me about this book ever since I was a little kid  She said that my father s mother had read and recommended this book to her but it was banned in their home country at the time  I suddenly remembered to search for it today   and so far  the first chapter is amazing  Definitely in the best interest for ppl of all ages  I know I ll be buying my kids a copy when they reach high school     A staple for any business owners or corporate professions which require that you deal with people a lot   qr th 3 mrt wfy kl mr   jd shyy  jdyd ywfq tGyrt l mr wlmkn   So obvious that you think it will not work  and it works like a charm  This book not only radiates positivity for your inner self but also to the people around you  A great read for me  and hopefully for you as well  An absolute classic  and I think a must read for all people  It s mostly common sense  but by golly is is well articulated common sense that might make you think about the way you run your life  Wonderful stuff   Mi sono accorto di non avere scritto una recensione di questo libro  quindi rimedio subito perche lo ritengo uno dei libri che piu ha influito sul mio modo di essere Titolo orrendo  sia in Inglese  che in Italiano   per un libro la cui lettura ritengo essenziale per qualsiasi persona  Di fatto e un manuale di comportamento  l autore in ogni capitolo descrive un   abilita  che sarebbe utile sviluppare per trarre il meglio dalle interazioni tra le persone  Lo stile e estremamente scorrevole  a volte colloquiale  si ha l impressione di ascoltare le parole di un saggio anziano che racconta aneddoti riguardanti numerosi personaggi del passato come se fossero suoi amici di vecchia data per supportare le proprie tesi  Tesi che  alla fine di ogni capitolo  sono sintetizzati sotto forma di regole  di  comandamenti  Molto interessante e la premessa dell autore  che invita ad incorporare nelle proprie abitudini i consigli elargiti  Il libro va letto lentamente  meditando  sottolineando  glossando e provando a mettere in pratica gli insegnamenti settimana dopo settimana  Non e un volume da leggere e poi riporre in libreria e dimenticarsene  bensi va costantemente tenuto a portata di mano e va riletto  di tanto in tanto  per rinfrescare la memoria  Per questi motivi consiglio di possedere un edizione fisica  non una versione ebook Leggetelo e spargete la voce  mi raccomando  Es increible que luegomd etantos anos  este libro siga teniendo la misma   o incluso mas  vigencia que cuando se escribio  Siempre lo recomiendo  el lbro no cntiene mas que ensenanzas practicas y utiles en la vida laboral y personal  Great book  The granddaddy of all self development books  up there with Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill  The info in here has been adopted by virtually every other life coach or self help guru  but its good to go back to the source  It never felt dated to me  but rather that info here is timeless   Although the book teaches principals we  this day in age  have heard before  reviewing such important life skills is incredibly invaluable  It s one of the best reminders I have read in how to relate to others  Its a book I intend to read and review throughout my life  and I d highly recommend others do the same  It should be a part of everyone s book collection  The world would undoubtedly be a better place for it  Great book for introverts      Very insightful  The book has justified the author s acclaim and is definitely worth a read   This book changed my life forever  Hello This book should be a must read for anyone in leadership or who aspires to be in leadership  I have seen far too many managers directors vice presidents etc  in my career where bullying is a daily occurrence and fear is used as a motivator  This book is old  but the advice is gold and will help you grow in not only your professional life but in your personal relationships as well  Ageless advice on treating people with respect and how you would want to be treated I loved this book  It talked about manors we learner as kids but have gone out of practice  Simple things you can do to communicate successfully with people  Really interesting  full of examples and very precise PD  Tips have really worked for me It s a great book  After reading Dale s  how to stop worrying  it s a bit disappointing at first  because he says same things  but further I read more useful info I got  It doesn t teach how to manipulate people  I find title quite inappropriate   it helps not to stress because of them and don t be discouraged to communicate  And most importantly it teaches how to be kind  don t have negative feelings towards others  resolve conflicts and be humble  An excellent book and the precursor to self help books  Dale Carnegie s book is filled to the brim with great tips and advice to become a person with better interpersonal skills The book itself is easily read and Carnegie favors clarity to tell what you should do to become more liked but also why  The strength of the book is clearly in the many examples and anecdotes of people who have used the advice to great effect Some of the tips or  principles  as they are known as in the book however do overlap each other and by carefully reading you can glimpse many insights of human nature Overall a great book and if everybody read this I am sure the world would be headed to a better place  I think about this book nearly every time I interact with someone  whether consciously or not   I ve never forgotten its simple principle of CASH  Care about the person you re talking to  Ask questions about them  Smile genuinely  and Help whenever you can  I m not good at this  but I work on it all the time because I know it is so effective in not only helping you  influence people   but in being a happier person  Fabulous book  THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVOTITE BOOK OF ALL TIME  This book has helped me through relationship problems  work problems  and has made me a better person overall  It discusses the fundamental techniques in handing people  how to win people to your way of thinking  ways to make people like you  and how to be a leader  It is all common sense  but as we all know  common sense is not always common practice  It is not a business book  a relationship book  or a self help book  It is a life book   my life has been changed forever by it   and hopefully I have helped others improve their lives because of it as well  I have this book many times and listened to the audiobook many times   I love this book and have read it several times  Fantastic yet amazingly simple concepts    should be required reading for high school and college  It is kind of a tips book  according to the way he wrote  it is also easy to be understood  You will even know the inside only by reading the page of contents  He divided it into 4 big chapters  The first one is  Teknik Teknik Dasar Dalam Menangani Manusia    Enam Cara Untuk Membuat Orang Lain Menyukai Anda  is the next chapter  and it is followed by  Bagaimana Memikat Orang Lain Mengkuti Cara Berpikir Anda   and the last one is  Jadilah Pemimpin  Bagaimana Mengubah Orang Lain Tanpa Menyinggung atau Membangkitkan Kemarahan   Sorry for not changed it into English  I am just afraid to ruin the ori version Plenty stories which were written there were based on his class experiences  as he told  Other stories came from his research about some well known people at his era  No wonder  some of stories leaving its good impressions in my mind  It gives some points that we could believe if the tips are really working in our daily life  and seems its work forever just like the way he convinced it to the reader  Even somehow  I felt boring with it s monotony plot  He depicted problems  giving some succeeded samples to overcome the problems  and ended it with a conclusion  That is the right plot for sure  and that is how an article should be written  perhaps  I mean  it will be more interesting  at least for me  if he could plays with the plot  Or  maybe it because of me who is quick to get bored of anything Overall  this book is great  It helps to realize if we  human beings  need to get appreciation  love to have attention from others  selfish  conceited  arrogant  and so on  He said those matters as basic human behavior  The tips he gave are about how to handle those behavior whenever we meet to treat people  The easiest way  from which I concluded  is to treat them as the way you treat yourself  What will suit you  probably  suit them either  What you dislike  perhaps  they do also  This book is fantastic  The book is filled with expert advice on how to deal with people  I think what made it so great was that it wasn t filled with tricks  but emphasized that you need to be genuine  It talks of complimenting people  but reminds the reader that people can see through empty flattery  For example  it discusses the technique of complimenting a person before mentioning a flaw or mistake  but then it provides the additional advice that so many people forget   if the compliment is general and fake  and is quickly followed by a  but  it was worthless  It states that the book provides a new way of thinking   a way that appreciates people  sees their value  and looks at situations from the other person s perspective  In discussing techniques in making business deals  it emphasizes that the deal should be beneficial to both parties  The book isn t about manipulating people  but just understanding people and treating them better   which inspires friendship and better work  One of my favorite parts of the book were the examples provided of people using the techniques and how that improved various situations  Altogether  this is a great book  I plan to read the book again and think it s a must read for anyone who works with people   or otherwise ever has human contact  The best book on socializingThe best book on socializingthis is pretty much the essential self help book their is  being social is critical in our everyday life  let this be the guide for everyone looking to improve your disk skills   This book is amazing  It really looks at one of the most important aspects of human nature  the need to feel important  The author doesn t simply exploit this need  yet he takes it and shows how humility on your part can play a powerful role in empowering another person  This book is not the kind of book with a simple plan and execution scheme  yet it deals with growth and maturity  It lays out ideals which one must aspire to be through patience  humility  keeping a calm head  and allowing the other person to feel as important as they are  confucius would be more comprehensive A book every manager should read  They would become better at handling people and have more friendly team  Great Book  I read the Digital Age version

Title  How to Win Friends   Influence PeopleAuthor  Dale CarnegiePages  288Publisher  Published August 24th 2010 by Pocket  first published 1936   This book is officially my favourite book of the year  This book is incredible  it teaches a student the most crucial skills to deal with people  This book revolves around a few theme  everyone likes to always talk in his or her own best interest and everyone who is alive needs to feel a sense of importance  If there is any of a book that I would like to have my brainwashed  How to Win Friends   Influence People will be it  The structure of the book divides into a few parts  Within each part  it contains a few chapters  Inside each chapter  it summarizes principal s  at the of each chapter  And of each principal  it is accommodated with specific stories that proves the true value of the principal s   The principals are recommended to be practiced by the author in our real world   to deal with people  I read this book during Spring Break  I was very surprised that a scholarship that I applied to also require me to read this book  I felt fortunate that I read this book because with the knowledge I gain from this book  I applied to the real world to compete for the scholarship   and I got it at the end  Thanks to this book  With no further explanatory  I highly recommend this book to high school students and adults  How to Win Friends   Influence People is not only teaching you how to win friends nor to influence people  it is the basic education of morals  I believe it is   This book helps people to survive in the real world   in particular people who work in the business field   The kind of book that you say of course for everything you read but when it cools down to practice  it is definitely an eye opener  good read and alot of eye opening ideas Much better than I expect  Provided many examples where these strategies worked that were quite interesting  I definitely have tried to apply more of these concepts to my day to day interactions  When I first started reading this book I thought it was bullshit  Not complete and utter bullshit  but overall bullshitty  Of course  it put forward ideas that were kind of nice but they stroke me as nearly impossible to apply in the real world  and the examples provided seemed contrived  It was very hard to believe that people would fall for these kinds of   what I perceived to be   manipulative approaches  And  if these did somehow work  I wasn t sure I wanted to adopt this mentality anyway As I read on  the book didn t change  The ideas and examples in it didn t change  Somehow  though  my feelings towards it changed  Somehow  I started to understand I ve often been accused of being way too nice to people  too tolerant  too polite  even  on occasion  of being a pushover or a doormat  I ve been advised to be harsher and care less about what other people think feel want  Of course  we shouldn t let other people govern our lives  our behaviour and our decisions and  on that point  I always agreed with my critics  I even tried to be colder and meaner and  to some degree  I ve succeeded  that s not terribly hard to achieve  After all  it s not like I had a plethora of good opinions about everyone   I m just as judgemental  critical and selfish as the next person  And it s from this aspect that I drew my initial dislike of the book  because I thought it was trying to teach me precisely what I wanted to avoid  to care yet more about others than I do about me Still  I could never fully agree with the general opinion that I   that we   should be completely selfish  self sufficient and indifferent to the people around us  I could never share the same appreciation for  directness  that other people did  either  It especially peeved me when I heard things such as  I call  em like I see  em  or  I m just being honest and if you can t handle it then that s your problem  not mine   I dislike flattery and falseness as much as anyone  but I always did respect tact and diplomacy and was always of the opinion that extreme directness and an unfiltered speech are decidedly a failing and a disability  rather than a quality  A 5 year old child can just as easily  call  em like he sees  em   Sincerity isn t the same as bluntness  Virtually anyone can crush somebody else s self esteem or ruin a relationship  It takes a hell of a lot more to get people to listen to you And  not in the least  I do care about people  I mean  okay  not all people  not all the time  People are strange and curious creatures and the ones I meet and interact with are often challenging to my patience and my good will  But a pleasant interaction with a person   especially a person I d be naturally inclined to dislike   is so much more rewarding than having an argument or a power struggle  more rewarding than even winning one of the latter We all care about people  even those of us who claim to be indifferent  independent and perpetually unfazed  And we should care  The secret is to do it intelligently This is where Carnegie s book excelled  It explained to me where I was horribly wrong and reinforced the beliefs that were surprisingly right  It taught me the way to not simply filter out the  evil  in my speech and phrase my insults in nicer words  but to really respect and appreciate people  truthfully  without being dishonest and manipulative and  more importantly  without sacrificing my identity in the process We re all driven by more or less the same emotions  we all feel the same longings  we re all motivated by roughly the same phenomena and we feel the same pain  sadness and resentment when our desires are not met  Self esteem  the need for a feeling of importance  a love of praise and an ingrained fear of criticism and rejection   these are all human traits  they re all natural and we all share these in common  Recognising these things in other people and fully taking them into account in your interactions is an amazing way to reach the same wavelength with others  It helps to understand them  appreciate them  find a common ground between their feelings and your feelings  between what they want and  ultimately  what YOU want   and do all of this earnestly  gladly  full heartedly I m not saying I ll suddenly become the perfect human specimen now that I ve read this book  I know I won t apply quite all of the principles in it and I most likely won t even remember all of them  I m certain that  even if I carried the book around like a gospel and practised all of its teachings to the letter  there d be a million cases where they would fail horribly  People are largely unpredictable and this book is far from a fix all But it did promise to change my life   if I were to let it   and it did  to a certain extent  It strengthened in me the belief that the people around me are important  that respecting them is important and that being an overall patient  kind  sincere and tactful person can accomplish great things in the long run  It gets five stars from me  not necessarily for its specific teachings  although they re pretty useful  too  but mainly for its very significant message  This is one of the finest books on social behavior ever written Can t say anything bad about this classic  In today s day and age  everything Carnegie wrote about could be found across a variety of self help articles online  but I would still suggest giving this book a read as the example focused writing makes it easy to absorb Favorite excerpt   There is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an argument   and that is to avoid it  Its an amazing book   which tells you the way people thinks about you and how to deal with this to win them to your side   An incredible book  I have learnt so much on how to be both intuitive and receptive to the needs of others  including how to communicate better   and to also be a better listener     This is excellent  It challenges both your value of the people around you as well as how you convey that to them  and provides helpful ways and insight to improve in your relationships with anyone you encounter   An amazing manual  one I will re read for a very long time  How to Win Friends   Influence People is still one of the Top 40 Amazon Bestsellers for a reason  Dale Carnegie wrote this book in 1936 because no one was aware of anything like it in existence  All recent works I ve read on the Great Depression marveled at its importance  Carnegie taught public speaking and became such a popular lecturer that eventually he turned his lectures into this book and updated it throughout his life with real life illustrations that his students sent to him  The edition I read was revised in 1981 and has been updated by the editors with some 1970s examples  making the book slightly odd   More than 8 million people in 80 countries have taken his training course  Dale Carnegie would tell you that he made a living all these years  not by teaching public speaking   that was incidental  His main job was to help people conquer their fears and develop courage  Carnegie was scholarly beast in studying people  having read hundreds of biographies and critiqued something like 150 000 speeches What Carnegie writes jives with recent articles on what Google is looking for in an employee   how to be someone who leads with confidence  The importance of humility and personal ownership of your own mistakes  while emphasizing others  achievements  Expertise is the least important to Google and to Carnegie  15 percent of one s financial success is due to one s technical knowledge and about 85 percent is due to skill in human engineering   to personality and the ability to lead people    p  22 23 This is a book that probably been little improved on by other self help books of the same genre  only the details remain   for which you can find in psychology books  Carnegie gets his point across with probably a couple hundred stories  ranging from tales of Presidents  Lincoln  Taft  Hoover  TR  FDR  and titans of industry  Andrew Carnegie  Rockefeller  Schwab  to various lecture attendees who wrote Carnegie over the years  the index is impressive   Some of these stories  particularly those of Lincoln   make the point stick in my mind quite vividly  The American history in the book is great  There are also oft overlooked biblical references  much of what Carnegie is saying is strongly encouraged in the New Testament You can read an outline of the chapters on wikipedia I have read many works on pop psychology  and even though I m aware of my own cognitive biases I still am quite susceptible  A smile from a person makes me like them more   makes me assume other positive attributes about the person   People who smile  tend to manage  teach and sell more effectively  and to raise happier children  That s why encouragement is a much more effective teaching device than punishment    quoting a psychologist  pg  204  I am often around politicians in hallways and have noticed that they tend to greet strangers with a warm smile  hold the door open for people far behind them  and perform other people pleasing gestures  It s central to their core  Carnegie gives several examples of politicians and industry leaders in this book who do exactly the same thing   it s central to their personalities and helps explain their success  People like them just because they seem warm and friendly  I need to smile more  I need to remember more names and call people by their names  All the time This week I had a rather critical email written to someone  with a complete rational argument  I felt it was my duty  conviction to correct the person s error  I then shelved it  I am going to re write tactfully Carnegie style  I may still never send it One of the more powerful points Carnegie makes is that  You can t win an argument    One of his principles is to  never criticize   but he later has a chapter entitled  How to Criticize  and Not Be Hated for It    Why prove to a man he is wrong  Why not let him save his face  He didn t ask for your opinion  He didn t want it  Why argue with him     What price will I have to pay if I win    p  312  326 It demeans people when you set out to prove them wrong  it says  I m smarter than you and here s why   It is obviously not the ideas themselves that are dear to us  but our self esteem which is threatened   338  when someone challenges us   Two thousand years ago  Jesus said   Agree with thine adversary quickly    356    A s Charles Schwab put it   hearty in their approbation and lavish in their praise   All of us want that  So let s obey the Golden Rule and give unto others  lavish praise  what we would have others give unto us  How  When  Where  All the time  everywhere  Owning up to one s owns faults is important  especially before entering into a critique of another or in an argument  When we are right  let s try winning people gently and tactfully to our way of thinking  and when we are wrong  and that will be surprisingly often   let s admit our mistakes quickly and with enthusiasm   376    Almost all people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some way  and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize their importance      290  So  encourage others to talk about themselves  talk in terms of their interests  and make them feel important Criticism in the absence of an understanding of total love and or respect is going to be harmful  I can scold my son or criticize my wife for something only if they know that they are 100  secure in my unconditional love  I should draw attention to their mistakes  indirectly   and ask questions rather than giving orders   for which Carnegie gives several examples  An important point in all cultures I ve lived in is to  let the other person save face   556  Carnegie has reinforced much of my belief in positive reinforcement of my son   a cornerstone of ABA therapy for autism  There s principle of  Make the fault seem easy to correct  590  and this is crucial in dealing with my son   the example in the book is one of a mentally challenged child who overcomes by gradually building his strength and confidence in certain tasks He ends the book on ways to encourage people toward success   namely focus on the process and small improvements   Give a dog a good name   579   Put the seed in the other person s mind that they are greater than what they realize   the results will follow as they become that person Fantastic  classic book  I give it 5 stars  mn mt  lktb lly qryth fy Hyty ln lktb shyq wmfyd  A beautiful book with loads of wisdom When you learn to stop talking all about yourself and start listening to others  your relationships evolve and become more meaningful  It s completely changed how I interact with people especially when I meet someone new  It s not manipulation  it s showing genuine interest in the other person  Great tips on social skills One the best books ever written  Why did it take me so long to read this  It will influence my people skills for the better  forever  Great insight into communication and relationship building  Altough I d recommend just reading a summary of the main points exposed in the book  as the book mainly consists of  good  examples of putting into practice the conducts the author recommends  Some of the principles  I already know  I must put this to good use right away  First published in 1937  this book is entertaining as well as thought provoking  The  influence people  part of the title threw me off  I thought the content would be tips on  manipulating  people to get what you want  which is why I ve put off reading it for so long  Carnegie actually addresses authenticity  consideration for others  and many effective communication techniques  A delightful  helpful book   This is a book that could change your life  An annual read     I always pick something useful     WOW  There is not possibly enough that I could say about this book  so I will keep it brief  Carnegie is one of the smoothest and most entertaining writers I have ever read  And he did his homework  He literally read hundreds of books to collect all of the impelling stories and evidence he presents in his book  This is one book I am determined to read once a year for the rest of my life   I think that this book is one of the greatest books ever  I loved reading because of this book  This is the best self help book I ve ever read  Using the tools in this book helped me immensly in my career  Even though some of the language and concepts are a bit out of date  the essence of this book still holds true  I learned a lot that I ve tried to implement in my roles at work and home  I also plan to reread this book periodically to keep the ideas fresh   I call this the path to awesomeness  Seriously  this is one of the most important lessons there is  how to win friends and influence people  This is such a hard lesson to learn but it is so basic  one of those kindergarten lessons  I just couldn t put this one down because it s so enlightening  I could just see being the kind of person who lights up the room and makes everyone feel better about themselves and is a general positive force in the universe  Now that is awesomeness  I ve read this book many times    starting 20  years ago  I think everyone should read this book every few years  It s required reading in my house  A timeless piece even in this time and age  Principles introduced should be read and re read from time to time  especially the key tenet  sincerely care about the lives of other people  ktb jyd f  kyfy  m ml  lns bSf   m  wlys l Sdq khS   rbT lnSy H bl mthl  mfyd f  tTbyqh   lmstw  lnsn  w lwq    nSH bqrth  good Llegue a este libro buscando algun material que hablara sobre la comunicacion no verbal y cuando lei el titulo reconozco que mi primer juicio fue el de es un tipico libro de auto ayuda  pero sin embargo comence a leerlo por intriga  Esta obrita creo que es elemental para todas aquellas personas que quieran mejorar las interacciones con otras personas  Sus reglas principales son las mismas que aplican muchas religiones o filosofias de vida como el budismo  a diferencia de que estan explicadas cosa que creo que a mas de uno nos hacia falta  que nos expliquen porque tenemos que hacer algo por otra persona La idea del libro que es lo que apliques a tu vida diaria sino seria como leer un prospecto de un medicamento y pensar que me voy a curar sin tomarlo  Note grandes cambios  comence a sentirme mejor y solo haciendo pequenos ajustes  Es fantastico como un libro o una aclaracion a ciertos temas pueden cambiar tu forma de ver  de pensar  de tratar al otro siempre y cuando se apliquen en tu vida  no Desde ya lo recomiendo totalmente   Fantastic book  that I ve also heard several general authorities recommend  It s pretty much just a reminder to be kind and smile and be interested in other people and their lives  but it s a great reminder  The author tells some fascinating stories and it makes me want to be a better person every time I read this book  A great book and perfect reference  One of the best self help book i ve read     This is a classic for a reason  It is filled with little quotes and anecdotes from some of histories greatest people  I will be returning to this again and again for talks and leadership training material   Outstanding bookOutstanding bookIt is the best book I have read  It entertaining and full of realistic everyday examples I can put in practice in and out of work   The best self improvement book that I have ever read so far    I found this book to be an entertaining and smart read  definitely applicable to modern readers despite its age  The author was insightful  experienced  and has a no nonsense approach to social and professional success  I absolutely loved this book  I think everyone should read it  Such wonderful information and so easy to use  It s really about being the best person you can be  I definitely will be reading it again and again  This book is an absolutely outstanding book if you care about how you interact with other people   whether it be at work  at church  or at home with family members  A lot of what was in this book was already an integral part of how I interact with people  but I learned a handful of very good lessons  I highly encourage anyone who interacts with people in any capacity to read this book  This is an excellent book  It took me a long time to read because I adhered to the way in which Carnegie expects the reader to cover the book  For example  the reading of each chapter twice  I recommend this to anyone that wants to enrich their personal and work interactions  One of the best self help books I ve read   this is like a bible for human relations  it should be read again and again  it s an awesome reference and a life changing companion as well  I read this book in Indonesian edition  I really like this book and give a real influence in my life  This book opened my eyes on how to make friends and influence others  A great book  classic and stands over time because the principles are so straight forward  sensible and applicable  They are things that make sense and that we should be doing daily with those we interact  Ive tried a few techniques and it s amazing the results and difference in the human response   especially with how ingrained in technology we are   it s surprising for someone be thanked  given a smile or praise  etc  Recommended read to anyone working with people     Which is all of us     What a pretty impressive book  Hopefully  I shall apply the principles  although it s kind of difficult to switch to a method you already know to another but I guess this is human nature  always adjusting and evolving I would definitely recommend it  This along with  How to stop worrying and start living  should be required reading for every high school senior  We need more people that understand and apply these principles in our society  This book has given me insight into how to win people over  like the title suggests  It caused me to rethink things I thought I knew  I would definitely recommend this to friends and family  This is definitely a book a new college graduate should read   hw Hqan ktb ry   ylhmk lqry th mjrd smh ykfy llhmk whw mfyd jdan ltHsyn lt ml m  lns wtkwyn  lqt mmyz  wjdyd  wn sh llh yfydkm Although the title is quite cheesy and makes people wonder what is wrong with you  this book is totally an eye opener  A lot of the ideas in this book made totally sense to me  I actually went along and incorporated some of them as soon as I was finished with a chapter into my daily life and was not disappointed by the results  Although the title suggests a really obnoxious salesmen businessmen attitude  the content is more focused on real  honest relationships between people  So  if you ever wondered  why some people seem to naturally be popular with everyone and why there are such people we call  social butterflies   this book shows you exactly what behaviors are responsible for this and how you can easily make them your own  too  and even if you don t  you learn some useful stuff about how to circumvent stressful interactions and fights with other people and how to be a nicer  more approachable person in general   A must read for how to get better at building relationships  I have the hard copy edition for easy reference  Even  my Michael has read it twice  This is truly a superb book  It would be enough to leave it at that  The brilliant Dale Carnegie did an outstanding job in writing this book  How to Win Friends   Influence People is a book that makes you think about sociology  how you perceive other people  but most importantly  how other people perceive you  How to Win Friends   Influence People is an excellent publication that if read by all  would make our society exponentially better It is outstanding that Carnegie has managed to wedge so much knowledge and insight into a mere 262 pages  Every word Carnegie placed throughout the entirety of this text seems to have a particular purpose  Every dozen pages  or so  I felt the urge to stop reading and reflect upon Carnegie s teachings  I feel that this is the pinnacle of self help books  As a matter of fact  this feels less like a self help book  and more of a lucubration of Carnegie s philosophy I feel that reading this book has had a tremendous impact on my life  It has changed how I interact with others  and has made me notice how others interact with me  I feel that this is a great book to be read by anyone  I might even call this book life changing  This gives me the sense that I can read other s minds  I can tell why other people do what they do  and what I can do to make them do what I want to do  If everyone were to treat this book as a bible  the world would be a great place In conclusion  How to Win Friends   Influence People is an exceptional book that you should read  I thoroughly enjoyed it and I feel that no matter who you are  you will enjoy it  too  It is more than just something to pass the time  it will have a lasting impact on your life  A great book that everybody should read  This book is filled with an enormous amount of wisdom for dealing with other people  Most of it is simply relational common sense  but presented like this  it serves as a good reminder for even the most  people smart  person  It is a must read for everyone  but especially leaders and those in the workplace  Why make everything so hard when you can easily and kindly find solutions that suit everyone  This book helps me when i was teen time   It s really right poin and good practice suggested   I recomment this book   Enjoy it   A classic  I love that Carnegie tells a story about a man from Rocky Mount  NC who attended one of his classes  this book was published in 1936  It s timeless  Very good book to anyone who are looking for improving their communication skills  I highly recommend this book  Wow  You might feel silly reading a book called  How to win friends     but wow  wow  Wonderful book  I didn t know what I had been missing  Full of wisdom and yet the title doesn t do it justice  It s simply a guide on how we may better love and encourage the people around us  The title came across as manipulative so I avoided it for many years  Having finally been convinced to read it  I regret missing out on this great read for so long and wish I d granted Mr  Carnegie some grace long ago  I could not recommend this book higher  The book has basic stuff that is worth reading ever so often   ktb mmtz jdan  n lt ml m  lns wfhm mtTlbthm bl Dfh l slwb lqS  lry   Bang on the mark  This was a re read for me  and I enjoyed it just as much as I had several years ago  I think that this should be required reading for everybody in the whole world  The only reason you shouldn t read this book is if you already have  You might think its not for you   I don t like non fiction or self help books  I prefer fiction and fairytales  But this book  You can t not learn something from it  Promise I ve read this book twice and will definitely go through it a third time once I graduate and begin embarking my career as an educator  Carnegie s lessons have stood the test of time  Some of the references are a bit dated but when you begin to input these rules into your daily life you immediately see a change in how people respond and treat you  I was recommended this book by a psychology professor that I greatly admired and though I wasn t much of a reader at the time  I couldn t put this down  In a world where most of us communicate via electronics today  I believe a book like this is even more necessary because those  common sense  lessons of how to deal with people are even less common nowadays  I would recommend this book to anyone  but especially anyone beginning a new career and entering or leaving the college world  I will recommend this book to all my future students   This is my absolute favorite book of all time  Totally applicable to almost any situation  Some of you might not now this or some of you do already know  If you don t then read it  if you do and you forget then read it again  I love this book  Not only is the advice in it superb but the audiobook read by Andrew MacMillan is a joy lot listen to  Using Carnegie s techniques  I can already see an improvement in my success in relations with others and get what I want more often with little added effort  Basically  Carnegie says what we should all strive toward  being extra extra kind no matter who we re dealing with  A classic I highly recommend  Easy to understand  aplicable  and interesting Must read  I think everyone has or should read this book   El principio mas profundo en el caracter humano es el anhelo de ser apreciado    Como ya lo he senalado  ese impulso es lo que nos diferencia de los animales  Es el impulso que ha dado origen a la civilizacion misma   The last 50 pages or so are just comic relief  but the first parts of this book are pure gold  I try to read it every couple of years  just so I can keep batting my eyes at you all while I steal your wallet  Jk jk  WHen my wife recommended this book to me  I thought   I m not desperate for friends   but there are great tips on how to be more personable  I highly recommend it  Carnegie is a genius and understands communication and basic human decency in ways that are lost on many  I wish everyone could read this book  but would recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their communication selling or arguing skills  2 things I always remember from this book  The sun can make you take off your coat more quickly than the wind  The only way to win an argument is to avoid one  Don t judge a book by its title  Horrible title  Great book  It s a  must read    One of the best books I ever read  This book was written decades ago  and it still rings true today  I believe that this book will still be guiding influencers decades from now  If I had any say in the educational system  I would enforce that every single high school and or college student read this  Everything Carnegie preached back in the 1930s is still so unbelievably relevant today  Such a groundbreaking and thought provoking novel that really changes the way you do business and how you should treat other human beings  Human decency  composure  and compassion is so important in everyday life  Carnegie did an amazing job of breaking it all down and simplifying how one should think and do business  5 stars doesn t seem enough   nice book Very profound and inspirational Very profound and inspirational This book has opened my eye in so many ways on how to deal with my business and personal life  Brilliant book  offering meaningful advice on personal interaction  Very powerful book  a lot of common sense things in here spelled right out  A book everyone should read at least once and revisit every few years   how a lot of people is going to try to screw you  would be a correct title for this book  while reading i recollected many instances when somebody tried to sell me something or make me do something using techniques from this book  definitely worth reading  Dale Carnegie is world renown  his perhaps most famous pupil was Charles Manson  who used it very effectively  as its mentioned in books about Manson  So here I am on Chapter 3   and I m thinking that this has to be one of the most phenomenal self help books ever written  Basically  it argues that if you earnestly invest in other people  care about them in ways that few people do  you will have success throughout your life  As many others have already commented  the name of the book leads you to believe that it will be a load of sleaze  And indeed  the book s title did put me off it for quite a while  After all  this is a book about how to influence people  For the most part  I haven t found the part of the book where the sleaze comes out  One thing I am wondering about however is how the book will address dealing with horrible people  with the tyrants  emotion terrorists  or just plain whiners  More importantly  the first rule  not criticizing anyone  That seems like it would take quite a toll after a while   I just finished reading this book and I must say that this is the first book that I know I can recommend to everyone I know  And I will do this  A big part of this book is full of examples from sales  but the principles from this book can be applied to every domain  every situation where you interact with other people  So many things inside this book seem common sense in our days  but you will be surprised while you read this book  how often you interact with people against your common sense and against the principles taught in this book The book is structured in four main chapters   Fundamental techniques in handling people  Six ways to make people like you  How to win people to your way of thinking  Be a leader  How to change people without giving offense or arousing resentmentThe chapters are packed with real life examples and the reading is fun  you really do understand why the people in the examples had problems and why  after changing their way of interaction with other people  the problems almost disappeared This book is an inspiration and the more people will follow it  the better or world and work environment will become  A must read
