A must for all leaders Social behavior explained  the only way to overcome fear of doing  is by knowing  because we only fear what we don t understand Loved the book  Dont waste your time with the audio book  very blah  It s just a classic    must read for everyone  I made my teenagers read it too  A classic  most of it isn t useful in today s world but still interesting  Not very long either  IN Chinese  old Chinese   I think some of the reviews to this book are unfair  They claim that there is everything in this book is common knowledge  I do not think that this is the case  And thinking  as a small business owner myself  applying this book to modern busines  or to modern world  in not as simple as  use deception when you can   There is much much more to it disguised by the simple writing style of this book  The important thing is  this is not a book to be browsed through  it should to carefully read in entirety to get a good idea  A must read   would absolutely recommend it to anyone for understanding the nature of conflict  The kind of slow cooker writing that can only be produced from centuries of people sitting around reviewing  refining   and recycling common sense  I have faith that if the Hoosier state  once world supplier of pragmatism  survives the current right wing ideological plague and finally learns to distinguish between  niceness  and collective passive aggression  why in a few centuries you ll be able to saunter into any IHOP and overhear a nearby booth of codgers as they hash over the fate of the soybeans  the dismal status of the American League s Central Division  or the weather  sound as with the pithy and plain as Sun Tzu  Lord  hasten the day  In the meantime I ll keep this most excellent book handy  It s one I plan on reading frequently  Required reading for leadership development BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN BY MAN I m always reading and re reading it  It provides insight for a lot of things in life  not  just  war  It can be applied to economics  house chores and more  xD I registered a book at BookCrossing com http   www BookCrossing com journal 13070044 The Art of War is a book worth reading simply because how you feel about it will determine what you actually know about literature and what makes a good book good In the day and age of Twilight we often neglect books that are more than fluff  We often refuse to see the nuances or the allegory employed by authors of old  We don t like absorbing the content of a book and trying to understand it as much we like being given everything in black and white The brilliance of authors of old was employing simplicity and leaving enough to the imagination  Growth from reading isn t about reading a bunch of words  anybody can read a bunch of words  Growth from books is simply about taking something that is as simple as sin in concept and growing from it Shakespeare didn t want you to read the words on paper or watch actors badly portray the characters he drew  He played with the simplest of concepts like anger  love and lust  He wasn t trying to make you aware of the existence of such concepts since you no doubt already knew of their existence  What Shakespeare was trying to do was to get you to think and explore what seems like the obvious but what is often neglected In the 21st century I suspect a lot of people would like to see The Art of War remade into a movie by Michael Bay with plenty of explosions  Unfortunately if you are looking for that in The Art of War or any great book then you are not going to get it The sheer genius of this book is the inherent simplicity  There are no battles or wars  certainly no explosions  In fact perhaps this book isn t even suited to being called the Art of War  For a book about war it certainly seems to advocate winning without a single battle if possible The Art of War engenders the warlike aspect of humanity and like any good book it doesn t teach you anything you wouldn t have known it just teaches you how to open your mind to things you are not thinking about  It s a book that will never get old  The book was most fascinating  With simple to complex military tactics  economic development and leadership  this book  I shall read again   I read this back in high school  but it didn t have much of an impact on me at the time for some reason  Reading it again with the benefit of many years of life experience  there are very few aspects of my life that wouldn t be improved by applying the lessons Sun imparts here  Essential reading for life  a new permanent read in my bookshelf I have wanted to read this book for years  I finally found a copy at Barnes   Noble that was inexpensive and fairly well translated The book is in two parts  The first part is the translation of Sun Tzu s  The Art of War   It is difficult to describe this as a book  It is more of a  laundry list  of ideas of what generals and leaders should and should not do during the course of fighting a war  That part runs about 51 pages  The second part is again the translation of  The Art of War  accompanied by several commentaries on the original book  Many sources are used  It seems to be fairly well researched  What I found astonishing is the stretch of time that this book encompasses   The Art of War  was written down sometime around 600 BCE  However  within the book itself are references as far back as 1700 BCE and some of the commentaries were written as recently as the 18th century CA Despite the incredible span of time this book covers  it is still relevant today  There has  of course  been much more added in terms of military tactics since 600 BCE  but what was relevant then  is still applicable now   This is definitely not something you read once  its more like a textbook   something you aught to read several times to unravel some of the more inconspicuous ideas Great Great Great book nonetheless  Uma fantastica licao de estrategia militar e de postura diante da vida  Essencial  A gem  The title says it all Excellent strategy   I don t know why I picked up this 15th century book except that it was free on Kindle  but I m so glad I did  It s not wordy  has so many great lessons that can translate from war into all areas of life  but my immediate thought when reading this common sense guide was   Why haven t American military leaders followed these principles   If they had  we wouldn t currently be a war in Iraq or Afghanistan  Sample this book  you ll be surprised how smart they were in the 1500 s  If you have never read this  stop whatever you are doing and get started now  This book can be applied to anything and everything you do in your life   no matter it be poker   your career   your day to day interactions or even that Thanksgiving family gathering you are dreading  Buy it   steal it   download it   whatever  But consume it   and consume it now  This is great even in audio book format  Possibly even better  Just a fyi  A timeless book  I try to pick it up weekly and read a random passage  Excellent advice that can be applied to any walk of life  Highly recommended I enjoyed that the author included commentaries  both ancient and new  from east and west  I believe that I enjoyed the examples of the text far more than just the text itself  Still studied today by military strategists  Sun Tzu s The Art of War is one of the oldest books detailing the strategies of conducting war  This is the book you just must to read once in your lifetime  Or twice    Yes  it is about war and strategies  but with a reason this book is a main litterature of many universites of economy or marketing in Japon and China  We are daily in conflicts  we you daily different strategies  techniques etc    Maybe in love  maybe in buissnes  maybe with your children using spies it is still a common thinkg  You learn a lot from this book     This is like trying to rate the bible  It is a masterpiece and should be read with a guide to gain further insights  Nearly every quote has had a war fought with it or an example of it being used in war  So much can be learned from this book for example many top executives and CEO s have it on their desk to make corporate decisions based entirely off Sun Tzu s principles and wisdom  mn  rw  lktb lty qr th  l  lTlq wlw kn l mr bydy lj lt mn lktb jz mhman mn mnhj t lym lnsh fy

random infos is ruling my business life  along with the Seth blog  The book is composed of 13 chapters  each of which focuses on a different aspect of war and one can use these 13 aspects in many areas of life like business management  office politics  sports  personal life etc  It s a smart and poetic book  Initially I was thinking what does an age old book about warfare and combat have to do with business or personal interactions  But later I found out that  The Art of War  is not about war so much as it is about the art of winning  Much of the text is about how to fight wars without actually having to do battle  It teaches us all the knowhow of facing life and its wars  This book is a gem in terms of knowledge and in terms of applicability to modern times Anyone can apply its concepts to many areas of life  Moreover one do not have to be in the military  or politics or business to benefit from the direction in this text  Its insights can be applied in any situation that needs resolution and works even in interpersonal quests As Sun Tzu quoted One who knows the enemy and knows himself will not be in danger in a hundred battles   it can be implemented as  business intelligence is crucial to learning the competitor s strengths and weaknesses and understanding one s own capabilities  It s the same what we calls nowadays SWOT analysis  Never fight a battle that you haven t already won  Definitely a key insight here is Plan before you execute  and be ready for all situations Every mantra of life i e  from keeping your cool  to being patient  to finding your opening always represent a tactic that when wisely applied can dictate a winning strategy  The lessons learned in this book can be allied to relationship  friendship  career and make you a more complete person in general  I recommend every person to read Art of War  it s a must read  Awesome book  a great read which took no time at all  loved it think every one should atleast check it out  This version of the book the first half is the original text  translated of course  After the complete text it then goes on to the second half in which it is the complete text again but is full of cliff notes  information  tacticts used that came from the text in actual wars  The always intriguing art of war is a must read for anyone interested in strategic studies and warfare  the always relevant principles embedded in the book show clearly the road towards victory  if followed correctly   badass This great book of war edifies the ambitious souls about the taoist way of living  while enriching the mind with the various methods to abide in order to win any war and destroy even an enemy  much more powerful than us  even before the battle takes place  it teaches to succeed a battle even by staying a million miles away from the actual arena  Thus  this book detest the bloodshed by weapons and direct confrontation with an enemy  but emphasis on the practical benefits of winning the war by deceiving the enemy through intelligent strategies and unshakable principles   my favorite book of all time  Es una guia de guerra que se puede tomar como una filosofia de vida  dura y cruel como la guerra misma  pero una filosofia This book is like a collection of Sudoku puzzles with all the values made relative  A mind expanding presentation of ancient wisdom applicable to any possible conflict  Conquest is not victory  Deception can be genuine  The absolute goal of  taking whole  invites the possibility of a world where egos needn t clash and victory needn t be costly  The translators provide cogent commentary and helpful notes for approaching a text usually hindered by its removal from our everyday understanding  All in all  a provoking exercise that can enhance the reader s view and relation to conflict  take a look at those strategies  it s worth Its a great book  Crazy to think his principals are still very applicable to today  Especially that his concepts exceed the boundries of war  Its almost  The Art of Strategy   Es un libro extraordinario  citado en miles de obras y reinterpretado de forma periodica  Una de las ediciones basadas en El arte de la guerra que mas nos ha gustado ultimamente es la de Juanma Roca  There are numerous translations out there  Be careful which one you choose  hdh lktb blnsb  l  y d tHf  fkry  f l  This is an excellent piece of literature that you can apply to your current everyday life and in turn learn a great deal from  I enjoyed every page and read it all the way through in one sitting anxiously awaiting the next piece of advice that lay ahead  This historical document was so enlightening for me  Sun Tzu  if he existed  of course  was so wise  When I was reading through it  I was thinking that it would certainly be a hard row to ever be on the receiving end of the of Sun Tzu s guidance  It is easy to see how  the art of war  could be applied to many different situations and aspects of life    sport  business  etc  etc  I never paid attention to how psychological war is    of course it is  There is something about timeless books that attract me  This was a delight to read   date i  read  this book is a bit misleading  i have my copy from 93 in my backpack  dog eared  hand written notes  hi lites  etc make this a very cherished possession  i can t necessarily relate what i learned from it as it s an on going learning process the ability to properly judge my opponent is the biggest takeaway   lHrb lyst dwm byn ljywsh if you know what i mean   The greatest victory is that which requires no battle   Just finished reading this  What an excellent book  I think I will probably read it a few more times until it completely sinks in   To know your Enemy  you must become your Enemy   Treat your men as you would your own beloved sons  And they will follow you into the deepest valley   at first it seemed very straightforward and logical and expected  but in some places i was surprised by the insight into human nature  habits  and motivations   Excellent     Not many books written for war time strategy can so easily be translated into a guide book for how to overcome struggles in life  While reading The Art of War  I could not help but see enemy armies as challenges that try to hold me back from success  I saw each strategy as a way to handle different obstacles that arise in day to day life  I recall this one time in particular where I applied the rules of combat from The Art of War  I was training at my martial arts academy and was partnered up with a much younger student at the time  I was trying to help him understand the point of maintaining a ready position so he would not hold a guard at only one position at a time  therefore leaving himself wide open elsewhere  I used a lesson from The Art of War to help him understand this idea  and by the end of practice he was doing much better  I would recommend this book to all age groups  men  and women  I feel that everyone who has an open mind can benefit greatly after reading The Art of War  This book was written hundreds of years ago and still maintains frightfully accurate information on how to handle yourself during war  I wonder if Sun Tzu intended his book to be so versatile on its potential for self help  I think that General Tzu was much wiser than people give him credit for  and that this book will remain on my shelf for years to come   My review refers to an  old  italian translation  L arte della Guerra  I find this book a masterpiece of strategy  centuries before Machiavelli For those who are familiar with  Marketing Management  by Philip Kotler you will find the first concept of SWAT analysis      Strong   Weak points  opportunities   threats       An artifact of its time  Sun Tzu s Art of War has transcended its initial uses as a manual for war tacticians into a manual for any variation of nonmilitary perceived warfare  especially within the realm of business  Having not read the original manuscript  it is difficult to know for certain if the translation has given the text an aura of self help feel or if Sun Tzu innovated much of the genre of self help over 2500 years ago  Either way  for a person who choses to take notes as one reads as opposed to reading it  dry   there is much to take away from the book dealing with management  the art of division  hypotheses of war effects on economies  etc  The beauty in Sun Tzu s philosophy blends elements of the Loazi s Taoism and business management that strikes the reader as altogether modern  as if it had been written for the Western world within a contemporary context  Once having studied it  the reader will not see the world entirely as she he had before  as all good books should do  and  ideally  she he will think more strategically about her his everyday interactions  I cannot make complete guarantees  but this is my conjecture as it currently stands  Since having read it  I see everything from chess and checker games to active shooter training in context of it  Perhaps the same will be true for you  Great book and tool for many aspects of life  Todas la personas que alguna vez me dijeron que este libro es necesario leerlo por lo menos una vez en tu vida acertaron  Veran este libro mas de ser una explicacion de como entrar en guerra y ser triunfante es aplicable en cada aspecto de la vida Me tomo unos meses leerlo  pero valio la pena y junto al mismo aprendi aspectos de mi que no conocia  Y dejenme decirles que tuve exito en aplicar algunos de estos pensamientos a la vida diaria  Un libro de estrategias  verdades y de un pensamiento aplicable si quieres afrontar con perfeccion cualquier situacion  Sin duda  una de las mejores lecturas del ano   Phenomenal     A classic  I gave this as a gift to my husband on his first deployment  We enjoy Asian themes and philosophy  and this is a must have in any collection   This was an interesting book   much shorter than I would have thought and much more of a narrative than I would have thought  I m sure I will come back to this book a few more times over the next year or two  My book review on the book THE ART OF WAR and what I thing and fell about it  The first thing I thought about this book was that it was very interesting  I have never read a book on how to take out another army in so many techniques and strategies  I was so festinated by the rules and laws that they had to go places and do certain things  That is the first reason why I like this book  The second reason why I like this book is because there are a lot of things you can learn from it  for instance it could tell you how to take you enemy out within a matter of time  Also it tells you how to take over your enemy s empire and turn it into you own to rule  Another interesting thing is that they will make sure they will win the battle before they even start the battle  If they did not plan out all of their battles then they could have lost and died  That is the second reason why I like this book The final reason why I like this book is because it is the most important of life and fighting style that we use today  Also because our ancestors would use this as a guide to lead them to victory in the war  Another cool thing that you can learn is how to sneak into the enemy empire to plan an attack for your army to come in  the last thing is that it is a great experience to read how armies would win their wars  That is why I like this book and the reason why I am doing my book review on it  yshrH ljnrl l Zym swn tzw fy shkl

soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much i learned a ton in this book  i will read this book a bunch of times  favorite quotes when do battle even if you are winning  if you continue for a long time it will dull forces and blunt your edge therefor those who win every battle are not really skillful those who render others armies are the best THE 5 SPYS IN WAR1 the local spy2 the inside spy3 the reverse spy4 the dead spy5 the live spy  Not something I thought i d enjoy  but christ this book is powerful  My book was very good educational and very easy to comprehend  It takes place in the warring era s of Asia  Middle East  Basically all it is Master Sun Tzu s ideals and beliefs of how to succeed using military strategies and is translated  explained by other war lords into their own perception  He explains the true art of warfare  what I mean by that is  Business  War  Chess  Football  Lax etc   The object is to win and only the person with the right strategies  mindset and follow through will win in all things I just mentioned  This book teaches you the art of warfare and has strategies and saying to which every military to this day uses  The best thing I took from this book is the power of control of your mind body and spirit  Knowledge from this book can be translated into everyday uses and has personally helped me  My favorite quote and probably one of his most famous quotes was  When Superior  Act Inferior  Now it took me a while to truly understand the depth of which this was written and when i go it my eyes were truly opened  What is said is not to show your hand  let people think youre weak so you re under estimated therefore you have an advantage  Even when you know you re superior let people explain to you why it is that they are right and you re wrong  empowering them gives them hubris which can ultimately lead to their demise  Thats what this book has taught me that s just one quote that i really took a liking to and theirs a book full of them  The Art of War is a book that should not only be read in order to properly understand how to wage war  but also how to travel through our daily life  El Arte de La Guerra es un tratado militar donde se muestran estrategias y pautas para conseguir la victoria en una contienda belica  El caso es que este manual se escribio hace mas de 2000 anos y aunque resulte impresionante todavia se muestra vigente  Lo mas interesante es que las tacticas que se muestran en este libro son aplicables a otros campos mas alla de la guerra  como pueden ser los negocios o el deporte  Muy recomendado  Important book to understand current organizations and top management behaviors  Way better than any leadership best seller  Easy to read  The concepts are presented logically and completely  Provides the basic theories of combat    So it is said  Know the enemy  Know yourself  And victory Is never in doubt  Not in a hundred battles      The Art of War by Sun TzuIt a wonderful book  Of course  it s a piece of literature that s survived 2 500 years and people still quote it  so if I were to trash it I wouldn t count anyway  But its great  whether taken literally  if you re a soldier general etc  or if taken metaphorically  The latter is the way I read it  of course  I ve been going through some things and honestly  The Art of War is better than any self help book  If only because I d read this and there s no chance in hell you d catch me with a self help book  Anyway  find yourself a copy  read it  pass it around   This is a regular read for me  It stays in my desk drawer and I read it at least every other month  It s not about  fighting     it s about  winning   Sun Tzu teaches you how to win without fighting and THAT is great wisdom The application of this book will touch every aspect of your life  It will make you a better parent  more successful employee  better spouse  and better neighbor I have an earlier edition of this same author but it s the same content  Prilichno

podumat  tam est  nad chem  Itog  10 iz 10  It s a classic  a self help book and a good read all rolled up into one  The Art of War  by Sun Tzu   is one of the most interesting books I ve read in a long time  The book expresses the importance of strategy within war  as well as using your surroundings to your advantage  The book speaks of different constants that happen as well as rules to follow  Much of the book speaks of suggestions  One of the many  rules  you should follow are not to engage you re enemy when he has the higher ground  This can be taken literally or metaphorically  There are many of these  rules  and  laws  that you are to battle by  but the book also describes what the perfect balance is in how to lead  or what a leader should be like  as well as what a soldier should be  I found the book to be very helpful and it read out to sound very wise  It makes you feel smarter when reading it  I don t think it was for my age group  but I enjoyed it nevertheless  I would not recommend the book to those who are very self centered  nor to people who care not for strategy  However  I highly recommend the book to those who enjoy strategy   Sun Tzu  What Kind of War Will You Lead Today I postponed reading   Sun Tzu  s book   The Art of War   several times  I wasn t very sure that this is the kind of lecture I was looking for  After reading it  I discovered impressive ideas and timeless advices in The Art of War written by Sun Tzu    more Profound The Art of War is a must read for almost anyone  Particularly good for managers of people  coaches and those who want to understand how to work better as a team   Master Sun say  I know I know  another MBA reads the Art of War  It s not all Gordon Gecko folks  It s a beautiful look at our world and how to approach life  Understanding your adversary and the lay of the land is a way to good living  It s all very literal  but the metaphors are all solid truth  You simply must read at some point  A lifetime is made up of the daily wars that must be faced squarely and won graciously  Wars are usually dreaded and looked at with fear  But thanks to the wise advice of Sun Tzu  we need not fear wars  We must simply know the art of war and surely we will win it even before it begins  The Art of War is a classic    always timely and forever timeless  This is a must read for everyone because no one is ever spared from waging some kind of war   Everyone should read this It tells you as much about motivation and human compunction than any other book Ive ever read  This should be required reading for teachers  businessmen  cops  everyone that every has to deal with a group of people in a possibly hostile setting  27      Spies are the most important element in war  because on them depends an army s ability to move   Master Sun  Sun Tzu  I listened to this on CD  and if I m being completely honest  one reason I picked it up is that I wanted something I could finish in December to add to my list of books read in 2009  and this was only 2 CDs long  Also  though  I have always wanted to read it  It was excellent  I think the most likely criticism I could imagine hearing is that it s just a bunch of very basic military tactics  which it is  but the fact that this one work is really the grounds on which generations and generations of leaders have based their strategy is pretty impressive  This book is 2400 years old  And all of the strategies and theories are fully applicable today  both on the battlefield or in any other sort of adversarial setting  This is the basis for all of the business strategies that we ve come to accept today  It might have been a little dense or boring to just sit down and read it  but the CDs were excellent  Love this book  I read this book every year or so to keep a clear head   Fantastic book about dealing with life properly Day 1 middle  page 29   So far the book has talked about how to prepare an army for combat and plan out the battlefield and the route and strategies along with what to do in a desperate or planned retreat  It has also revealed the common weak points in an army  or how to spot one and how to deal with one  I predict that the book will  chances are  talk about the types of situations to do what and its alternatives as it has not briefed on that yet  and should be an important factor Finished  The book has talked on the different types of terrain to avoid or put it to your benefit  and the different cases your army could get into  and what to do in that case  It has talked on how to use fire in war properly and the procedures  Lastly the uses of spies and their importance in the army  Overall  the book specifically states all the possible situations and precautions one should take to ensure victory  This is the book for all the general s needs and to lead him on to victory  Quite strangely the strategies in the book has even helped me in my strategy war game I recommend this book to anyone looking for pro strategies in a strategy game  or to any fan of history I picked up this book when I was browsing the online book store and found this book on it  while I could not find a copy anywhere else  so got the book in curiosity of strategies used in war I finished this book because of the strategies he used and the strategies to come and of plain curiosity  The absolute classic  l  lrGm mn qdm hdh lktb l nh y d mrj an fy lfnwn lHrby  wtq ydan lHkm lHy  wlt ml m  lns  Epic  Not any other way I can explain it  Just be prepared to have your mind twisted  Wonderful edition  lots of art and commentary  really good book A masterpiece of Eastern philosophy  Applicable to so much more than just military tactics if you have the slightest imagination  The introduction by Nigel Cawthorne gives slight detail about Sun Tzu and the history of the text  The uncredited afterward  How Sun Tzu s Strategies Can Help In Business And Other Areas  is a lovely bonus section  pointing out the book s influence on recent military  business  marketing and culture This particular edition is worth tracking down just for the binding  The book itself is wrapped in rich  red satin with gold foil inlay  and then boxed in a sturdy  hard case  Every page of the book is beautifully illustrated  If you re going to keep a copy of this on your shelf  this is the version to have  This book is the bible for any warrior  Often recommended for trial attorneys  It is my work bible  Given the importance of warfare as a factor that drove human civilization since its inception  and given the stellar reputation that the art of war has accrued for itself over the centuries  I find it remarkable that such an important treatise could be   well   short  Succinctly written  simple without ever being simplistic  the art of war stands the test of time as one of the greatest philosophical works known to mankind  Far from being a weakness  its brevity is its greatest strength   the important lessons of war condensed into practical ideas that never become over complicated   a vital lesson hard won from the fires of battle  Who was Sun Tzu  We shall never know  but his universal truths regarding warfare shall forever be known  studied  modified and adapted  because for as long as humans abound  war will follow in their wake   I like this book because it is descriptive and it includes a lot of military strategys and is good for grades 7 12 nice book Not only is this a must read for any tactician  it s good for everyone  This ancient text can be applied to everyday psychology  What is in your control  what is out of it  How do you prepare yourself for an opponent and how to assess your opponent without demonizing them hence providing yourself with more accurate information in which to go to battle  that s a book to re read in need  The initial main take away thoughts were the necessity of information and avoidance   management of conflicts  I might re read some chapters in more details and putting more thought if I need to recall some ideas perspectives  My favorite book  a short read and an ancient classic  It was written as a basic guide on warfare tactics but can also be applied to the business world   Sun Tzu s The Art of War  Oxford University Press  1963  197  Originally written in 500 BCE and translated by Samuel B  Griffiths   is one book that has inspired several other books  It s been applied to various fields from business to friendship and more  In this book  Sun Tzu discusses what a good General should do if he is to win wars  The discusses almost everything that one needs to do and know about war and its effects from war induced inflation to food shortages that accompanies it read the rest here http   freduagyeman blogspot com 2012    It is really an art  and it can be used in management and business  The Griffiths translation is the best  A classic I re read at least once a year    Strongly recommended for everyone  The scenarios and language are dated  still the psychology of winning  always  in an honorable way is captured extraordinarily  A book written about war strategy became corner stone for management professionals  Written almost 3 millenia ago whole book is still valid no matter where you want to apply it  be it war  management or self success  Intensely loved and respected and very equally panned  The Art Of War stands as one of the finest look at management and strategy Although many of its ideas may seem very commonplace and trivial  the beauty of the text lies not in following it to its word  but adapting and interpreting it as one s context Highly recommended to people having a taste for management and strategy  on the front of my edition  it says it s the most influential strategy book in the world  I didn t read that until I realized how good it was though I think this book is a classic because of it s flexibility  There are some parts where he speaks about geography that are applicable only in battle situations  unless you are running away from something  in which case it is handy to think about them   but there were sections where I was seeing parallels between what he was saying and strategy in an activist campaign For being so short  like many Chinese classics  it needs a lot of thought  He offers very realistic and ethical strategies  Some we probably already know  some we haven t thought about  I don t want to spoil anything since it s so short  but I definitely recommend reading it  It s very worthwhile  For sure  take notes on the side on how they can be applied to different contexts  Some things which he seems to say are  Protect your own Hide your intentions Be adaptable A good general  leadership  is crucial Do not obey orders if they do not make sense Sometimes alliances are needed Be kind to your enemies Spies are neededHe also classifies a lot of things that will make the reading easy and at the end he joins some things together in a sort of summary which I appreciated   Listened to this as read by Aidan Gillen aka Littlefinger  OMG  Succinct   excellently useful  not just on the battlefield  but so much more with the reading  It s well worth the hour it takes to listen to a master schemer convey to you this ancient wisdom   Really like this book  I re read it every couple of years  One of the great classical works  Many believe that the subject of this work pertains only to war  sports  and business  Yet this work provides insight to relationships   This book has given me more wisdom than literally any book on our literacy class in high school  Just make sure you get a good copy with simple translation  because there are the ones with couple of translation for every verse  chinese language is complicated so is the translation   but to many different translation lose the meaning and point of sun tsu  trust me hia military version original translation is enough if you dont understand that  this book is not for you but if you have this general culture and understanding of how the world works   this will be an ultimate enlightment for you  if you haven t  read it  right now  I could read this over and over again  Required reading  Sun Tzu was the master of war philosophy  He doesn t the best stretagist   the general  politician or scholar  but he can collect and develop  ideal  and  logic of WU  war or fight  until them still have influence and can adapt for modern world  He was the best of master theorogist and war philosophy   and he can use them to success for the war in the era of chaos The best theory and logic of art of war  well it not winning forever  But it wasn t defeat  This is a classic military read that any good soldier would be embarrassed not to have read  Sun Tzu s strategy  tactics and intelligence concepts are applicable to many walks of life  It is a quick read but has lots of great stuff in it  nice Many applications  straightforward yet extremely meaningful reading  I liked it very much  Much like situational leadership  important decisions are to be based on the context  Sun Tzu had war as the back drop for this  Otherwise  it s essentially adaptable to other situations  Fascinating study of the principles of war and engagement of the enemy in ancient China with many applicable ideas to today  I wonder if our military strategists and tacticians are required to study it  I would assume so  Sun Tzu is simply a bad ass  He understands human nature and how to conquer anything and anyone by using that understanding wisely  It s good advice for living  and not just for those who are bent on conquest   It s not really about war  it s about knowing yourself and how you handle situations  It is very helpful and could be applied in one s life  Any area in life could be answered by this book  It teaches you to always think 3 steps ahead and to know your surroundings  Very philosophical and truly tactical I read this book once along with the Prince       If I had one word to describe this book  it would be  Classic   If I had two words to describe the Art of War they would be  Classic strategy   and with three words I would throw Military between the two  However and most unfortunate for my readers I have more then three words to describe it and will now proceed to use that liberty  It is a book that all young men should read early in life as well as often  Even if they cannot fully grasp the better part of Sun Tzu s meaning in his masterful work  As they get older they will learn the full concepts of the strategies that Sun Tzu puts forward  and grow up  as did I as a fan of this ancient book  But in essence I mean to say it is never to early for an army man loving  action figure playing  toy gun marksmen of a young man  to read  or have someone read him  The Art of War  By  Sun Tzu  This is one of my all time favorite books  Not to be read in a day of even two  it is not a book that will have you reading it long into the night  for by that time  unlike with most other books your mind will be far to tired to comprehend the full depth of what Master Sun is saying in the  greatest classic military strategy book of all time   Robert L D CLR You can apply these lessons to any battles you are fighting  coworkers  neighbors  actual wars  If you approach your life from the Art of War perspective  you will succeed   The ultimate guide book for politically inclined individuals  Must read         This is a guide for generals and rulers but Sun Tzu managed to write a guide for everyday life  Kudos you ancient military genius  What many who take this work literally don t understand is that it is essential reading for strategic business development and the winning of market share in one s particular field of commerce  It has been quoted at many a sales strategy development meeting  in a metaphoric sense  One of my favorite books       Often quoted  seldom read  A great book to help establish a new state of mind if you are looking to become more extroverted  Examples are clear and precise and applicable to most situations still today  Don t worry so much about the commentary  Just read the thirteen chapters   This really is a must  Set out in a number of one liners or small proverbs over thirteen chapters  I opted for the Griffith interpretation from 1963 as it s quite easy to comprehend  Blair and Bush should have read this before going intro Iraq  In fact the USA should have read it before Vietnam as alot of it is common sense  I really liked this book  The military stragies that Sun Tzu talks about were awesome  I would have hated to have been the general who had to go against this guy  Perhaps the greatest chinese general of all time  Sun Tzu talks about military strategy and defeating your oppenents  Sun Tzu s advice does not only apply to war but daily life and ways to get around your obstacles  I thought this book was great in teaching advice because of the different sections describing details about the sub topic  Get this book  Best strategy of life book My personal favorite good read  I like Machiavelli s  The Prince  more than this  With the knowlage from this book I will one day rule the world  For now though  I will use it to rule AP World History class  Recommended to   Political and social sciences students   Military People Obligatory reading if you are a philosopher  lawyer  psychologist  economist  politician  historian and of course military  Basically  if you are a student scholar of the social sciences field   you no doubt must know about this book  also probably one of the biggest marks in chinese culture and civilization  A fascinating treatise dealing with all forms of  the art of war  Although credited to Sun Tzu the version I had mentions many interpretations  commentators and amendments so in fact I find it very hard to decide WHICH parts are the actual work of the accredited author Although apart from that the whole work was very interesting  although as intimated by the title it is to do with military warfare SOME of these hints and tips can be applied in real life such as  know your enemy  this kind of practicality can also be applied in real life Sieges  tactics  provisions  prisoners  interaction with the armies and officers all topics are covered Overall a great  interesting read that will appeal to practically anyone who has an interest in the great classics as this is not just a daunting military epic that might put potential readers off  There is no better collection of filtered  concise wisdom on war  This book makes sense on so many levels  and I can see why it s a work of study for so many people around the world  This is a book I plan to reread many times over  The part that sticks in my mind the most is the idea of practicing the moral law  If more leaders would employ this in the U S   we would have a much stronger nation   This book is really interesting that I would recommend to other people to read  It has really interesting tactics that are currently used in the U  S  Military  However  it also explains  many tactics used in modern wars such as the civil war  World War I and World War II and the Vietnam war  Many tactics are even used in sports such as basketball soccer and even American football  It s a great book  that would give you the history of major wars and how the weaker won the stronger and how slaughter doesn t matter in war  as long as you don t under estimate your opponent  It will give you a much more understanding about how countries won wars with the littlest military power   The Art of War teaches the way an honorable and smart general leads his troops into battle and the measures that he has to take to be the victor  From this book  I learned how to take the battlefield that Sun Tzu talks about in his book and to apply it to the business world and to the world of academic achievement  They are both battles and if you have the right tools and the proper direction  you can definitely win the battle   A must  hrkhh nkhwndh nym  mrsh br fnst  hrkhs Hl nkhwnd tmm  mrsh br fnst  Bet me  its a masterpiece  I read this book when I was a young trial lawyer and periodically throughout my 30 year career  It makes so much more sense after gaining experience  I strongly suggest that anyone in a competitive field read and re read this book every few years  It lives up to it s reputation  Powerful read  Excellent book on leadership and strategy  Time has tested these lessons and they prove true One of those books that I thought would be boring  but what a surprise  my granddaughter was reading it as part of her honors program at Az State and I read it to see what they were doing in the class  Highly recommended to all  The first two chapters was an awe for me  It opened my eyes Its a good book  For every person who studies self  history and combat an essential part of your education  A must read  Great  sentences  about strategies not just for war  but in life also  A great classic     Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy s resistance without fighting   Treat your men as you would your own beloved sons  And they will follow you into the deepest valley    To win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill  To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill  Simply  such book should be taught in classrooms   wonderful  it applies to all forms of relations in life  not just to war situations   Fascinating look at the strategy of war and plans for success  El mejor libro de estrategia que jamas leeras  Aplicable a cualquier tipo de conflicto  Lastima que los conflictos aun deban ser resueltos de esta manera  Mi biblia  Possibly the most ground level book on conflict ever written  I don t know if success has been put on paper in a more perfect fasion  This was absolutely brilliant  I wasn t so sure it would actually be an enjoyful read but I was proved wrong  The Art of War really helped me understand conflicts and also general decision making  if I m going to be honest here  I loved it and I m sure I ll use it as a reference for many situations in my life  It s probably my favourite book of all time  I know I say that about a lot of books but if it were a competition this would definitely make the top of the list  It s short and easy to read and very poetic  It s hard not to love This book isn t only for warfare  It s the basis for all my personal and business relationships  Works well for business  not so well for romantic relationships  Art of War  which I am against  This is a classic book that all should read once in their lives  Filled with pieces of wisdom that carry through the ages and can help those of us living today as much as it would have helped those living in Sun Tzu s era  If you are at all interested in leading others or bettering yourself  I would recommend reading this  Re reading a leadership classic  O maior tratado de guerra de todos os tempos em sua versao completa em portugues   A Arte da Guerra  e sem duvida a Biblia da estrategia  sendo hoje utilizada amplamente no mundo dos negocios  conquistando pessoas e mercados  Nao nos surpreende ve la citada em filmes como Wall Street  Oliver Stone  1990  e constantemente aplicada para solucionar os mais recentes conflitos do nosso dia a dia  Conheca um dos maiores icones da estrategia dos ultimos 2500 anos  This book  should be called how to deal with your enemies  It tells you how to one up defeat and outwit without lifting a finger  I really love this book    this book seems like a strategy to win war    but its a book for business    in making strategy against competition    I didn t read this particular translation  but some of the others I have read have been excellent  interspersing Sun Tzu s words with the words of his contemporaries  as well as generals that came after him  My favorite started with an extensive history of the times of Sun Tzu  Il manuale di guerra piu famoso del mondo non ha bisogno di molti commenti  Al giorno d oggi  usato nella vita quotidiana e nel mondo del lavoro  dovrebbe essere letto da tutti almeno una volta nella vita  The wisdom of ages is unparalleled  Timeless and sound  The current influences of tech wizardry rob the world of great thinkers  great strategists and great philosophers  Maybe it s time to put down the gadgets and bow in reflection  A fantastic piece that transcends time and space  A must read Simply the best book ever  Best translation I ve read of The Art of War  but definitely a must have to understand the geopolitical context in which it was written  This book you should read  re read and absorb the timeless principles adopted and applied by the brilliant strategist of all times  Sun Tzu  Pronounced Sun Soo     The Art of War  by Sun Tzu is probably one of the most interesting reads for all ages  Despite the title  the reader can walk away from this work with more than just war tactics  Though the book centers on ancient warfare methods  one can find themselves applying particular methods to every day situations  The book offers tips for being prepared for success in any situation and that can apply to school  work  or any other personal complications that someone may face   Sun Tzu divides the book into thirteen chapters  the first being  Laying Plans   which explains how a commander can calculate his chances of victory   Waging War  explains how to understand the economy of warfare and how to make decisive engagements quickly   The Plan of Attack  defines the source of strength as unity  not size  and discusses the five factors that are needed to succeed in any war  attack  strategy  alliances  army  and cities  The remaining chapters are all equally informational and really explain matters such as tactics  directing orders  spotting weak points and strengths  and maneuvering resources as well as creating variations in plans and tactics   These guidelines are all extremely helpful for any situation that life may throw out at a person and it was a fun and easy read  It was interesting how such ancient tactics can still be used in multiple situations even today  I would definitely recommend this book to all ages because it s helpful to see ideas and tactics that have been proven successful for difficult situations at any age   The Art of War is a primer of military history  The Art of War is on the professional reading lists of the world s military officers  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the study of politics and war  Don t let your enemies know what you think of this book  P    Timeless principals  Break the connection to  War  and you have a text which is foundational to the messages found in Geoff Moore s Crossing the Chasm  ynj brrsy tTbyqy khrdmhttp   codeshodegan iautnb com 2011 0    Great book In researching the subject of military strategy for my fantasy series  War of Whispers   I felt compelled to read this masterpiece  Despite being written so long ago  I was amazed at the relevance of Sun Tzu s work  primarily pertaining to military motivation  strategy  and tactics  A must for anyone interested in military history  Brilliant and pithy  I think reading this improved my Go game by 2k  This is not my first time reading this book  I read it again for the sake of this review  The author of the original manuscript is the Sun Tzu and the translator for this version is Lionel Giles  The genre is military history and of course the title of the book fits in very well with the reading  The version I have is the one from Barnes and Noble classics  All chapters of the without commentary amount to 72 pages but the book has commentary included and the total amount of pages comes to 273 My curiosity for originally reading this work came from the general impression that this book can be applied to all facets of life  not just war  Businessmen for example have been reading this book to apply it to their dealings with others  This book  if you are focused  is a very quick read  Like I previously stated  the book covers all chapters within 72 pages  However the material is rehashed with commentary for in depth study  There are so many memorable quotes from the text  We all know the famous line  All warfare is based on deception   I would love to add more but it would be a lot more fun to read the book for yourself and pick the quotes that you like the most  Giles does a great job with the organization of the text it really is a joy to read If I had to pick an arena of life where this book is most applicable I would say it would be sports  In the chapters  Attack by Statagem  and  Tactical Dispositions  the book mentions the way of the truly skillful fighter  When I read the chapter I immediately thought of a boxer  planning a way to beat his opponent  The book appealed to me in both a logical and emotional way  I saw the sense in Sun Tzu philosophy when he is dealing with both war strategy and tactics  It also captured my imagination on how I can apply the principles in a sport like setting  Although the book is used for business strategy  I find it a stretch  Maybe 10  to 15  of the material can be used for business  In age of transparency  the deception model of business transactions do not work  Also business is about profit which can be earned with or without direct competition whereas in sports and in war victory is the goal and there is always an opposing force  I highly recommend this book  It is only  4 95 from Barnes and Noble and even cheaper if you can get it online   Timeless principles that undergird life in all its stages and direct battle with deadly ferocity    DAB This must read classic is not just about the principles of war  but the principles of life  It is an easy read and a short one  but don t let it s brevity deceive you   the ideas and philosophy it lays out are deep  rich  profound and not mined in one read  This is a Reader s Corner Highly Recommended book and one you must read before you die  It is rated 10th grade due to the depth of content even though it can be read by much lower readers   Not a book to read once while drinking coffee   Inspirational  Read it four times and will do so again and again  Principles and strategies needed for life and to handle situations        A must read Classic strategy manual  Very direct  and very timeless  No man should go through life without reading this book at least 3 times Managers who keep this book on their desk should be thrown off of a bridge  Having said that  if you have a penis or simply enjoy winning at everything this book should be mandatory reading  This book does not only describe military battles  but also battle in life  The application to real life situations is incredible and should not be discarded  The ultimate strategical guide to wartime  it is such an inspiring essential book for every one concerned with developing strategies   not only in battle fields but also in daily life situations and i have seen a psychological points in the book which can be used to understand the human behavior   also strategies of negotiations can be deducted from the context   I consider to read it again and again till i feel that i completely absorbed it    This book is a holistic approach  with ideas and practices that cover a large range of activities  mug bueno Excellent collection of ancient war notes  Profound  seminal  What more can I add  except to say that James Clavell s foreward is in itself a worthwhile essay on the context  very insightful  will continue to read for years to come  A great insight into the mind of a legend  These values can be transfered to other relevant areas I read this one every year  and get a little more out of it each time  This timeless  poetic collection of military aphorisms is deservedly a classic  In addition to its value as a work on strategy  it s a damned good guide to dealing with human beings in general  As with any work of genius  multiple readings are necessary even to get an inkling of what Sun Tzu was writing about  Learning to apply his principles is even more challenging  My favorite version so far  and I admit that I m biased  as I like the publishing company  is the Shambhala Dragon Edition  translated and edited by Thomas Cleary  Cleary s translation contains commentary by later strategists such as Cao Cao and Wang Xi  I don t think it s possible to grasp even the mid level application of Sun Tzu s principles without a basic familiarity with the Tao Te Ching   another work that requires a lifetime of study  Many editions are available  but I prefer the Shambhala edition  translated by John C F  Wu  Wu was is fluent in both English and Chinese  and his version includes the Chinese text alongside the English translation  The definitive work on strategy  Sun Tzu s ideas can be applied to every war and nearly every conflict  How Asia conducts warfare     Just about every single line is worth favoring  with much in it for reflection and  as a metaphor  for practical application beyond the battlefield  I can see why business majors love this book   From the world s first military strategists  his lessons are timeless and give insight to what the Western world should know understand about how China probably still looks at warfare and strategy  Undoubtedly the most useful written work I have ever read Its wisdom applies to every facet of human interaction  all contexts  and likely for all time  Every time I find myself at a loss for maintaining momentum and dominance in conflict resolution  I consult Sun Tzu  If I m unsure how to proceed when striving to impress a person in a particular way  I re read  The Art of War   Should I fail to develop a protocol for getting what I want out of any given situation  I ll find what I need in this classical treatise on strategy Sun Tzu breaks the battlefield down into its most basic components  and explores the roles each play to either victory or defeat  He was an astute psychologist long before Freud and the Viennese Schools ever existed  tapping into inexorable truths of human thinking and behavior alongside observation of history to derive his conclusions  All of his indicated observations of warfare can be transposed to virtually any scenario that can exist between people  I ve come to find his wisdom applying to intrapersonal matters as well  particularly in defeating anxiety  despair  fear  doubt  and insecurity I wouldn t attempt any kind of negotiation  investment  pursuit  or a romantic conquest without finding its equivalent situation in this book  Yup   The Art of War  is the most useful work one can consult when dating  too  not joking   The classic how to fuck with people handbook I m not to sure why I didn t review this earlier  to be honest it isn t a book  well not a fiction one at that Anyway The Art of War is written by Sun Tzu  Sun Tzu was an ancient Chinese military general  strategist and philosopher who is traditionally believed  and who is most likely  to have authored the Art of War  an influential ancient Chinese book on military strategy The Art of War is one of the oldest and most successful books on military strategy in the world  its teachings still used in war today  a few of its most famous quotes are  He who knows when he can fight and when he cannot will be victorious  To know your Enemy  you must become your Enemy and Victorious warriors win first and then go to war  while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win The Art of War is a very inspiring book  which I would guess would mostly appeal to boys  so I recommend this to those who are interested in it    Should be titled  common sense   somehow  it s still profound though  Like a complex decision tree  How many of these points has the US military violated the last 5 years   Hint  a

batalla Leerlo  y releerlo es una actividad obligada  A great translation of the Art of War  Recommended to anyone interested in the art of war  This book is a book of life  It may have a title suggesting to war tactics but it is several life lessons but into a collection  I personally think Sun Tzu wrote this both for war and other concerns  Such as business and politics  or something as small as an everyday problem  This book has opened my heart  body  and soul to many things  The book is somewhat repetitive but for good reason  It would do well to remember  He who is wins knows when to fight and when not to   and to know that this can be used for all things  This Is the best version of The Art of War of the four I read  The author makes it very clear so one can adapt it to their situation   Celui qui n a pas d objectifs ne risque pas de les atteindre   My rating is based on the number of times I have read the English versions of this awesome work  I am thrilled to finally have una edicion en Espanol  it was an amazing book  i read the translate in arabic to get a better understanding and more benefit from it it can help you think in more strategies for everything  you can apply these ideas in so many field   life is a war and you need an art to live it right    I am at the hospital and this book got my interest because I feel like fighting a war and I want to succeed  I want to win this fight and recommend it for everyone who doesn t feel well or is passing through a hard time of their lives but now I will no longer talk about me and begin talking about the book How was the book  The book The Art of War is about a war in china translated and the book was written by Sun Tzu because he was the commander those times and to understand it I will summarize it  The first 150 pages contain a summary history of China leading up to the time when the book was written and explains the context in which the book was written  In these pages he explains the types of weapons  armor  vehicles  agriculture  political organization of the time period  The book itself as the story is about 80o pages  In the  story  he explains the strategy and tips and how was the war The last major section is the end notes to the first 250 pages  This section is about 80 pages long but the text is MUCH smaller than the rest of the book and leaves very fewer blank pages or gaps  It probably amounts to 100 150 pages if made the same text size as the rest of the book What was it about The art of War is a book about warfare  It happened centuries ago in China where Sun Tzu explains how the landscapes  unity  freedom  strategy  harmony restriction danger security distances were important for war because Sun Tzu believed that war can be defeated before starting it because the commanders need to plan everything and have to prepared to win  Then Sun Tzu explains the war and how to manage the plan depending the situation  Giving the reader tips Who should read The Art of War   The art of war  is a must read for anyone who wants to be successful  You don t become successful by reinventing the match  You become successful by imitating success and understanding the match why something is successful and adapting those rules to your actions  Sun Tzu said it best in the book with the best words  the battle is won before the sword is drawn   This quote is powerful and it is true when you reflect about war  My paragraph above is simplified in this quote  Read this book  keep it  as I have as a reference source to be successful in life and then reread it every time you want to accomplish something and this book will let you to success  There are many useful examples of how more was accomplished with less  One of book that inspired me the most  Sun Tzu s The Art of War could be used as a business manual  is profound  and can teach you how to crush the opposition with little or no resources  Some people miss the modern day application of this book  Though useful as a war manual  required reading  and studied at West Point Military academy  even today its philosophies are still as true as the day they were written  The Art of War in my opinion most likely influenced Sherman in his legendary march during the Civil War  In business the philosophy of dividing the competition and getting them to misuse expenditures  their research and development money  misappropriate their advertising  and using their Goliath strength against them and in your favor is the golden thread which has graced the robes of the shrewdest business man  Sun Tzu beat armies outnumbered 30 to 1 and took cities and provinces without a fight  Business that use such tactics end up on top  The trick in war or business is to get your opponent to respond in a way that is contrary to his best interests to expend money and manpower in order to defend what did not need defending  To get your business opponent to support movements of his company in counterproductive expensive activities  this kind of attack cost nothing and is not illegal  You can read The Art of War in an evening and spend months thinking about its application  Five stars is not enough   A very insightful read  especially if you apply the teachings beyond the obvious military aspects  What do I think about this book  First  It s a timeless classicSecond  Too many tacticians from the past and present have read itThird  To understand it fully I need to read it more than a hundred times This book is a must read for everyone  I read this while going though a divorce and it kept me sane   There is a reason this book is a classic  It is amazing and I will certainly be rereading it many  many times  There nothing like learning from the same book that has been highly utilized by so many great men throughout history  It is a very short read  took me about an hour  but it is time well invested   One of my favorite books  This was actually required reading in one of my classes in law school  But I ended up getting my own copy  as I loved to re read certain passages  It is not just applicable in armed combat  but also in everyday life   very good book  All leaders should read it  no need to be at war  life is filled with little battles which all must fight  many of these war tactics are perfect analogies for today s common people s problems  Most books I read every day are not more than 400 years old  and I believe that others  preferences do not fundamentally differ in this case  That s I think quite normal because these books are authentic and are easy to read  as we are not experiencing any problems with vocabulary and the context itself  So  what if I give you a 2500 year old book  You ll probably not want to read it  as you ll think that the vocabulary is difficult  and the content is  well   old   That s not the case with Sun Tzu  The Art of War First of all  who was Sun Tzu  He was a famous Chinese general  strategist and philosopher whose military texts were very popular during the Zhou dynasty  But  The Art of War  had a completely different destiny  The military text written 2500 years ago is nowadays known all over the world  The Vietnamese soldiers knew Sun Tzu by heart and used the tactics described in a 2500 year old military text during the 20th century  A Japanese general Takeda Shingen fought in a war without using guns  because he relied on Sun Tzu s tactics  Most Western companies only employ people for the position of CEO if they have read  The Art of War   We can already anticipate many things about the book by these facts  The Art of War  is a non fiction book  It doesn t have any storyline  It consists of 14 chapters  each of them filled with independent statements  which are useful pieces of advice about war by Sun Tzu  The book isn t very long  yet it contains a lot of important information  Each chapter speaks about a certain aspect of war  For example  the first chapter is about laying the plans  how we should plan our attacks and by what factors we can estimate our future failure or success  The book contains a lot of philosophy  The most interesting thing is the fact that Sun Tzu s strategies are used not only in the realm of military  but also in business  communication  international relationships and in many other realms  Don t think that the book is filled with instructions about how to fight in the war  Sun Tzu mostly persuades us to avoid conflict if possible  and to capture the army instead of destroying it  Also  the book is filled with very  tough  quotes  The quotes like  All warfare is based on deception  became so popular that most of the people who know these quotes don t even know that they are from  The Art of War   The vocabulary of the book is very easy  I mean  it can t be that you ll know every single word from the book  but you ll easily understand the meaning of every single sentence  that s for sure  That s quite strange for a book which was written 25 centuries ago  We should say thanks to Lionel Giles  who carefully translated the book from the original Chinese into English in 1910 and managed to keep the philosophy and meaning of the book unchanged   My review is based on Giles  translated version  Reading  The Art of War  is absolutely not boring  Every part of the book is completely unique and different from the other parts  You ll probably never read a book like  The Art of War   Not that it s the best book in the world  I can t say that  But it s unique by its age  it s unique by its way of expressing ideas  it s unique by the arrangement of the information in the context  it s unique by its information  We can even leave out the positive sides of the book because it is so popular all over the world that I think every person should read it in any case  Nobody will be disappointed  Wonderful box  a classic on warfare strategies that are timeless and beneficial in the corporate world today I read  The Art of War  out of pure curiosity  I don t have anything to do with war  I m not a soldier or anything like that  But I found this book really good  Except some parts that seemed kind of  too much   But I can understand that if someone is desperate would surely use them  The book is so old but it s still modern  The art of war would never change  What may  and will  change is the equipment  guns and stuff  but the strategy seems the same  to me personally  And Sun Tzu knows about that  He knows a lot about that  He explains it so simply  as if he thought of it easily and there s nothing complicated about what you should do in every situation  And as you read the book you think that  Yes  That s what I would do  or  This is the best thing to do if    I don t know if I m explaining this the way I want but I think you get the general idea  It s a really good book  I can understand why it s a classic and I d reccomend it to anyone  It s like 100 pages long so it won t take too much of your time if you think you won t like it Anyways  that s about it   Read the book  xD  Besides tons of words I want to say  I admire him  I admire the intelligence of ancient Chinese people  What happened nowadays     revival of Zhou order as Confucius raised might be required soon       xD VERY relevant even today and most lessons translate very easy to life business  This is one of those books you have to read  amazing   Classic  It takes a creative mind to apply these strategies in the modern world but the age old conflict of differing human interests is as fresh as ever   A little dry but as per a good philosophical text which makes you really ponder its meaning   application this is a beautiful book  D It s been around for 2500 years or so for good reason Lectura obligada en las academias militares de todo el mundo    por una razon  aqui es donde se aprende que la mejor guerra es la que NO se tiene que pelear Its a great read  And a scary one All those rules can be successfully applied in all aspects of life  At war  at work  in everyday life And its scary because they work  Big time  A must read for all That s all I m gonna say  The phenomenal aspect of the text is how easily principles intended for application on the battlefield can seamlessly be applied to business  social relationships  etc  Some of the greatest quotes of all time can be found within this book s pages  Nothing much to say except that this book is probably more relevant and universal than any book that came after it   A definetly reading for everyone  Not only because is a small book if not because it deserve several readings to be fully understood  It s not how you think it would be  useful meaningful  Lessons from this book can be used as strategies for everyday life  too  A must read  Brilliant  From the commanders in the battle fields of Ancient China nearly 2 000 years ago to the current Officers of the armed forces around the world  almost all of them have read or been educated upon Sun Tzu s  The Art of War   This book writes down the  declared rules of war  that recently had just been generally known by the military itself  Although the book bases its writings off ancient Chinese wars and their history  one should not misunderstand its content  The book should in reality be called  A Step by Step Instructional Guide on How to Win Your Life   Whether it is a literal military battle or daily struggles that one faces in life  be it school or business  this book is a great guide on how to succeed  Sun Tzu presents the reader with almost every situation of a battlefield and provides them with multiple solutions  A few things that can be learned from this book is one must not always obey their leader  never put yourself into a tight situation  if everyone is not in it together then failure is sure to happen  knowing the knowledge of your terrain will lead you to victory  work with instead of fighting against your terrain  and most importantly  if one can reveal information about his enemy then with no hesitance do it  These are just a few of the many lessons that can be extracted from  The Art of War   With these entire life lessons one would think that this book will be a tough one to handle  however that is not the case  The beauty of Sun Tzu s book is that despite presenting its reader with almost every situation one can face in life  it does it in a manner that is easy to read and in a length that does not even trip the triple digit scale  99 pages  Less about war itself  than it is an assertive and magnanimous approach to leadership  Folly would be taking Art of War at face value  which is a millennially antiquated battle handbook  This is daily philosophy for interacting with people  using literal war as allegory  Considering the diminutive length  this should be read by anyone and everyone   This is the first book I ve read on military strategy and philosophy  What a compelling work  It was quickly apparent how the teaching ascribed to Sun Tzu have a timeless quality Sun Tzu advises that to overcome  one must know themselves and know their enemies  that warfare is both physical and psychological  that discipline and will are fundamental  Reflecting on his teachings on advancement and defense also help me to better understand some of our rugby set plays All in all  an excellent Chinese classic  Definitely something I would read and re read in the future  512 BC Tradition claims that the text was written in this year 206 BC   AD 220 The oldest copy of The Art of War has been dated to this time 1782 Translated into a European language for the first time by Frenchman Jean Joseph Marie Amiot  a Toulon born Jesuit missionary who had been living in Peking since 1751  Amiot worked at the court of the Qianlong emperor and devoted his life to fostering Franco Chinese relations  He was a chief correspondent with Louis XVI s government on Chinese matters  When Amiot learnt on October 8  1793 of the execution of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette by revolutionaries  he was so overwhelmed by the news that he died that very night  Amiot s translation was   to put it mildly   awful  and bore little resemblance to the actual text  It was  however  read with interest by some members of the French establishment  Outside of this  however  it was not a significant translation 1905 Translated into English for the first time by one Captain Everard Ferguson Calthrop  RFA  who was dwelling in Tokyo at the time  The translation was made with the assistance of  two Japanese gentlemen   The text was revised in 1908 and published in London  Both editions are awful  Calthrop skips difficult to translate passages and butchers everything to pieces  Calthrop also inserts commentary by anonymous Japanese scholars who  for all we know  may very well have just been the two translators who assisted him  The text is a corrupt  Chinese to Japanese to English mess of no historical value  Whether it had any impact on the book s popularity I really don t know 1910 The first scholarly English language version appears  written by one Dr  Lionel Giles  This would become the definitive edition of the text for over fifty years  In his introduction  Dr  Giles cites the awful 1905 edition of the Calthrop translation as one of his motivations for writing his own edition  It was written primarily for members of the academic community who held an interest in the Chinese language and in Chinese literature  This was the first edition to achieve any popularity 1944 The Giles translation is re edited and published in the United States for the first time as part of a series of military science books  no doubt to be read by members of the armed forces  Its republication by the American military itself can be seen as a testament to its growing popularity among anglophone readers 1963 The first  popular   as opposed to  scholarly   translation of the text  by Samuel B Griffith  is published  This translation was considered equal to the Giles translation and is still in print   source reddit  Must read for all strategy interested  Short  easy  and some very thoughtfull notes   Never can go wrong reading The Art of War  The Great book  My favourite  I read it every day and always learn something new  For me  the best one   Another timeless masterpiece     I don t know what to say but pure genius L arte della guerra e un testo semplice che racchiude una saggezza immensa A prima vista puo essere un trattato sulla guerra  invece e un libro che rivela come sia possibile vivere senza guerra  addirittura come sia possibile evitare lo scontro e vincere comunque le sfide della vita  La battaglia  lo scontro  sono l ultima risorsa Come qualsiasi saggezza  anche quella di Sun Tzu e espressa in modo semplice  la difficolta sta nel coglierla e saperla applicare Infatti bisogna accettare di non dover attaccare se non ci sono le condizioni giuste  adeguarsi allo stato delle cose e cogliere il momento giusto per agire  allenare il corpo e raccogliere conoscenze per quando quel momento arrivera ma anche saper porre le basi per creare momenti propizi sconvolgendo la strategia del nemico Cosa piu importante  bisogna agire non per distruggere il nemico  ma solo per vincerlo e se cio puo portare un vantaggio  La frase che meglio riassume il Sun Tzu e  conquistare intero e intatto il nemico  ma per comprendere il significato di questa frase e tutta la saggezza di questo stile di vita bisogna leggere il libro  Ve lo consiglio  I had no idea a translation of  The Art of War  could sound so homoerotically sexy  Good old fashioned advice for not just conducting  but avoiding war  I originally chose this book because after I watched the movie Wall Street 1987 version  Gordon Gekko  a wall street broker has many of his ways from The Art of War  I was interested in how a book that is thousands of years old can still have an impact in our modern businesses  This book taught me that conflict is an inevitable part of life  but everything that is necessary to deal with it is also present  The main idea within this book is that it is that it is better not to fight than to be involved in a conflict  but if you are going to have to fight  then you have to do it to win  and these are the various strategies  that will get you that result   The wise warrior evades the battle  Tzu 37   His book teaches you how to be a better leader and how to deal with people which are important in every aspect of life and war  If your enemy is secure at all points  be prepared for him  If he is in superior strength  evade him  If your opponent is temperamental  seek to irritate him  Pretend to be weak  that he may grow arrogant  If he is taking his ease  give him no rest  If his forces are united  separate them  If sovereign and subject are in accord  put division between them  Attack him where he is unprepared  appear where you are not expected  Tzu  68   The philosophy in this book can change a person because it makes you think what should you do and what you do can change how you act which can change the environment you are in  I understood how Gekko used the philosophy in this book to do business because the stock market are full of risks you take  The principles in this book can change how you act in a situation like that  The principles in this book can be used in every aspect of life which can change people  this is one book that I can read over and over again ktb shyq w mmt  llGy  mly blnSy H ldqyq  w brGm mn ql   dd SfHth l nh  kthr mn ry   w ystHq lqr  blf l       This book was extremely strange in that  in many regards  it could have been written right now  Even with the advent of technology in warfare  so much of this makes perfect sense  It s even completely applicable outside of war  This works well for business  for sports  heck  I can see this working for chess  What most remarkable  though  is that even though it s obvious Sun Tzu was a genious  he speaks simply  Some highly intelligent people can t communicate with other people at all  but this man knew how to get to the pith of his ideas and make them perfectly clear  which to me is a sign of real intelligence  This book can honestly change the way you live your life  The information in this book can be applied to a variety of topics  whether it be selling or sports  This is a great read  and i recommend it to anybody  This book has come in handy with my business dealings at my Nashville Web Design company  Sitening http   sitening com Amazing book for strategic thinking at all aspects  an amazing book  i loved it  this book is perfect for anyone who is interested in learning about military tactics or someone just wishing to gain some wisdom  Sun Tzu did an excellent job of writing this book and its lessons will always stay with me   Conflict is an inevitable part of life  once said Sun Tzu  this book will help to resolve those conflicts in the best possible way  this amazing book is a must read  This book not only applies to military tactics but can be extended to apply to real life situations where winning is vital  Sun Tzu outlines the strategies and thorough calculations that go into planning and becoming triumphant in war     14  Un libro de no ficcion  Mi internet me ha fallado en medio de la resena y eso me ha quitado toda paz y paciencia que habia ganado despues de leer este libro y hare la resena despues  Por ahora puedo decir que fue bastante interesante y muy facil de leer para lo antiguo que es  Esto si fue salirme de mi zona de confort y no me molesto en absoluto    Appear weak when you are strong and strong when you are weak  While I felt a lot of the quotes were repetitive  I ve looked back and enjoyed this book much more  I bring this book up in conversations more than I can count and I m thankful I ve read The Art of War  I use to be  still am  introverted and quiet  I put other people s needs before mine and always end up screwing myself over  After figuring out that people took advantage of my niceness and took me for granted  I realized it was time to change my attitude  The Art of War helped me with the adjustment  Not only did the Art of War talk about strategy in war  anyone can apply the rules in the Art of War in daily aspects and conflicts in their life  I can still be nice  but more firm and assertive  I can panic and be upset inside  but I ll stay calm and put together on the outside  Basically a  fake it til you make it  tactic  Short and sweet  I really like the emphasis placed on non violence by Sun Tzu  Of course it must be acknowledged that avoiding all conflict is not possible  But  so poignantly stated by Sun Tzu   to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence  supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy s resistance without fighting   A cogent point is also made about pride  Over and over Sun Tzu warns against fighting when it is not needed  Fighting just to prove a point is not  as he would say   supreme excellence   To the modern reader then  the true art addressed is not HOW to fight so much as a reminder of how careful we should be about WHEN to fight   It s old but oh so approiopriate This book is one of the most profound books written about dealing with conflict strategically  It is written by one of the premier scholars and translators of Taoist   Bhuddist literature  Although it is written from a militaristic view point  the language can be considered a general metaphor for strategically dealing with conflict with an opponent  I found it invaluable in learning to navigate dirty office politics for instance  A must read for the philosphically inclined  Bear in mind it was written in a very different era  during the Warring States Period   400 BC  On of the classics on how to conduct warfare  A must read for those interestedd in tactics  It has appeared on the Commandant of the Marine Corps reading list  Awesome book    It s a very interesting book that transportes the minds of those who reed it to other times  very different of our own  But the ideas  messages and moral are as applicable now as they were more than a thousand years  A must reed book for all that enjoy classic   imemorable tales of times long gone  pure art Gives you all the insights about how to go in case of conflicts that can even be applied in day to day life scenarios     EXCEPTIONAL Excellent bookGreat read  Should  if it isn t already  be required reading for all college students  The Art of War is a suggestive manual on combat by Sun Tzu that can easily be looked upon as a guide in the world today   The masterpiece can be applied as the Art of Life and Competition  Brilliant  Graphic format adds so much  A book that you simply have to read over and over just because you know it applies to your life  at whatever point you may be  So many little wars must be waged daily  Works on the battlefield and the office CLASSICS  When the enemy is relaxed  make them toil  When full  starve them  When settled  make them move   In conflict  straightforward actions generally lead to engagement  surprising actions generally lead to victory   Thus those skilled in war subdue the enemy s army without battle      They conquer by strategy   Know the enemy and know yourself  in a hundred battles you will never be in peril  When you are ignorant of the enemy  but know yourself  your chances of winning or losing are equal  If ignorant both of your enemy and yourself  you are certain in every battle to be in peril   In war  numbers alone confer no advantage   To     not prepare is the greatest of crimes  to be prepared beforehand for any contingency is the greatest of virtues   What is of the greatest importance in war is extraordinary speed  One cannot afford to neglect opportunity   I reread this book in regular periods  It is one of my most favorite book ever  The compilation of the simple rules  which could be adapted on every aspect of ones life  The conflict is the moving force of life  but it is necessary to go trough the complicated situation wisely and honorably gaining victory The pure text of The Art of War was translated several times and it is hard to tell which translation is the best  However I suggest for the first time reader to find the copy with commentaries   The authoritative book on strategy  Universal in application  It s a mandatory reading The knowledge is adaptable for management  leadership and war strategy  This book shows how although the tools in which we engage war have changed  that war itself has not   I confess  there are books which I really feel incompetent to rate  and this is one of them  Nonetheless  the five stars are for it being very interesting and absorbing read  and although about war  it seemed to me to be very human  That s what I liked the most  Unbelievable book  From its tactical views to military defences  I thoroughly enjoyed it  I have always been a fan of war games and I enjoy researching military campaigns as well as weapon advancement  The tactics in this book are unparalleled and I can connect a lot of them to wars that have taken place  I have been wanting to read this book for a while and I finally had the chance too  It did not disappoint  Tips like fighting the enemy where they aren t and making it seem like you are weak when your strong  really progressed my understanding of war tactics I recommend this book to people who enjoy reading about strategies  not just for war but for the knowledge  It can bore people very easily but the right person with the correct interests will never regret reading it   Sun Tzu knows how to win every battle you could imagine I love this book  I consider it required for anyone that considers themselves a warrior or a businessman  The lessons learned in this book translate to both arenas seamlessly  Amazing strategies by Sun Tzu    However  they seemed impossible for a human being      Always good for ideas  Very good for strategic minded individuals   One word  awesome   The relevance of this book to current day organizational and political structure and stragegy render this book a must read for any professional  This book is honestly one of the most interesting books I have read but also requires an interest in anything war related  If you re wondering why  it s because this book doesn t have a story to it at all  No  no  no  you see  this book is all about how you should go about war  Things that you should strive for  and things you should avoid  For example  he talks about how you should always be stealthy and have your enemy never predict your attacks  Also about how you shouldn t stay in a war too long because the economy will start falling apart  The best part of this ancient text is how accurate it still is today  The majority of the book is still taught today and commanders in the army all read this text to archive the knowledge that is inside  If you are the type of person that would be interested in war and how to go about battles  though you probably won t find this information useful  then definitely pick up this book and enjoy the heck out of it  If you aren t a fan of war then go back to your Judy B  Jones novels you used to always read back in elementary school and gloat about constantly  I honestly can t stand people who think they are special after reading a Judy B  Jones book even though any girl with a childhood read that book  It s almost as bad as that stupid Twilight fad that caused a war between Twilight fans and Twilight haters  The only thing worse than an overly obsessive Twilight fan is a person who tries to explain to you why Twilight is a bad movie and book  I bet that s a war not even Sun Tzu can tell you how to go about  Oh wow  I just realized how off topic I got  Oh jeez    Ummmmm      Wow I messed up my last book review     Shoot           Bye  must read  Talk about a book that will change the way one looks at difficult situations and tactical thinking  What makes this ancient book so interesting is its relevance even today s world because it extends past war tactics  It is actually applicable to the business world in ways that you never thought possible   Some words that have meaning everyday in our lives   This is true in life and in war  Although it took me a little while to get through I think it is a great book and can help you better understand how to deal with the world around you at certain times in your life   Une philosophie militaire incroyablement sage qui permet de mieux apprehender le conflit et meme de le dominer  L approche de Sun Tzu devrait etre lue de tous pour des raisons qui depassent le combat arme mais bien pour la facon dont il gere les rencontres et les relations  Comme plusieurs philosophes  il fait ressortir un facteur cle a la reussite   la connaissance de soi  Ancient Chinese wisdom for today s world Must for any strategist  be in government  army or any business  Two words  higher ground    As relevant today as ever  Traveling has been a habit for me over the past several years  and it makes it difficult for me to take around my books  possessions I value above all else   so they end up being stored somewhere or the other  or in some rare cases given away to people who expressed interest in reading them  The Art of War  however  is different  This is not a book to read once and keep on a shelve to act as a decorative piece  or collect dust  From this day  it will be one of the objects that I carry with me wherever I go  along with my keys  wallet  phone and laptop  A classic on strategy  atemporal in its wisdom and applicability in every aspect of life  I loved the book  It s great to see that people don t change through time  even though the culture does  Well this explains a lot about the Chinese unforeseen entrance and turn around of the Korean War  18 All warfare is based on deception  19 Hence  when able to attack  we must seem unable  when using our forces  we must seem inactive  when we are near  we must make enemy believe we are far away  when far away  we must make him believe we are near   In ART OF WAR  there is a rare thing in books in which all of it or most of it can relate to many things  If the reader uses some of these war tactics and strategies in the modern world  they may find it easy to relate  Business is war  but in a different scenario than actual battles  Thus it is easy to relate to this book  Even rivals in sports and entertainment can be outwitted by the wisdom in this book  It also adds examples of some actions  which show how these sayings and writings apply to the real world So no matter what you were looking for in this book  whether it be business  entertainment  sports  war games  actual wars  or even travel  you can be sure to learn more on how to attack life here The book s age is hard and easy to see at the same time  You can tell that it was written thousands of years ago by what Sun Tzu tells of   Chariots  gold pieces are currency  etc      but some of the grammar and language are shown well in the translation in the book  making it easy to read in English as well as other languages you would be able to find the book in The only weakness of this book would have to be its accented topic towards foreign countries  and much older devices  The way to break through this is for the reader to be able to translate it into his her life  This is an ultimate classic  The direction in this book goes well beyond the battlefield  entering into the ideas of social interactions and basic life structures  A man who deals with his business as Sun Tzu dealt with his war  would be a wise man indeed   So I actually read a different edition of this book  the Denma Translation from Shambhala Classics  That said  I think that the essential message of the book  and much of the actual text  is similar  if not identical  in both versions  I found this to be almost more of a meditative experience than a book in the conventional sense of the word  That is to say my usual tense  excited attitude when reading a novel was replaced by a sense of peacefulness and calm  One particular excerpt reads  As for the nature of trees and rocks  When still  they are at rest  When agitated  they move  When square  they stop   When round  they go Thus the shih of one skilled at setting people to battle is like rolling round rocks from a mountain one thousand jen high  It is exactly this unembellished writing style that allows the crucial underlying messages of the Art of War to pass smoothly from text to mind without the usual laborious process of trying consciously to retain and understand information  Through its metaphors  comparisons  and simple writing style  The Art of War relays a set of complex  immensely wise ideas from ancient China directly into the modern world  Loved it    Arguably the best book on strategy ever written  Not a cover to cover type but instead  a thumbing type  like taking random bites of peach mango pie at random intervals while writing something  aka living life   My personal copy smells really good and has great illustrations on it  3 Vivia eu  no inicio de 2015  um momento triplamente especial  acabara de completar 40 anos  estava de ferias com esposa e filhos viajando entre Rio  Minas  Bahia e Rio Grande do Norte e adotei como desafio ler um livro a cada quinzena  acompanhando a proposicao do criador do facebook naquela oportunidade  O livro escolhido para inicio desta longa jornada foi justamente A Arte da Guerra Pude identificarem varias passagens do livro comportamentos que ja possuia  outros que via nas pessoas com quem convivo alem de tantos outros que passaria a observar melhor Impressionante o quao atual sao os ensinamentos de Sun Tzu  Tao simples e antigos mas ao mesmo tempo tao atuais que parece terem sido escritos ontem por um desses escritores de livros de auto ajuda Fica nitido que os grandes valores de qualquer negocio  ou batalha  esta atrelado ao racional  ao fator humano  Valores como respeito  humildade  simplicidade e objetividade alem da pratica do planejamento genuino sao indispensaveis para o sucesso Sun Tzu valoriza o triunfo sem a destruicao do adversario  No nosso dia a dia  podemos comparar as relacoes ganha ganha  ao trabalho em equipe e ao reconhecimento dos resultados das equipes envolvidas nas tarefas desprezando se a monopolizacao das atencoes para o lider quando ha sucesso ou escolha por parte deste de um culpado no fracasso  I ve been meaning to read this book for quite some time  and I am glad I picked this version  Giles provides extensive notes into four  commentators  on Sun Tzu s writing  allowing for a more broad understanding of the translated texts  It took a minute to get used to the format  but otherwise I appreciated it for clarity and depth 6 50 from 2014 50 Book Challenge Une bible de strategie et de management   SUN TZU foi um grande general que viveu na China estimadamente 200 anos antes de Cristo  Sua obra famosa chama se  A Arte da Guerra   e foi traduzida e estudada detalhadamente em todo o mundo ocidental  Suas ideias foram e ainda sao amplamente aplicadas tanto na guerra como na paz  Sun Tzu  Sun Wu  foi tambem um filosofo antes de se tornar um general invencivel  e discute neste livro todos os aspectos da guerra  do tatico ao humano  numa linguagem ao mesmo tempo penetrante e poetica Esse pensador escreveu um tratado sobre a guerra que ate hoje serve como inspiracao a politicos  empresarios e ate treinadores de futebol  No livro  A arte da Guerra   o autor explica  em uma das mais significativas passagens  que para se vencer uma batalha  alem de se conhecer o adversario e fundamental a presenca do autoconhecimento no front  Sem a nocao exata de nossos defeitos e virtudes nao podemos almejar grandes conquistas  por mais que estejamos preparados Ao ler esse livro  muitas pessoas podem se perguntar  qual a inter relacao entre a  Arte da Guerra  e a Administracao  Contudo  como se vera a seguir  o livro de SUN TZU esta intimamente ligado as estrategias de negocios e a arte do gerencimento A relacao entre o livro ora analisado e a Administracao pode ser traduzida em apenas tres palavras   taticas  planos e estrategias   as quais  por sua vez  estao contidas em uma outra   planejamento   Na guerra  um exercito possui inimigos mortais aos quais precisa vencer  Para tanto  e preciso conhecer as intencoes desse mesmo inimigo  bem como seu potencial de ataque e defesa  Na Administracao nao e diferente  Uma organizacao tambem possui inimigos mortais  cuja concorrencia direta ameacam sua sobrevivencia  Para vence los  e preciso tambem conhecer seu potencial de ataque  capacidade de producao  rede de distribuicao  mercado  precos  publico alvo etc    alem de conhecer  ainda  suas defesas  produtos novos a serem lancados  promocoes de vendas  taticas de marketing etc   Em uma guerra  para que se possa vencer o inimigo e preciso  de um lado  conhecer ao maximo esse inimigo  e  de outro  preparar se ao maximo para o combate  Na Administracao da se a mesma situacao  Assim  deve se entender que  tal qual na guerra  quando uma organizacao investe em treinamento ou reciclagem de funcionarios  equivale ao esforco dos exercitos para fazer com que seus soldados sejam melhores que os soldados das fileiras inimigas  Da mesma forma  quando uma empresa encomenda uma pesquisa de mercado  isso nada mais e que a versao capitalista moderna da espionagem  Afinal  o que se quer e fazer o levantamento dos pontos fortes e fracos que o oponente possui  Portanto  como se ve  nao e por acaso que a frase mais famosa de  A Arte da Guerra  seja   conheca o inimigo e conheca a si mesmo  e voce pode lutar cem batalhas sem derrota   Dessa forma  ressalta se que  na era da globalizacao os ensinamentos de SUN TZU estao presentes nas estrategias empresariais e nas taticas de competicao entre as empresas  Hoje  em funcao da acirrada competicao pelo mercado  a empresa que nao inovar esta fadada a mediocridade ou ao fracasso  por esta razao e que empresas bem sucedidas constantemente introduzem inovacoes em seus produtos  Em suma  gerenciar uma empresa nao e muito diferente de comandar um exercito  posto que o mercado e tao somente uma forma aparentemente  pacifica  de batalha A obra de Sun Tzu aqui analisada e um rico livro de filosofia  nao devendo ser estudada apenas por militares ou adeptos de esportes combativos  Ao contrario  pode ser lida por todos indiscriminadamente  Trata se de uma licao de vida  um obra que visa ensinar o homem a postar com coragem e logica diante dos fatos mais variados  A linguagem facil  que nao remete o leitor constantemente ao dicionario  faz desse livro algo perfeito para estudantes de qualquer grau  mas principalmente para aqueles cujos estudos se voltam para as areas gerenciais  administradores  contadores  economistas etc    visto que os ensinamentos contidos nessas poucas paginas sao  em teor  maiores do que se pode encontrar na literatura convencional   A book on strategy written over two thousand years ago  Translated into many languages including English  it s methods are accessible to everyone  from world leaders  military strategists  business executives  to the average person looking for ways of better managing their daily lives  Although the book is about warfare  the strategies discussed can be filtered into your own way of life  It does not encourage war  but shows that if war is inevitable  then victory can be achieved through such methods as planning  tactics  offensive strategy and many other methods from direct assault on the enemy to their destruction from within  Some great phrases in the book include   the enemy s vulnerability is of his own making    we move when there is advantage to gain  we halt when there is none   and  when capable pretend to be incapable  when active  inactive  when near make the enemy believe you are far away   The Art of War remains one of the most intriguing books I have read  Not only is it a book on military strategy and topical for the current political climate  it is also an informative guide to managing and preserving your own way of life  It says war  By can very well mean life  Things translate at a very 1 1 obvious ease that shocks you  Landed my job and managed to fair reasonably well  modesty apart  in most interviews and vivas from tips I picked from here  No te deja picado  pero son cosas que hay que aprender para aplicarlas a la vida diaria  en los negocios politica y demas  very intriguing  common sense it seems  know thy enemy and know thyself  still a good read in my opinion  It is the ultimate how to book that offers the quintessenial guide to any conflict  Even though it was firet published almost 2000 years ago it stil applies to the modern period  It is no wonder it is still taught in West Point today  In one word  one that gets bandied about too often  timeless   Wow  This book not only about art of war  but about art of world Best practices about leadership and philosophy I will read this book again  I remembered this because of James Clavell s foreword  this really is a good read even after thousands of years the schemes still found in this book is still useful Essential Made certain my children had read it by age 20 Written in 500 B C  the  Art of War is not only a manual for practical military tactics but also a manual to which one can live their life by Here are Sun Tzu s 13 laws for being victorious in war1  Laying plans  The art of war is of vital importance to the state  It is a matter of life and death  a road to either safety or to ruin  Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected  2  Waging War When you engage in actual fighting  if victory is long in coming   the men s weapons will grow dull and their ardour will be damped  If you lay siege to a town  you will exhaust your strength  Again  if the campaign is protracted  the resource of the state will not be equal to the strain  3 Attack by Stratagem In the practical art of war  the best thing of all is to take the enemy s country whole and intact  to shatter and destroy it is not so profitable  4 Tactical Dispositions The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat and then waited the opportunity of defeating the enemy  5 Use of Energy The control of a large force is the same in principle as the control of a few men  It is merely a question of dividing up the numbers  6  Weak points and strong Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy  will be fresh for the fight  whoever is second in the field and has hasten to the battle  will arrive exhausted  7 Maneuvering an Army The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists of turning the devious into the direct and misfortune into gain  8 Variation of tactics There are roads which must not be followed  armies which must not be attacked  towns which must be besieged  positions which must not be contested  commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed  9 The Army on the March We now come to the question of encamping the army and observing signs of the enemy  Pass quickly over mountains and keep in the neighborhood of valleys  10  Classification of Terrain The natural formation of the country is the soldier  best ally  but a power of estimating the adversary  of controlling the forces of victory  and of shrewdly calculating difficulties  dangers and distances  constitutes the test of a great general  11 The nine situations  At first  exhibit the coyness of a maiden  until the enemy gives you an opening  afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running hare  and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you  12 Attack by fire There are five ways of attacking with fire  The first is to burn soldiers in their camp  the second is to burn stores  the third is to burn baggage trains  the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines  the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy  13 Use of Spies What enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer  and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men  is fore knowledge   Along with Atlas Shrugged  this is one of my favorite books of all time  Probably the most influential book in my adult life  I have read many editions and this  to me  is the most clear  concise  and multi dimensional version  A book for both war and peace with the underlying truth that the true battle is within  Z Great philosophy  You can learn from this book a lot  even when it s clear that you never will command armies on the field  Example  a great risk is not worth taking if the potential gain is small  Short  sweet and interesting  I am not used to reading books about war but it was intriguing to see the ideals behind the advancing army  The message is clear don t attack unless you have too but if you do  think   plan   attack  This  I suppose  can be used in many situations other then death  Easily read in an hour   Another fabulous translation by the gifted Cleary  Enjoyed this book many years ago  I want to re read it  I gave it away to someone who never returned it  I have lots of books given out  I hope the people I gave them to read them   Awesome book  all time favorite book War lessons for life  A guide to war and leadership  a book that will certainly follow me for the rest of my life    The Art of War  was written over 2 500 years ago by Sun Tzu  a Chinese philosopher and general  It is not so much a story as a manual on warfare  and it passes a great deal of information on to the reader  Sun Tzu explains the thirteen factors in winning wars  while transforming war from a test of power to an art  in a surprisingly gripping and fascinating way  He delves into strategies that I would never have considered  he mentions incredibly well thought out retaliatory tactics  From laying plans  to waging wars  to winning them  Sun Tzu is very wise in explaining the road to victory  Even as short a book as this is  it is likely one of the most inspiring works of literature that I have ever read  I can t quite think of a genre to categorize this under  but I would recommend this book to nearly anyone  Although written about combat  The Art of War applies to all aspects of life  When reading this I found many connections and applications to my everyday life  Everything Sun Tzu writes is about avoiding conflict although the avoidance of conflict applies to every situation  This work has influenced many military strategists throughout the ages although I feel everyone can benefit from reading this   One of the classics to re read from time to time and keep your mind sharp  Essential for so many people  but when writing fantasy it s so helpful  in my opinion   Cold and Elegant  As you grow older  more and more you ll realize and actualize this book It s hard to believe it  but this book is wonderful  I abhor war  violence  etc  but this book barely talks about it  In fact  it warns against going to war in the very first chapter  I found it remarkably flowing for a 2500 year old book translated from its original language  Plus  the second half with commentary has tremendous amounts of Chinese history in it  Reading this and a book on Chinese history shows that the two are intricately linked  I am 14 years old and in the 9th grade  I was looking for a book online and I saw this  I already had knowledge of what the book was but I just knew I had to read it  The book is 2 500 years old written by sun tsu a ancient General  I can say without a doubt this is the overall best book I have ever read it has a mixture of everything but more importantly it teaches you life lessons that you will use for the rest of time  Incredible analogies to the war of life and the battles we each fight in our daily basis  awesome if you understood it and saved it you will be a perfect strategiest The Best Book about motivation  self help and strategies on how to handle our lives obstacles  it motivates you not only to see your short term goal  but teaches you how to be patient and see the whole picture   long term  It may say  War  but war  as what is always constant in life  change   war has changed in various ways  from the Greek time  Feudal era or colonization of country to country where swords and power rule  to drastically change where in this era   War  is about how you get your way around school  work  peers and everyday challenges  This strategies can be implemented  for example  do  not chase a fleeing enemy   you may say  don t chase what s already gone   think about it     well  great book  I may even reiterate above and say   chase and read this book   This has amazing wisdom which can be applied in the workplace  sport  ect  not just in war   it is something that makes you think and makes you want to apply the rules to your own life  i appericate this and i need to implement more of this in my life  A must read for everyone in the military who happens to have common sense  If more military and political leadership would read this we would have more successful battles  unfortunately they do not  If you consider listening to the audiobook reading than I whipped through this in a few short days  The aside stories are where knowledge ties itself with philosophy  and really brings the story to a modern light  even if it s one of the oldest texts we re able to reference A great though exercise for anyone  Fascinating yet simple  This edition contains the original text with and without commentary for additional insight  However  this version also includes an absurd amount of editorial errors  Words to live by  A must read for anyone who wants to advance in the business world or gain an understanding of critical tactical thinking that is not limited to military conflicts  the knowledge applies to all areas of life  I read this to learn more about Chinese war strategies  I found the Sun Tzu part of this book interesting  The added commentary  which gave examples from history to illustrate these principles  was fascinating and invaluable for my research  Duzhe khorosha kniga  Chudovii pereklad i komentar  Vpershe ukrayins koiu  shche i do togo  Many people make the mistake of trying to use this work literally or even figuratively  it is neither  This should be used as an inspiration to inspire ideas and machinations which can be used in battle on various planes  This is not a book for relationships nor is it a book for societal kinships  it is about manipulation of reality preception  it is about the mastering of dominion  not to be used versus those close to you  Strongly recommended  one of the best strategic books I have ever read Piotr PietrzakAuthor of the prospects for humanitarian intervention in Syria I could see this being useful in a corporate deathmatch setting   Ralph D Sawyer translation  The Art of War starts with a very compelling first half of the book building up to Sun tzu translation I will say that the first half of the book was well written with a multitude of information  From historical background to the strengths and weaknesses of a general  The second half of the book was mind blowing for the amount of information it foretold  From the depths of when to attack  to the 9 terrains  This book has it all  You can even relate this book to your own life  Like me playing real time strategy games such as Total War  Attila Shogun 2  Overall this book was a joy to read and I would recommend it to anyone   also try reading  The I Ching    interpretation by Richard Wilhelm is great and  Tao Te Ching  by Lao Tze  One of the great treatises on the Taoist  Way   The Art of War by Sun Tzu perfects the practical philosophies of The Tao  hinted at so poetically by the more ancient Lao Tze  inspired as he was by the antediluvian I Ching  which some say is as old as 5 000 years As effective for the practical logistics of warfare  as it is to the day to day struggles of modern business  The Art of War can even be used in relation to every human relationship Focusing as it does on the idea of doing the appropriate thing  in the appropriate place  at the appropriate time  it can be a life changer for anyone willing to understand better the subtle and invisible connections in the world around us  and within  Excellent book  I have read it several times over the years and it is still one of my favorites  The principles can be applied to other areas of life besides just WAR  I have used it successfully to build some of the top sales teams in several industries  You just have to use a little of your imagination  A must read for everybody in a position of leadership or management  It really should be called the Art of Life  as it lessons translate better to everyday interactions that contemporary military engagements  Sun Tzu s  The Art of War  is an ancient book of military knowledge  It is filled from cover to cover with wisdom that can lead any army to victory  Several strategies are discussed  He tells about when to go to war  how to fight  and how to secure a win  Tzu describes the many elements and variables that go into maintaining and deploying an army  For example  traveling long distances and going without food can  empty  an army  making them vulnerable  Sun also says to avoid corruption at home while creating it in your enemies  ranks  I enjoyed learning about Sun Tzu s military prowess   I have enjoyed this book for many years  For the first time this weekend I read it in one day  I cannot say how important this book is to read and to use in daily life  I think every bookshelf is incomplete without it  Describing in detail military tactics and warfare strategy  this is a fun read  Even though it was written in the 6th century BC  you can apply the approach Sun Tzu uses for military combat to almost any conflict life can offer you  The only key is getting a good translation  or a copy with a lot of footnotes You can also learn how to storm an enemy stronghold without losing all your men  because hey  you never know  A must read  A must  this book is a classic and it teaches you a lot about strategy and intelligence  Wisdom on it can be applied to all aspects of your life  Very good one  Preparation for reality  I pride myself on peace and calmness    and prepare myself for wars that may be ahead  This book does just that   Timeless strategy  Useful in any profession or field  I first came across this as a reference in another book  I wot not which  I pursued it  found a copy and read avidly  The most incredible thing about the book is its historical aspect  written two thousand five hundred years ago at a time when we Celts thought wattle and daub was pretty smart and warfare was at its most bestial and basic  Small wonder it has become compulsory reading for the officer class  It has applications  however  throughout live in all fields  I have used its axioms repeatedly in medicine and I know that it has been reqorked as a management tool  It should be read by anybody who has an open mind and especially by anybody who professes an interest in China   2500 years and as useful as ever   Not the kind of book you just read once  This book stands out not only as instruction for military  which I must say I have no idea about  but it can be used as a way to approach any conflict and works on many levels  This is the kind of book you keep out on a table somewhere and flip to random pages whenever you get the chance  Great book for philosophy   ktb yTbq f  kl mjlt lHyh  I need to read the Art of War over and over and apply almost everything I learn  I d like to get to a point where I have it memorized  so that it is more readily available in my mind  How can one man be so perceptive of humankind across the ages  while I am unable to   Amazing  still totally relevent A True classic  This book is not simply for folks interested in war or military strategics  The information in this text has immense knowledge and helpful teachings on interpersonal relationships  It is very easy to read  as well  good old classic common sense strategy  Still valuable thousands of years later   A manual for survival  I published  The Art of War as an Audio Book http   www audible com pd Classics Th    everone should read or be killed on the battlefield of life  The wise warrior avoids the battle   a must read for all  The Art of War  is an ancient Chinese military doctrine widely believed to have been written by one of history s greatest military figures  Sun Tzu  who was a high ranking general  strategist  and tactician in the 5th century BCE  Though a relatively short book   The Art of War  consists of 13 chapters each covering one aspect of warfare  from the management of a state during periods of conflict  to understanding your enemy on the battlefield by respecting their advantages and exploiting their weaknesses  Despite it s background   The Art of War  is not a celebration of the honor and glory of making battle  but an insightful warning of recklessness and abuse of power  As well  peace should always be the objective before any conflict  therefore the road to war as a last resort  If war must come  victory should be obtained quickly and not prolonged to cause further suffering abroad and at home  Historians and generals today believe that if Western civilization had embraced such counsel  many of Europe and America s bloodiest wars could have been avoided with fewer setbacks  Ironically   The Art of War  is not only referred to by present military powers  but is also a practical guide for athletes  lawyers  and businessmen  Now  why exactly would a treatise on ancient Chinese warfare pertain to any of today s modern vocations  Simply put  many competitive industries value it s insightful philosophy concerning the essence of preparation  the calculation of risks in decision making  and the many roles of leadership in obtaining one s objectives  Sun Tzu as a teacher instructs how to counter adversity through the employment of psychology  discipline  and awareness of your advantages and disadvantages   He who knows when he can fight and when he cannot will be victorious     The Art of War  is an incredible book for anyone seeking self improvement and empowerment  while understanding how to confront life s predicaments through the perspectives of a rational commander  http   lola kiss blog cz 1509 sun cLze li nepritele snadno vydrazdit drazdi ho  Predstirej slabost aby si vedl

world  I greatly enjoyed this book and recommend it too everyone   also I ve found Machiavelli s Prince is a great read afterwards  It is interesting and challenging to take the principles of war strategy in this book and apply them to other facets of life such as faith and business  Helpful in becoming better than I am today The art of war is an extremely subtle book that somehow expresses truly deep and complex concepts using a simple straight forward writing style  I find it is more of a general guide on how to live than a military handbook  All it requires is for the reader to use his imagination and find parallels in its day to day life  Thomas Cleary s version is in my opinion one of the best translations out there  Especially due to its incredible  translaters introduction  which masterfully introduces the reader into the prevailing taoist mentality under which the book was written  If you already read the Art of War and found it somewhat simple or weird or just plain unintelligible  read Thomas Cleary s introduction No doubt this is a great book   but in its original  raw form  it is of little value to us  It is like ore of gold which ought to be processed to get gold  I brood about its relevance to our times  times of peace  How do we interpret it to make it relevant for our day to day lives   Well  the great nation of the Chinese  since old ages contributed with great knowledge to the universal development of the world in science  art  philosophy  culture and much much more Sun Tzu s Art of War is not a military tactician s 101 lesson book It teaches us how to approach conflicts  how to battle social circles  how to approach your foe and friend A famous quote within the book is generally known as   All warfare is based on deception  Most cunning plans have been born from the idea of illusion and deception  mostly in social encounters between most people of a certain intellect and equally civilized Either way  the book simply speaks for itself  every man must read it  in order to build his character  respect for one s opponent and the tactics to overcome one s issues in all fields possible  Un classico  Mi dispiace che questi insegnamenti siano stati applicati a quella cosa chiamata Marketing    molto peggio della guerra    Constant factors needed in the deliberation of strategic approach  A classic must read for anyone in today s society  Timeless principles that can be applied to any walk of life   The Art of War is about so much more than just war  If its taken literally it is clear how it helped in ancient warfare  if its taken metaphorically  there are several important themes developed by Sun Tzu and they can be applied to portfolio   risk management  business  personal life  politics or any other place challenges exist It discusses any sort of struggle  confrontation or strategic planning  very interesting read  sh t Sl mhm t jyy khh mytwny Tl t bh dst byrtym khwdt rw bh khwby szmndhy khnw Hl yh nqshh Hsb shdh

Year s resolution to read work from  at least  one classic author every month  When I made the resolution  I had authors such as Dickens  Faulkner  O Henry  and Hemingway in mind  I thought about it though  and decided the term  classic author  didn t necessarily need to mean  western author   so I bought the book    Read more at http   jameskiester blogspot com 2011 04 sun tzus art of war html  Sempre quis ter este livro na minha Biblioteca e e sem duvida indispensavel na mesma  O motivo e simples e obvio  permite de uma forma fria e pragmatica analisar um problema ou uma situacao e agir da forma mais eficaz  Nao e necessario aspirar a ser um grande lider militar ou empresarial para entender e aplicar as ideias apresentadas  Este e um livro puramente pessoal e que cabe a cada um tirar o seu proprio partido do mesmo  A cultura asiatica tem fama por dar valor ao introvertido  ao sabio e a eficacia  e ao ler  vera isto reflectido  Dou tambem os meus agradecimentos ao tradutor Lionel Giles e as suas notas  que foram igualmente indispensaveis para entender melhor os pontos apresentados em todos os capitulos  Se gostar de um auxilio para tomada de decisoes e manter uma mente equilibrada  Recomendo NOTA  Como nao encontrei a versao de Lionel Giles no Goodreads  deixo mencao e opiniao nesta pagina O que interessa e que a mensagem passe  Yeah  The Art of War that fits in your pocket for quick reference  Another good Art of War  http   suntzusaid com  A classic to understand business and diplomatic strategy  A  must have  to anyone who aims to pursue a career in any of these areas   reading for the 3rd time now A must read   Every serious tactician should carry around this excellent translation of Sun Tzu s classic  The Art of War   It s so small it ll fit right in your back pocket  Having read this  my ninja training is now complete and my plans for World Domination are now in action  You have been warned  I needed some help with an upcoming presentation and I decided to read The Art of War by Sun Tzu  It must have been one of my best choices  First of all  this book is brilliant  Yes  there are parts that are about the actual facts  food  money  ground of war and yes  those details won t help anyone who is just searching for some strategic help  but you have to remember that this book was written in 500 B C  and it was about actual war  Otherwise  there are so many parts of this book that will help anyone who is in need of great advise to win over at any  battlefield  Here are some of my favorite quotes  The way of war is a way of deception   I have heard that in war haste can be folly but have never seen delay that was wise   Ultimate excellence lies not in winning every battle but in defeating the enemy without ever fighting  The highest form of warfare is to attack strategy itself   Be ready for the unexpected   Know the enemy  know yourself  and victory is never in doubt  not in a hundred battles   Weakness stems from preparing against attack  Strength stems from obliging the enemy to prepare against an attack   Words of peace  but no treaty  are a sign of plot   Never move except for gain  Never deploy except for victory  Never fight except in a crisis   A thought provoking and ever springing well of wisdom  An extremely quotable book with many teachings which may be applied to the many aspects of life  Much of the book contained fairly intuitive information  but it had nuggets that made you reflect on how that certain piece would be applicable in today s society  It is a very short read  but most everyone should spend that little bit of time reading this collection of Sun Tzu s knowledge  As with The Prince  great advice on every page  An incredible book  this book really explains what type of world that Sun Tzu lived in  My favorite translation of the Art of War  The translation is as spare as the original epigrams  It also contains translations of the core commentaries as well as various modern commentaries  this might sound stupid  as to why I love this book  but I do not particularly care  I know for a fact that my opinion is better than yours  I never  not one  won a game of chess before reading it  I m still not good at it  but what I read helped me actually won a game  This book is misunderstood by some  as only being applicative to war s and countries  but it has many other words of advice that offer practicality in the daily lives of people  especially those who own operate a business or are even citizens of a capitalist society  All of the segments can be used as metaphors for running  not only others more efficiently  but also yourself  The title is quite deceiving as well  as Sun Tzu takes the stance that war should be the last resort of diplomacy  lktb ry   lkn lktb

 If you know yourself but not the enemy  for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat  If you know neither the enemy nor yourself  you will succumb in every battle   This quote in particular struck me as sound advice for not only battle  but daily life as well  Despite a thousand or so years passing  most of the tips Sun Tzu gives are still solid battle strategy  That s what makes  The Art of War  so good  It s still relevant today  This was not the translation I actually read  but I could not find the one I did    from Shambala Press  I have read this book probably 13 or 14 times    by far the most times I have ever revisited a book    with the exception of perhaps Calvin and Hobbes comic strips  At one time  I was making a point to read it once a month  Basically  it is ancient Chinese strategy for how to conduct warfare    but the true message of the book  I believe  is in seeking a way to peace  There are volumes of wisdom here    and in many ways it is perhaps my all time favorite book  While it is largely a manual written for generals of armies long ago  its lessons have parallels in all facets of our day to day life  to our interactions with others  to business  to negotiations  to politics  to poker  especially    Just writing this all down makes me want to read it again  I will never be without this book close at hand   Sodankaynnin taito on kirjoitettu Kiinassa noin 2500 vuotta sitten  se on siis Raamattuakin vanhempi teksti  Kun teos on kestanyt nain kauan ajan hammasta ja sita luetaan vielakin ahkerasti  kyseessa taytyy olla poikkeuksellisen hyva kirja  Niin se onkin  En osaa edes kuvitella  millaista elama oli 2500 vuotta sitten  mutta teoksen kokonaisvaltainen ajattelu sodankaynnista  strategisesta ajattelusta ja ihmisten johtamisesta jaksaa hammastyttaa ajankohtaisuudellaan  Sun Tzun teksti on yksinkertaista  selkeaa ja samalla filosofisen syvallista  Kenraaleille johtajina asetetaan kovat vaatimukset  Heilta edellytetaan mm  viisautta  tyyneytta  puolueettomuutta ja itsehillintaa  Heidan tulee kohdella alaisiaan hyvin  kuin omia lapsiaan  Sun Tzun mukaan ihmisten kayttamisessa on oikea menetelma kayttaa seka ahneita etta typeria  viisaita ja rohkeita  ja antaa kullekin vastuu tilanteessa  joka sopii hanelle  Ihmisilta ei saa vaatia sellaista  mihin he eivat kykene Kirjan kokonaisvaltaista ajattelua kuvaa  etta sotataidon huippuna on vihollisen kukistaminen ilman taistelua  Ensisijaisen tarkeaa sodassa on hyokata vihollisen strategiaa vastaan  Huonoin toimintalinja on hyokata kaupunkeja vastaan  Sodankaynnin taidossa korostetaan toimintojen nopeutta ja oikea aikaisuutta  vihollisen harhaanjohtamista ja yllattamista Sun Tzun mestarilliseen ajatteluun kannattaa tutustua siita riippumata  kiinnostaako sodankaynti vai ei  Everyone has an absolute favorite book that he she revisits once in a while  This book is mine  I try to read a different edition every year  When I run out of editions  which would be never  I will probably go back and reread the older ones  This book transcends time and cultural context  The supreme act of war is in subduing the enemy without fighting  A line by Sun Tsu which is pertinent to this day  A book written originally describing stratagems and tactics to win wars avoid defeats and can prove extremely beneficial if applied in daily life as well  Highly recommended   When you are small in number  you must appear to be many  When you are near  you must appear to be far  When you are ready  you must appear to be unready  Good advice for every situation  Absolutely fantastic  along with Machiavelli s the Prince  is a great book to study psychological manipulation and deception The Art of War is an extremely quick read  and it is well worth your time  The book itself offers many ideas on how you can achieve success through basic principles in just about anything you are attempting to do  While the text itself is written about war  the ideas are easily translatable to the modern world in business  school  and many more areas of society I think the most interesting aspect of this book is the fact that it has with stood the test of time  and it still holds a place of significant relevance in today s world  You  as the reader  will be able to obtain a great knowledge of Sun Tzu s principles in an easy to read  list style format This is a book that I would recommend to anyone  I would especially recommend this book to any individual who is in the process of embarking on a new journey in their life such as attending a different school  beginning a new job  or entering any other kind of network in today s world  I personally found this book to be a great resource and aid in completing classes in both highschool and currently in college  fascinating book  GREAT BOOK             I love this classic because of the universal truths explained in a simple way Read it once  twice  thrice    and you will always find something new and enlightening  A book that you should always have a copy with you   It s a classic for a reason  This should be an annual read for anyone who loves strategy and wants to improve their ability to see a situation from multiple angles and make high quality decisions  I actually listened to the new recording made by the infamous GOT Littlefinger  Aidan Gillen  Pure wow  Precise  succinct  crafty   I enjoyed reading the art of war by Sun Tzu  translated by Thomas Cleary The book has a very detailed introduction explaining part of his job  history about the book and the biography of Sun Tzu and the other four characters that explain with their points of view some of Sun Tzu statements This is for most people a treasured book due to the time when it was written and the knowledge it carries  cuanta sabiduria    This book is a perfect guadance on how to act successfully in any conflict situation  The ancient wisdom of great Chinese commander Sun Tzu reveals all secrets of ultimate success not only on the battle field  but can also be successfully applied in business  Great book  This is like the holy bible  you just read it over and over i keep a copy  in my bag knowledge never gets old   Timeless in its information  And Limitless in its application  This book has been applied to subjects ranging from business to personal relationships even cooking and performing magic  this is the source of all strategic thought   This is one of those books that everyone should read at least once  It s clever and interesting and will be very  very useful if the country is ever overrun by bandits   The essential warfare tactics from ancient China still hold true today  Arte da Guerra e um classico  todo praticante de artes marciais o le  e embora seja adotado como treinamento em administracao de empresas  o que eu mais gosto nele e sua conotacao basicamente militar  This is one of two editions of Sun Tze s classic that I own  the other is a bilingual edition published by a Hong Kong publishing house which I vastly prefer over the BN edition  Neither translation  however  is adequate  For example  in the first verse  both translators translate  guo  as  state   when it should be more properly translated as  country   No one says   I will die for my state   but people do say   I will die for my country   wei guo er si   Or again  in the famous or infamous 6th verse or chapter  Sun Tze employs a phrase which the two translations render as  deception is the basis or basic quality of war  But Sun Tze employs a three word phrase  the middle character of which is  dao   or  tao   as in  Taoism    so that a more literate translation that gives a better feel for the original would have to say that deception is the  way  of war  where  way    dao   is allowed to carry with it the moral and indeed cosmic resonances it would have for a Chinese reader  Sun Tze s use of  dao  anticipates  some 2000 years before the fact  Machiavelli s use of  virtu   Hence I prefer an edition with the original Chinese  The Barnes and Noble edition suffers the further defect that Sun Tze s original divisions into 100 verses chapter have been butchered and disregarded  In short  a classic and immortal text  a shoddy edition  I should have read this book 30 years ago  Amazing   have read it 3 times this year  Un muy buen libro sobre las estrategias del triunfo This book is always on my bookshelf  I refer to it constantly tis gud buk  i read lots of translashus but i tink Thomas Cleary is 1 of teh best translaters and i liek his translations bestest of all  it may tak a while 4 u to understand it sum peeple may need 2 or 3 time reading it but it rally gud when u understand   Deceptively simple  Can be read in under an hour but what would you honestly get out of that  I think the better idea would be to read it three or four times a year for like  the rest of your life  That would allow it to really sink in  And hell  if you don t like it  Unless you read glacially slow  you ve likely only wasted about 47 minutes of your life   If you are looking for a leadership book  this is the book for you  Put all leadership books aside and read this one  only this  The book contains philosphical techniques and military tactics that we can use in our everyday lives or when we re facing something challenging at school or work  It gets right to the point without boring the reader with long introductions  I disagreed with some points but agreed with more  I myself couldn t stop underlining every sentence  It should definetly be on everyone s to read list  This is one of the great classics of military thinking  It is one of many books I read during the time that I served as an officer in the U S  Army  Indeed  I have read and own many different translations  The translation by Samuel B  Griffith was required reading for all officers when I was assigned to the First Cavalry Division At first  western readers may have some difficulty understanding Sun Tzu because of his use of abstract metaphors  For example  he says   the potential of troops skilfully commanded in battle may be compared to that of round boulders which roll down from mountain heights   His point is that the effort required to start such a boulder rolling down the mountain pales in comparison to the force it has when it gets to the bottom of the mountain  Thus  this roughly corresponds to at least two of the principles of war espoused by U S  Army doctrine    the principles of mass and economy of force For those who want more depth  another very useful translation is the Gary Gagliardi translation  http   www goodreads com book show 23      In his introduction  Gagliardi explains that the  formulaic nature of the original Chinese does not translate well into English   For that reason  Gagliardi has the original Chinese words and a word for word translation on the left page and a modern English translation on the right page Another version I have read is the translation by Ralph Sawyer  http   www goodreads com book show 31      whose extensive commentary is very helpful  l ymr  ly st   shhr dwn qr  hdh lktb nh ldstwr ldh  yjb  n yHfZh kl mn y ml f  lsys  lsys  mtdd llHrb wlHrb mtdd llsys

 not just  war    there is a reason that business leaders and generals alike read and quote this book   Fantastic book that everone in business should read and the binding is so good that it feels as good as it reads I listened to this as an audio book  but it is one that I would like to read and re read in the future  Nearly every sentence is packed with knowledge about tactics  many of which are applicable not only to warfare  but also to life  Loved it   ktb mmtz   df ny lfDwl l qr hdh lktb b d qtbs lshykh mHmd bn rshd fy ktbh   wmDt mn fkr   qwl mn ktb   fn lHrb   wflsfh smwh b n   lsbq

going to war    If it is in winter it will be too cold   if it is in summer it will be too hot  So it should be neither in winter nor in summer  If it is in spring it will take people away from sowing and planting  if it is in autumn it will take people away from reaping and harvesting  Should they be taken away in either of these seasons  innumerable people would die of hunger and cold  And  when the army sets out  the bamboo arrows  the feather flags  the house tents  the armour  the shields  the sword hilts    innumerable quantities of these will break and rot and never come back  The spears  the lances  the swords  the poniards  the chariots  the carts    innumerable quantities of these will break and rot and never come back  Then innumerable horses and oxen will start out fat and come back lean or will not return at all  And innumerable people will die because their food will be cut off and cannot be supplied on account of the great distances of the roads  And innumerable people will be sick and die of the constant danger and the irregularity of eating and drinking and the extremes of hunger and over eating  Then  the army will be lost in large numbers or entirely  in either case the number will be innumerable  And this means the spirits will lose their worshippers  and the number of these will also be innumerable  I wish I could read this book in original This book takes a special place in my library   and my heart    I adored this  I thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful simplicity  Whilst I understand that this was not written for entertainment  but rather instruction  it is something which I feel is approachable for everyone  So many of the techniques can be applied to the every day battles we face in our lives  I would recommend this to everyone  I really feel it has a universal appeal  Obviously a classic  I love his succinct sentences  Sadly it took me a while to get through it  likely due to its fact based content style  There is nothing much to say here  It is a timeless classic  What I liked about this edition was that it not only featured the core text of the Art of War  but that it also included a lot of commentaries and historical examples  I d definitely recommand this book for anyone who is interested in learning about strategy and tactics  military or both   Brilliant  Applies to every aspect of daily living  from raising children to negotiating with your wife or your boss   A great way to gain mental toughness where it is required  A strong mind really is more useful than a strong left hook  Definetely a book to keep for a lifetime it will be relevant to a lot of situations because  war  is an inevitable part of life  Loved it If you are working in the area of Business strategy  you should never miss  it is not an easy book to read  but worth the struggle  Comprehensible  Always applicable Must read  This is a short book with a profound philosophical message about the importance of knowing your enemy  knowing yourself  and stopping your enemy from knowing either of these things  Some of the specific tactics it recommends are  of course  dated  but the principles still apply  and who doesn t want to say they ve read such a renowned classic anyways  It is a very quick read  Not written as a book  but more like scripture or proverbs  I d love to keep a copy at my desk for reference  While the writing is specifically geared towards war  many of the sayings can be applied as advice and motivation in other areas of life  Connais toi toi meme  connais ton ennemi  ta victoire ne sera jamais mise en danger  Connais le terrain  connais ton temps  ta victoire sera alors totale  This book is a must read for any person looking to survive in this crazy world Fascinating Read     All written holds true to this very day and applies to even every day scenarios in one s life  I have read it NUMEROUS times  What can I say    must read book if you want to be a successful competitor in anything  Favorite Book in the world  Gonna read it again  In some circles this book  The Art of War  is required reading  The original text was written about 500 B C  by Sun Tzu who is the oldest military treatise in the world  The original text was written in Chinese  What I have has been meticulously translated into English and compressed to hold the principles  The student is able to adapt these principles to modern warfare and even now twenty five centuries after its preparation one can adapt the fundamentals  which influence the way we can win by the decisions we make in a variety of situations and circumstances  It is indeed a valuable guide for all who want to win and succeed in life whatever the chosen career the terms and tactics learned in this philosophical text can be used in any faculty  it s truly and interesting eye opener to aggressive tactics  For anyone getting into the business world which has intense competition  or for sportsmen and athletes or politicians  this is a book which you just can t ignore  Absolutely absolutely brilliant original   authentic pure way of thinking This text should be required reading in high school  It is certainly a short reference  but that it is short only makes it more important  While some of the situations do not apply to everyday life  there are more than a few lessons to be learned for even the simplest of situations Or if you re going to start a war somewhere  You just never know  It is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself  you can win a hundred battles without a single lossIf you only know yourself  but not your opponent  you may win or may loseIf you know neither yourself nor your enemy  you will always endanger yourselfAll warfare is based on deceptionHence  when we are able to attack  we must seem unableWhen using our forces  we must appear inactiveWhen we are near  we must make the enemy believe we are far awayWhen far away  we must make him believe we are nearMeaning fast as the wind  silent as a forest  ferocious as fire and immovable as a mountainIf your enemy is secure at all points  be prepared for himIf he is in superior strength  evade himPretend inferiority and encourage his arroganceIf your opponent is of choleric temperament  seek to irritate himWhat is essential in war is victory  not prolonged operationsWar is necessary evil must be avoided when possible Simply put  Sun Tzu says that it is better not to fight than to be involved in a conflict  but if you are going to have to fight  then you have to do it to win  and these are the various strategies  often brutal  that will get you that result Niccolo Machiavelli  in The Prince says if you are in a position of power and seek to maintain it  it is better to be loved and respected  but if you can t achieve that  then at least enforce respect and these are the  often brutal  strategies that will get that result I say  if you are going to be a politician in the generally winning party and you don t like reading much  The Prince is for you  Very sly  If however you see yourself in opposition  arguing your point  try Sun Tzu first For the rest of us the books are short and make interesting historical and somewhat philosophical reading but they aren t going to change your life other than giving you a leg up on the intellectual book ladder  always a plus for the pseuds   view spoiler  Who  me  Yah think     hide spoiler   The best strategy book to apply to business  quests  dreams and even your personal life  Love it  Read it a few times for new interpretations  nuggets of wisdom each time  This book is so damn good this is all I can say about it and it also worth buying a hard copy   333 Read for the 7th time Sun Tzu s Art of War is one of those world s finest classic literatures that marks and influences those who will challenge themselves to read this military treatise  It discusses tactics and strategies in military affairs  that are implicitly related and indirectly applied to the fields of business affairs  human psychology  management  ancient history  military sciences  politics  anatomy of organizations in conflicts  and the likes  Classics remain classics not because they were written in the ancient times  they were called classics because they continue to have meanings   different meanings when read in different circumstances and moods  They become more useful as we use them  therefore we grow wiser with them  Understanding Sun Tzu s treatise is understanding ancient methods of resolving conflicts  handling battles  and hailing to the great spiritual tradition of Taoism  This is a classic  Period  This is my second reading of this masterpiece and as such  it is a book to be studied  Although it Makes Reference to war  it is a book about learning to deal with conflict in general by avoiding it  That is correct  because conflict has consequences that are costly at many levels  At the same time its message is also to prepare to win  It is a great book for people in business as it can help deal in a world that is highly competitive but its applications are universal  For this summer I can recommend THE ART OF WAR by SUN TZU THE OLDEST MILITARY TREATISE IN THE WORLD  I ve read this book during one of my worst period of my life   my separation  I was facing to this struggle   harrowing and distressing phase of my life   feeling of bad emotions   depressing and likewise be under attack  Yes under attack   as well as in the war   feeling to be heated and being beaten   threatened  Well   i thought   that s life and that  s my life at moment  I started to read the ART OF WAR   1 page every day for elaborate an exit strategy   be capable to win my ex wife Sentences in the book as   The quality of decision is like the well timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline  simulated fear postulates courage  simulated weakness postulates strength  The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy s not coming  but on our own readiness to receive him  not on the chance of his not attacking  but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable  Therefore those sentences thought me a diffferent approach and point of view facing the divorce and consequently the life after divorce  WHAT ABOUT MY DAYS NOW   I HAVE A SELF PERCEPTION WAISER  MORE OBSERVER AND STRATEGIC   and ACTUALLY I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THE ART OF WAR AS STRATEGY MANUAL OF EVERYDAY LIFE  BATTLEwww theitalianbookclub com shy mn lHy       A read and reread  The Art of War reminds me of Machiavelli s Prince with regard to its focus on strategic thinking and planning  The brevity with which Sun Tzu discusses war and strategy makes it all the more engrossing  A more modern comparison could be the 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene  Classic  Brief and interesting ancient Chinese warfare guide by Sun Tzu  Some of the best life lessons ever  on and off the battlefield  The enigmatic ancient Chinese general and intellectual Sun Tzu  whose work may have actually been the work of several different contributors catalogues in The Art of War a comprehensive discussion about the nature of human conflict and the wisest strategies that lend themselves to victory  the most noble of victories being the one achieved without battle  Apart from On War by Carl von Clausewitz it is wholly without peers as an insightful and interesting study into military science as applicable today as it has been on every pleasant dale transmogrified into a bloody splatter on the annals of history  from Alesia to Austerlitz   E il piu potente manuale adatto in passato ai generali di guerra  e al giorno d oggi ai grandi economisti  capitalisti e imprenditori  I enjoyed this a lot  There is so much knowledge and wisdom in this  that I am compelled to read it again and study it more thoroughly The first time through was like speed reading  I just could not get enough  quick enough I am sure I will read this a third time to help put it all into practice  one of the most smallest book i have read  yet the most powerful Adept and in Tianxia  all under heaven    Wow  Great bookThis book teaches you not about war but you can use it in just about every situation  Great book   To put it simply  cleverly elegant  Or elegantly clever  This is filled with densely packed wisdom  poetry in the service of non fiction  It is more of a guide to competition rather than a how to  useful as a solid foundation to build off of   1  One of the early seeds of philosophy 2  Simply written but so  brain working  3  The concept is great 4  Beyond war 5  Applicable philosophy in any field of life 6  One of the greatest book that I ever read  Just read the book and you ll know why I gave it five stars     P Mostly everything of it  I liked  The only thing I didn t like was the pdf version of the Art of War that I downloaded was crappy  but this doesn t have anything to do with the content of the book anyway  so I still gave it five stars   Dunya nin en onemli ve en temel eserlerinden biri yaklasik 2600 yil once Cinli dusunur ve komutan Sun

like him  An emperor send him a group of females to see wat he can do  sun Tzu separate them into two different group an pick two specific leaders but the first time he choose the females were only fooling and giggling around so he slash their heads off in front of the other so they can see that he s really serious about them being a great warrior like himself   Sun Tzu choose secondly but this time the females see that he meant every word that already being said from his mouth so they all listen to him an do what ever he told them to do  This is not really a story it a book of strategy an tactics that he have done an said In the book the way his strategies are setup if you follow them no way you can loose a war unless u didn t follow them right  Some of the laws he mention in the book are  To know your enemy  you must become your enemy  To a surrounded enemy  you must leave a way out  Keep your friends close  and your enemies closer  You have to beleave in yourself  Avoid what is strong and strike at what is weak  Attack him where he is unprepared  appear where you are not expected   These are strategy that being use most by sun Tzu throughout the book  http   www goodreads com assets close     I found this to be an impressive read  While it may seem that re material presented is common sense  application of the lessons is less prevalent  Consider this a primer from where additional tactical and strategic thought can flow   Ingenious strategy  Nothing else compares  Despite the repetitive use of the phrase  Sun Tzu says      it is very readable  However  do not expect to read this book straight through  I found myself reading a page  and then stopping to analyse the concepts in terms of past and present wars  The Art of War is highly recommended for writers of historical fiction as well as for writers who employ any form of warfare in their plots  All fun and games aside  I think this should be required reading for all military officers as well as politicians who command military forces   lHkm Dlh lmw mn  hdh lktb mly  blHkm   fy lmjl l skry  mmkn wSf lktb dh b nh shrH m ny   lHrb khd h   bshkl  mly  One of the most important books ever written  If you want to understand people and better understand yourself read this book  I have read it 13 times and continue to learn from it  What it says about war is important  What it says about how people think and how to read situations is far more imporant  A lot has changed since the book was written  Today  war includes ballistic missiles  nuclear warheads  satellite communications and what not  but the underlying tactics of war are still the same  Sun Tzu has beautifully broken the various constituents of a war into 13 chapters  Every chapter tells us how the factor in discussion plays an important role in the artwork i e  war  Sun Tzu stresses on the fact that victory is all about being at the right place at the right time  But to know when and where the victory can be achieved  Read the book  Great book and very practical advice that can be used in everyday life  One of the oldest and greatest books of strategy used still to this day   fDl trjm   rby  lh knt llstdh ldktwr hshm lmlky Study these tactics because we ll need them    I studied this book for ten years  On the surface  its a simple book of common sense  but like most of Eastern philosophy there is much more to it  If you want to beat your enemy  read this book  Because the chances are  your enemy will use it to beat you    Victory can be known  It cannot be made   Sun Tzu s  The Art of War  is one of the most rational works I have come across to date that deals with conflict management  Written more than 2500 years ago  the wisdom in its verses is still applicable today  Some may argue that  considering it was written for the military  it is only applicable in war  but I would consider them wrong  Conflict has become a part of our everyday existence  We disagree with our colleagues at work  with our peers at school and even with family members at home  However  to effectively manage conflict  one has to look at the bigger picture and bring all parties to view that bigger picture as well  To manage conflict by force of will is the key  not by the force of power  In order to have all parties agree on a matter  a compromise needs to be made  and that situation can only be gathered by observing the  Tao  or the way of things enfolding around us  One has to use the great force of the environment  physical and human to realize the bigger picture and take action in accordance with it  This is  Shih    Shih  is improvisation but not just improvisation  It is the key to everything  One has to note the  Tao  of things around him and then decide the best course of action that uses the force of the environment around  What s more  timing is everything  An action taken too soon or too late will result in nothing but disaster  One has to be patient  gauge out the surroundings  decide the correct course of action and take it at the right time  The most intriguing aspect of the philosophy behind Sun Tzu s work is the idea of victory without battle  Whether it is war or everyday conflict  fighting leads to nothing but a great expenditure of resources and entails nothing but disaster  It could be a legal battle in court or a heavy debate in the board room  It could even be an all out war between two nations  however  the trick is to win over all parties involved and bring them to view things from your perspective  Only such an action could bring lasting victory and a true end to any battle  Lastly  the most important lesson Sun Tzu teaches us is to pick our battles  Every fight is not worth fighting and every battle not worth pursuing  The great wisdom lies in the idea that victory needs to be known before going into battle  One has to know how the fight will be won over before marching into the battlefield  If one knows that the fight is for a lost cause then one must NOT proceed  This shows us that if one is to put our resources into any task  one must know the true outcome one wants to achieve from it  One has to assess whether that outcome can be achieved or not  and proceed only if it can  Otherwise  it is not worth pursuing and will only lead to wastage of a sort that we cannot afford  This book will prove to be a treasure for all and its wisdom will prove immeasurable to anyone facing conflict in any aspect of their lives  Simple  a classic    applicable in many factions of life    everyone should read this book  What an absolute classic  As relevant today as it probably was when it was written  just in a different context hopefully  Who thought a book of military strategy would be as delightful as poetry  Loved the book   This book prepares you for any battle you ll have to face in this life    The most amazing about it is when you think how old it is  And how up to date   invincibility depends on one s self  the enemy s vulnerability depends on him   Bk 4  This was one of my favorite books  The strategies in this book can be used in daily life   un libro che non deve mancare in nessuna libreria  sotto forma di

read this book because I love to read books with history behind them and when I read this book I was over whelmed at how detailed the book was when it explained the strategies used by Sun Tzu and those around him  This book truly is a classic that will be handed down for years to come  I give this book the highest possible rating because of its interesting qualities that it possesses  This is one of the greatest books I have ever read  This book  written by the ancient Chinese pilosopher Sun Tzu  redefined modern warfare  This man wrote the book on how to win a war  but not just in combat  Wars of businesses could be included  I would defininatly reccomend this book to any reader interested in how war has evolved and changes over thousands of years  I was inspired to read this excellent book after reading that he overcame massive armies  A interesting book to say the least  Sun Tzu lived in a time that was  to say the least  primeval in the art of warfare This book relates to several aspects that are still used in conflict today  such as geographical positioning for dominate encampment  influence on troop moral by commanders and the use of allied forces  Though it does contain several elements that are near irrelevant in modern warfare the amount of practical information in it is outstanding  especially for a work of its age  I would only recommend reading this book of you have an interest in warfare  Fantastic Book for me  5 5  lktb dh mhm jdan tdrysh lljywsh klh  bGD lnZr  n sqTt l mthl  l n lktb mn l Swr lqdym   bs fy nSy H kfy  lltTbyq fy kl l zmn   Za mene je ova

que si lo meditas bien pueden aplicarse algunas cosas en la vida diaria  Muy recomendable   Helps you delve into important aspects of Chinese culture and mindset   Sun Tzu teaching can be applied to all walks of life  The caution is to apply his teaching in a defensive mode  not in an offence one  This is a beautiful and scholarly presentation of a truly elegant piece of ancient literature  Griffith puts forth his interpretation of  The Art of War  based on a revision of his Ph D  thesis presented some years ago  Commentaries from several sources are included along side of Griffith s own translation  Footnotes are ubiquitous in the text explaining various discrepancies in interpretations  translations and historical contexts  There is a nicely done introduction discussing various scholarly debates surrounding  The Art of War  including  original authorship  and date of creation   return  return Beyond the content  the presentation of the book is beautiful  The cover is silk

Insightful on the fundementals of warfare and easy to read and understand as well  A great classic full of wisdom that withstands the ages  To read and meditate  Today  we re reviewing the legendary Art of War  a legendary book about military strategy by the general Sun Tzu  The book isn t really in a single genre  it s easily a part of plenty  such as Military Science  with the reason being that The Art of a War is a military tactic book  It doesn t have a main character  but the writing constantly seems to refer to the reader  so I guess you re the main character  It was written in 520 BCE in China  with the author being    Well  Sun Tzu of course  It s purpose is to serve as a guide about how to wage war  and the dos and dont s of warfare as well  It has 13 chapters  each dealing with multiple areas of war  Each chapter speaks of different parts of war  and notes what should be done  what shouldn t be done  and the correct and incorrect strategies of war  Surprisingly  the book isn t a mere celebration of war  it is instead filled with cautions and warnings about what happens if you do not follow Sun Tzu s principles  For example  being too hasty will annihilate you  while not discipline your soldiers makes them utterly useless  as they are equivalent to spoiled children  The book also notes war can only be declared when it s the only option  otherwise it is pointless  It must also be quick  because  as Sun Tzu said   There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare  Do I recommend this book  To quote M  Bison from the Street Fighter movie   OF COURSE   This is a masterpiece of literature  and something that is surprising is the fact that The Art of War isn t being utilized solely by the military  businesses  sports teams  even lawyers use this book  Why  Many of the Art of War s strategies can be utilized in real life  granted  they aren t used violently by civilians  For example  Sun Tzu said   Do not press a desperate foe too hard   This can be interpreted as   Don t keep pestering someone who is upset   which is a valuable life skill  Overall  the Art of War should be on your bucket list  and if it isn t  you re missing out big time  Thoroughly enjoyed this book  Read it every year  The thing about this book that is so brilliant is the fact that all the tactics and lessons Sun Tzu discusses are applicable to any type of conflict that is imaginable  not just in war and battle  I m not saying the book provides complete specific answers to any type of conflict  but it does provide ideas that make you think more logically about solving a conflict on hand  Some of the advice appeals to the psychological factors  some appeal to the physical factors  This is the reason why the book is useful in terms of serving as a starting read to give ideas and push for people to think about how they deal with their problems  Where it doesn t give a single instruction on what to do  it tells you factors you should consider  what factors you shouldn t consider and how your decisions will affect direction of the outcome  The even better thing is that he explains each strategy with common sense and simple terms that make it very easy for you to understand the main idea of something  By using common sense and easy to apply lessons  Sun Tzu has written the ultimate strategy book to solve any conflict  of pretty much anything  serious or not  political or personal  personal or otherwise  Genial  Para leerlo una y otra vez y aplicar estrategias de guerra en todo lo que hagas  D  i really want to read this because Sun Tzu was the greatest leader evr                 Re read at least 5x in the past 10 years  Great study on human nature  Short  brilliant  precise  wise  It gives very detailed advices on leading a war  most of them  as they are related to discipline  research  planning and patience  can be used in everyday life  to some extent  Covers such topics as choosing the location of the battle  choosing whether to attack or not  choosing whether to set fires and what to set them on  how to lead people and take care of them  not just your own people  but also the opponent people too    Great Read for those who like to plan ahead for  battles  with thy self and with others  Strategy of warfare  These strategies can be used for actual war  school  or the office   if we can turn every lesson of it to our normal life we can achieve alot  Didn t realize it was so short  Found the audiobook on itunes for a couple of bucks and decided to give it a listen  Other than the reader sounding like a  70s game show host  thought it was really interesting  Leanlo  aplica para todo A very short  easy read that nevertheless packs quite the philosophical punch   His is definitely not a book you can full take in and appreciate all it has to offer in just one reading  I will most likely have to read again and again to full take in all it has to offer Really awesome book though  Drwr  mlH  lkl shkhS Awesome  I still can t wait for the day when I can finally use Sun Tzu s teachings to me  This book is timeless  Sempre actual  Brilhante   My book was the Art of War by Sunzi bingfa  I did not finish it but I will give you my best of what I read  as I read the Art of War  I learn that war is based upon strategy  You have to be at the place where your enemy will not see or suspect you to be at   The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting      Sun Tzu  The Art of War  You need to try to outsmart your enemy with out killing your self   The art of war is importance to the state  It is a matter of life and death  a road either to safety or to ruin  It is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected   So begins The Art of War  the rules of war that was first published in China  Historians don t know the exact date of the book s publication in fact  they don t even know who wrote it  The Art of War s author was a Chinese military leader named Sun Tzu  or Sunzi  Today  Sun Tzu who wrote use the book as a compilation of generations of Chinese theories and teachings on military strategy  Whether or not Sun Tzu was a real person  it s clear that  he  was very wise  The Art of War still resonates with readers today  The point of the book was to help with war  By giving the best strategies known to man  and help with the teaching of winning the war   If you know the enemy and know yourself  you need not fear the result of a hundred battles  If you know yourself but not the enemy  for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat  If you know neither the enemy nor yourself  you will succumb in every battle      Sun Tzu  The Art of War  That is the point of the story always know what your capable of doing and focus on doing the little things right  And everything else will fallen to place like it is supposed to   I loved the book so far  I m try finishing it because it you can use everything in the book not just on war  But in everyday life  by learning strategies to pass the big test or even help with a football game  I like how the book gives really good detail about everything the author is talking about  It is incredible that the military use this book to help with combat  I would recommend this book to my brother because he is a war person  And this teaches you how to be ready for war and teaches how to stay alive  He would like this book after he learns a little more about war and then reading this will most likely give him everything he will need to fight in combat  A cornerstone of leadership and strategy  Maintains the position of most unlikely book to be on its place on my book shelf   I like to come back to this book as often as possible  reflecting my current situation and means of life  Simplistic  intriguing  as eternal as a book can be  Classical and base knowledge of tactics and military discipline  Useful for the strategic mind to meditate on the root cause  Once the reader has a good answer for each fact stated in the book the mind should be able to think thoroughly through problem of business  and life  You can say it as an epic for tactics and strategy making  A marvelous and must read for those who seek to be great leaders    This is one of those books that one reads it every day to understand the nuances mentioned  Thomas Cleary translation is my favourite because he has not influenced the transcript in any manner  Thus Sun Tzu is a must read for everybody  everyday to help them develop a strategy towards life      The Art Of War  Sun Tzu was a Chinese general and strategist from the kingdom of Wu  in Eastern China  He was born on 544 BC and died on 496 BC  The book was originally written vertically on chopsticks about 1 inch think  It is said that he wrote the book while he was in exile after helping the ruler of Wu defeat against all odds the army of the kingdom of Chu  As well as conquer their capital  It is very hard to depict the strengths of the book  because of the way it is written  There is also no way to know how much was lost with the translation  if any   What I can say for a fact is even though it didn t leave you with any kind of hunger to know what was coming next  I always felt like I was learning and feeding my mind  and I felt a sense of satisfaction after reading it  Never did I think that it was giving me useless information  I felt it accomplished this quite nicely  This proves that the book  is in fact  timeless  The only way I can summarize the book is to explain how it is composed  It is divided into 13 different sections  each depicting and including tips for that specific section  For example  in the section Maneuvering armies he says  Where there are hills  keep on their sunny side  with them to your right rear  Thousands of years after it was written it is still relevant  which is quite impressive to be honest  For example  one of his most famous quotes is  Every battle is won before it is fought   is still relevant  and not only in one field of knowledge  in many  It basically means to know what you are up against and scout properly  it applies many things besides war  sports  for example  you must correctly scout the opposing team to know their strengths and weaknesses  Know your own weaknesses and strengths as well  That way the battle is won before it is even fought  In the end  The Art of War is truly timeless and it still nourishes the mind  Useful for countless jobs and for life in general  Thousands of years after it s creation  Master Sun s most important teaching  To win 100 battles is not the height of skill to subdue the enemy without fighting is   is still pertinent  and it always will be  Personally  I was rather surprised at how small the actual Art of War treatise was It  specifically  is not a very long text However  I feel this book adds a fantastic extra layer of pages and understanding  taking into account the historical  cultural  philosophical  military differences that the reader might be faced with in respect to Chinese literature This translation was fantastic  and easily comprehensible  and I very much appreciate the fact that this particular translation takes all the most recent architectural findings into account This book has really opened my eyes to some of the fundamental differences between Eastern and Western thinking I am eager to read more Oriental classic texts and expand my knowledge in completely new ways  Major Characters Sun TzuThemes Military StrategySelf ConceptionAvoidance of Evil It had been a long time since I d read Sun Tzu  And though I remembered it as an excellent book  I didn t much remember the contents  And what a pity that was  Not only is it an intelligent book  it is also extremely practical  Sun Tzu accomplishes an enormous task under 200 pages  laying out the general and specific principles that govern war  Of course  the original text itself is a bit ambiguous in places  owing to corruption over the years and the intricacies of the Chinese language  coupled with Sun Tzu s colourful analogies and metaphors   but Sun Tzu successfully enumerated the principles that would lead a belligerent to victory  then and now  Lionel Giles  commentary and translations are a delight  offering other Chinese authorities  interpolations of the text  and allowing the reader excellent insights and modern day examples of Sun Tzu s principles being upheld in war  alongside snippets of wisdom straight from the likes of the Duke of Wellington and Stonewall Jackson brilliant  amazing insight with the content being relevant even today  if you are involved in politics  business  military or history read it  it can even apply to modern day life well worth a read Clear translationThis is a clear translation of the original work  It is easy to read and even easier to comprehend  Highly recommended  Great read  Since the principles are concise  it does take a lot of self reflection to discover how each principle applies to your own life I have a pocket Art of War and read a few principles a day just to refresh   I read Diffrent Version but my review is for the content of Sun Tzu Book Still

read this book  It s unbelievable that is written hundred years ago Sun Tzu wrote so many truths  which they are still exist His book show us today simply how we are making mistatek  Its a magnificent book those who want to be  1 must read this book    A fascinating 2000 year old text that offers still relevant advice on leadership  foreward thinking  and cunning One of the greatest lessons emphasized in this book is to avoid war at all cost  but to treat it as a necessary evil when no other option is available  Sun Tzu also advices to avoid unnecessary bloodshed  preserve captured cities  as they are worth more in working order then burnt ash  He also emphasizes that you use everything to your advantage  from terrain  battle formations  to your enemy s weakness  For example  converting your enemy s spies to your side via bribery  Winning a war is not accomplished by strength and intellegance alone  but by remaining steps ahead of the enemy  In order to get ahead  one must be level headed  have the trust and respect of their subordinates  and most importantly  have knowledge  spies   Analyze the enemy so that you may interpret accurately what words may not convey but body language betrays  Knowledge is power and knowing your enemy as you know yourself guarantees victory  Overall a good read with a wealth of knowledge to offer  but no detailed tactics  mainly advice   Definitely recommend it  Um livro para toda vida   Interesting read  I like the logical and strategic process of his outline on how to crush your enemies   This classic of Chinese military philosophy has been used as a guide to military and business tacticians  alike  The ideas contained within the book are not reserved for military commanders and business executives  Rather  Sun Tzu s ideas are helpful to a person trying to buy a car  a house   this  bushel of potatoes rather than  that  bushel of potatoes  walking through a questionable neighborhood  being victimized by inter office politics  running for a local school board  or trying to convince one s significant other to take out the garbage  Taken as a  method of living   it also goes a long way to helping one avoid the  beige hell  that often accompanies age and growing comfortable in our space  That is to say  Sun Tzu s philosophical side can help us shake up the nest and live a little This edition of the book contains commentary by Ralph Sawyer  whose insights  explanation  and delineation of Sun Tzu s ideas is pretty enlightening  I don t always agree with him  but his tone suggests that everyone may not  and that he doesn t mind  The book contains The Art of War  but also Military Methods  by Sun Pin  a follower of Sun Tzu  whom the editor argues may have either been a contemporary  or that they may have been the same person  Either way  the texts work so well together that  to read Tzu  one must read Pin  The are both enlightening  and the edition is quite wonderful  i just love this book   i carry it wherever i go   lol  makes be want to be brave and take on life with all it brings Todos os administradores assim como eu devem ler esse livro  One of the most compelling and highly utilized and studied works of tactical strategy that one can discover  Individuals from all walks of life today as well as throughout history have had this philosophical masterpiece in their resume  The writing is surprising simplistic and straight forward and is very relevant on numerous applications  I highly recommend this  Great lessons that can be applied to everyday life    Absolutely amazing and his techniques are timeless  A lot of  the Art of War  has practical  everyday applications  daily life is a battlefield  I love this book learned a lot of stuff I gave it 5 stars  3  Very useful book  I m glad we read it in college  If you would like to re think your strategies in surviving life here s a book for you  Great classical strategic read  Sadly it is the English version  something must have been lost in translation  Note to self  Find the old Chinese version  The Art of War  by Sun Tzu is an easy yet interesting read  Once you really start to dig into it you realize that a lot of the thoughts and ideas are applicable to becoming a successful person in life  But caution should be taken before doing so because it is first and foremost a book of military strategy and making it to personally applicable can make you a hard  crass  deceitful person  Especially the chapter on espionage  Sun Tzu  from the writings and commentary in the book seemed to value life  discourage rashness and not to act on the whims of a bloodthirsty  vengeful or greedy ruler  This is good advice for any good general  as well as any half way decent human being  Easy to understand  but I suspect that there is many more than what is uttered with mere words in this book  lys ktban blm n  lm hwd  bl hw  kthr mn dhlk  n tjd ktban bhdh lqidam whdhh lbsT  fy l slwb  l ly wufiqt fy khtyr

it both concisely and persuasively  The author s  responsible for the Art of War did just that  Clear and simple  Sun Tzu s lesson s work in all sorts of conflict   not out of date by any means  should have been read by George W Bush s war cabinet before invading Iraq   The Art of War  is a classic book  read by countless people around the world  It s lessons have universal application  not only to military tactics  but to business  leadership  and  ultimately  life  Sun Tzu s genius is complemented by examples of battles throughout history that are specific to his lessons  The teachings of this book could spell success in life for those who use them correctly The style of this book is mainly instructional  The lessons are divided up into sections that are in order in they way Sun Tzu felt the topics needed to be considered before a war  While the lessons were inteneded to be military tutorial  the wording allows for easy translation into infinite aspects of life  If any are hard to understand  this confusion is cleared up by the examples that use each tactic To those who are in a position a of leadership  read this book  The lessons will not only give you information on how to be successful  but also supply you with the confidence to lead  Anyone that likes philosphy of any kind  like me  will enjoy this book as well  Very useful to this day   in many ways even outside of war  Recommended for anyone who values insight into the many strategies and tactics of all our lives  You get told that there are some books in life you HAVE to read  this is definitely one  It s informative and whilst not wholly relevant nowadays  vast tracts of the writings still have applications in this day and age  It will give you a valuable insight into conflict  not just literal  but that which we face most days in any guide  The Art of War  instead of being read  has to be studied  It s not for everyone  Be ready to get inside the mind of a Chinese warrior that lived more than two thousand years ago  Amazing ideas that can be applied to everyday situations in regards to conflicts and leadership  I loved the prologue and footnotes from Jose Luis Trueba Lara made on the edition that I purchased  Lots of useful strategies that can be applied in all manner of contexts  I haven t managed to finish it  as it s one of those books you need to read a bit of then meditate on   The clarity of the mind presenting the principles in this book is evident over 2000 years later  Ideas such as  not wasting effort on the battles that don t matter so that you have the strengths for the ones that do  and  every battle is won or lost before it s fought   and others  impart a practical wisdom to the reader  I like it    A timeless classic this book is great for any situation  everyone should read it  gw sebenernya bukan baca buku yang ini  tapi baca buku versi komik dalam bahasa Indonesia  en karya Sun Tzu ini bayak ngebuka wawasan gw   bila telah menjalankan perang  maka teruskanlah  jangan berhenti di tengah jalan   Very tactical suggestion for the engagement with enemies  Though it s a good translation  But I am sure the original book in Chinese context would be more awesome  Highly recommended for strategists like me   This was an incredibly interesting book  It s basically structured so that Sun Tzu presents an aspect of strategy  and then several strategists of that time give a broader explanation and sometimes use metaphors or stories to go into more detail This book covers a wide variety of military strategies and things to take into account  Though written long ago  it s still possible to translate the things in this book to modern warfare  I would definitely recommend it if you re interested in the details of war and the wide array of strategies behind it  or if you were someone looking to become an officer in the military or you play tabletop games such as Warhammer or Heroscape  This is a very good book if you have a mindset to change    Es mejor no pelear pero cuando te ves en la necesidad de hacerlo hazlo para ganar  una de las mejores frases de este libro  To those without a business background  this book may seem confusing  Sun Tzu s book is about military strategy  It is most suited for generals  But there is much in common between military strategy and business strategy  After all  business does possess many of the same characteristics as warfare  you battle competitors to gain customers it s a zero sum game   Sun Tzu begins talking about the five heads that all generals  and business people  need to be familiar with 1  Moral Law2  Heaven3  Earth 4  Commander Skills5  Discipline and methodMoral law in warfare is about having soldiers loyal to state  it s about having soldiers who are willing to put themselves in harms way and die for your success  In business  this is the equivalent of having loyal  hardworking employees and business partners who are motivated to work their best for the good of the company  Heaven  in warfare is about keeping in mind the seasons  are you fighting in winter  spring  etc   In business  this is the equivalent of understanding legislative  regulatory  economic  and technological trends that will affect your business  For example  will new technology make your business obsolete  Will a new law be passed by congress that proves unfavorable to your business Earth in warfare is about understanding distances and terrains in battle  In business  it s about understanding your competition  suppliers  customers  etc  It s about understanding the landscape you are entering  Commander skill and discipline are self explanatory  Overall  this is a great book if you tie it to business principles  Much of what Sun Tzu discussed ties in directly to business  The only downside is that the book is not explicit  Sun Tzu uses many metaphors and military definitions that you must analyze through a business perspective  For example  will there be a new law passed by congress that will damage This book was written some 2 000 years ago in China  It is the first attempt to a rational basisfor the planning and conduct of military operations   An excellent philosophy of military strategy  Dated  but has aged extremely well  Very insightful  Every sentence is of worth  Not a single word is wasted  Read any chapter as a standalone  A classic  A must read  Really a must re read as well   The Art of War is an amazing need to read book  Art of War is a fantastic book about how to overcome different situations with specific solutions  Learn so much knowledge and wisdom from Sun Tzu who translated multiple ancient scripts written by great and knowledgeable prophets  While reading this book  you will come across certain tactics that can apply to your everyday life  When you read this book you will not understand some of the wording because it was written way back in the day  however  while reading this book you allow yourself to learn knew and intellectual words  Discover the world and art of war from this mind boggling book   It s not just for the war  it for all the areas of the life  it was a unique experience timeless mind blowing

consider this to be essential reading  For everyone  In business  the strategic concepts are easily translated  In personal life  it helps to understand and deal with conflict situations  Combined with A Book of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi and The Unfettered Mind by Takuan Soho  this is part of a set that I frequently give to people   Sun Tzu said  The art of war is of vital importance to the state It would not be unfair to say that the Art of War is generally considered to be a  must read  book recommended to philosophers  students  business leaders and politicians alike  It is certainly deserving of this high esteem In the Chinese philosophical canon there are two main branches  Both originated in China around the 5th century BC and have permeated the society  religion and politics every since  These two groups are Taoism and Confucianism  Although they share some core concepts  notably the idea of the Way  they are in many ways separate  This blog is actually named after a quote from the Tao Te Ching  the key philosophical work of Taoism and I have a great reverence for the philosophy as a guide as well as it s inherent spirit  The Art of War is a taoist work and this shines through both in it s style of telling as well as it s advice  Let your rapidity be that of the wind  your compactness that of the forest In raiding and plundering like fire  in immovability like a mountain Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night  and when you move  fall like a thunderbolt  The book is unmistakably about how to defeat ones enemy s  Although there is some general life advice to be found  it is with this purpose in mind that the book was written and it is in pursuing victory over ones foes that the most benefit will be found in its reading  In Battle  there are not more than two methods of attack  the direct and the indirect  yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers  The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn  It is like moving in a circle  you never come to an end  Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination  There are a number of chapters that deal with more specific aspects of war such as  the use or misuse of geography and the economic costs of different activity s  However  the majority is much more general and can be applied to almost any field in which one has to engage in combat  Although there is much to be learned from Sun Tzu s I feel that there are two key takeaways that should be internalized by anyone engaged in conflict  The first is that  The Art of War is the art of deception The surest path to victory is through appearing as one is not and acting as one is not expected  Bait the enemy with traps  make your forces appear weak when they are strong  obscure your plans so that the opponent can have no knowledge of your actions before you take them  These and similar principles are the fundamentals of brining about victory  It is very telling that the last chapter of the book deals with spies and how to best learn about the moves of the enemy as Sun Tzu commands  Be subtle  Be subtle  and use your spies for every kind of business   Almost as important as learning everything you can about the enemy s movements is to feed him false information and make yourself opaque to the same tactics  In war practice dissimulation and you will succeed   By doing these things you will keep you adversary in a constant state of confusion and apprehension unable to prepare adequately for any move that you may make  Which leads to the second important point  To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands  but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself  Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat  but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy  Hence the saying  One may know how to conquer without being able to do it  Although the practices mentioned above will be the cause of your victory they are pointless if you cannot make sure that you will not first be defeated  And it is this step that is in fact the only thing that is fully in your control  While you may be able to fight better and use tactics to win a battle if the enemy is also skilled or has a force that is much larger then your own then you cannot be sure of victory  In all instances  however  you are able to guard against defeat and this is done through the five key aspects of battle   Morals  Heaven  Earth  The Commander  Order and DisciplineSun Tzu deals with the problems of Heaven luck  and Earth physical circumstances  separately and I don t think they are as worth a further examination here  The other three however are what any leader must keep in mind at all times during warfare  Firstly  he should make sure that he and his soldiers troops  employees  allies  are in accord with the moral nature of their purpose  In a word they must understand that they are  fighting the good fight  with this on their side the army will be imbued with a super human strength and will sooner die then surrender  Secondly  good order and discipline must be maintained and is dependent on the organization and treatment of ones troops  it is through the proper giving of rewards and punishments that this should be achieved  The last  and most important aspect is the commander  You There are many admonishments throughout the book that the good commander should heed  however I want here to reproduce the five faults that Sun Tzu considers the prime parties responsible for the failure of any leader  as it is mainly through avoiding these that you can ensure you do not fall prey to the enemy 1  Recklessness  which leads to destruction2  Cowardice  which leads to capture3  A Hasty Temper  which makes one provokable by insults4  Delicacy of Honor  which makes one sensitive to shame5  Over Solicitude For His Men  which exposes him to worry and troubleWithin these two categories  understanding the art of deception and the mastering of one s own force lie the seeds of victory  These are discussed in greater detail in the book itself and the Art of War is truly more complex and detailed then these two alone  however they are the core upon which all of the rest is built  I am not going to go into the other sections of the book partly as it is a very short read and you can finish it in a day or two if you are really interested  However  I will here put down the most standout quotes to give an indication of the magnitude of the work  supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy s resistance without fighting  So in war  the way is to avoid what is strong and attack what is weak  It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on   If you are facing an opponent in any field be it business  sport or anything else then this book will provide for you the perfect starting manual on how to defeat them   If you know the enemy and know yourself  your victory will not stand in doubt  if you know Heaven and know Earth  you may make your victory complete  Very compelling and powerful read  There is so much to be glean from these pages that can be applied in varying aspects of our lives  I definitely recommend this as a must read to all   Now I m ready to invade Poland   Okay  I understand that is not the kind of reaction Sun Tzu would have liked best victories are won without fighting  but it makes a nice heading  His philosophy is simple   be good even if it means looking bad and to know your surroundings while you fight  He is against pretentious heroism  plunder or useless bloodshed whether that is blood of his own men or his opponents  Yet he wants you not to miss the opportunities where you can find them or to break the old moral laws where it is of advantage to you Not that I m looking to lead an army or pretend that I can but there is something so honest in there that you just love it  Perhaps it is book s realism  as against the bookish morality    something comparable to Machiavelli s  The Prince    This is a book I will revisit for years to come  A great book for any strategist   Very necessary and vital for any success in life  Simply GREAT  5 out of 5  This is required reading in my opinion   An enlightenment book  The Art of War is a military classic written by Sun Tzu in the warring states period of china s history  The book is filled with military and philosophical truths and strategies  The principals in the Art of War are still used in business and our armed forces today  It gives ways to engage an enemy but also to avoid him  her  It is one of the first known written methods of warfare and is still the most popular book of its genre  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a strategic field  People of all ages will enjoy this timeless classic  I thought this book was very interesting and a nice addition to my repertoire of knowledge  Generally translations of the book come with a lengthy and complicated introduction  so I would recommend having a reading buddy if you want to tackle that  This warlike King thoroughly enjoyed this book   This is a very interesting book  It talks about how to defeat your opponent in battle and some battle tactics  I read the book because I thought it might help me with a video game I was playing  Also  I am really interested in war tactics  Sun Tzu s tactics were used around the world at his time  and were used to truly win battles  The specific version of the book I read had a little snipet here and there on how to apply Tzu s war strategies to businesses in the modern days  It was really interesting to see how they were interconnected  All in all  read the book   Quite a while back I decided that there are certain books out there in this big wide world that I have to at least try to read before I die  a bucket list of books  I haven t officially made a list on paper  it s just a small part of my mind sectioned off to remind me when I come across one  This one here definitely fell on that list  and a few months back I happened upon it and knew it was time to check it off My first snag was the fact the copy I picked up contained other books as well  so adding it to my reading shelf was a bit of a challenge  I quickly discovered that there are so many copies available with different add ons that I finally just went with a selection that only contained this book without all the fluff  I swear it took me longer to sort this mess out then it did to actually read the damn book On to my review or should I say thoughts Initially I found myself thinking   What the heck is the deal with this one  This book is total common sense   Then it hit me  this book is ancient  most likely making the concepts it introduced revolutionary for their time  These concepts probably went on to affect the history between our times in ways my little pea brain can t even begin to comprehend  I use the terms  most likely  and  probably  because my knowledge in these matters is extremely limited  Taking the time to research it all does pique my interest  but honestly not at this time  So in the mind files it goes to be addressed at a later date Do I necessarily have to enjoy the read  No  Do I just need to appreciate the book for what it is  a piece of history  Hell yes    and that my friends  sums it all up  powerful guide to winning    great book and incredibly useful in strategy games Outstanding book    read cover to cover in two days  It s about life  how to live wisely  the books contents a rules valid for any physical situation  not just a war The writer did not explain the points deeply  so you must use your oral while reading  this book is not just about war but about life  a must read A  must read It s a book everyone we have to read  but also analyse to make profit of its words  Does one really need to put a review to the Art of War  Its prevalence and application to all things life says a great deal that cannot be easily translated into words   nor need it In base and elegant terms  this outlines war and life strategy  It is the Art of War   The greatest victory is that which requires no battle   What an amazing book full of cunning and strategy  I gleaned great knowledge from Sun Tzu on patience and the art of making your move at a calculated time and place  be it asking for a raise or taking down the Xia Dynasty   I ve read quite a few reviews for this book claiming  The Art of War  is simply that   a book about war  And that it can t be used in a modern setting   to them I say  Engage people with what they expect  it is what they are able to discern that confirms their projections  It settles them into predictable patterns of response  occupying their minds while you wait for the extraordinary moment    that which they cannot anticipate  BOOM  Prime time manipulation from a book older than Jesus   The Art of War  ladies and gentlemen    I initially read this book to help with management techniques for business school but find that it applies to every day life quite well  The advice of Sun Tzu is both memorable and easy to apply   Classic   Very interesting and easy to read  Commentary at the back was superb with many stories about Chinese generals  A must read The text is split into short easy  bullet points  almost  which have a narrative running through each individual chapter Would be a useful reference for those writing novels stories etc  set in historical periods  especially as a tactics guide  Also very interesting for general reading  Another book that will enrich your life  Read it and wait 5 years and read it again  Good book  everyone should read it  Gives insights on how we should run the war in Iraq  Fantastic What could I possibly say about this book that hasn t already been said  It is1  Adaptable to any conflict situation  war  negotiation  hostile takeover  divorce    2  The actions of the most successful generals of ancient times  like Hannibal Barca  mirror Sun Tzu s advice despite the fact that they had no access to the book  This proves the practical and fundamental nature of this book  that otherwise can only be gained through painful experience  3  Historians still debate if Sun Tzu was a man or a group of men  or if he even existed  Post script  one of the most insightful chapters is the final chapter which addresses Espionage and how a general should use and protect against it   For a book written so long ago  this book is remarkably insightful and relevant today perhaps not so much to the military strategist  but most definitely to a dedicated real time strategy games player     I imagine this book is great for war strategy   at least  it seems that way  The only reason I think that is because as I read it  I couldn t help thinking how bad this information would be in the hands of one who wanted the advantage over his or her spouse  Good for war  bad for marriage  I have to say there is something refreshing about eastern wisdom  even when it is eastern wisdom about war  The book is excellent in writing with very lucid explanations of principles put forward by the great Sun Tzu  Many of the explanations can be related to the ordinary life while some are strictly pertained to the war  Overall the book gives you the feeling of enlightenment after reading it   La bible  que le militaire qui ne l a pas lu sorte   I have several editions by various translators as well as an audio CD  Each is a little different  This is a  how to  book for living  Should be required reading for all teenagers  MO 6 yy da yasamis Sun Tzu nun insanlik tarihinin en eski ve en fazla tartisilan

makes sense  Amazing  Is a great book to read An excellent  informative book  Contains practical tactics as well as goes into physcological details about the study of war  This definitely deserves a re read   This book laid the foundation to the modern art of war  Many of its teachings are still applicable today not only in actual wars but in invidual battles we each face  Actually I m new to militaristic literature and the 13 chapters of this book actually gave me good ideas and tips  and in my opinion in works in battles and civil life  this rating of mine may change by time  A thought inspiring set of work that I will do my utmost to learn from If you love watching top sports teams and wonder about their philosophies and path to victories   it s all in here and can be applied to other facets of life  The rules seem simplistic and obvious but if you watch top performers that s how they view their path to success too  I saw this book at a book store and I immediately check the contents  I would love to have my own copy but unfortunately the one I am reading is a hardbound and that makes it expensive  I just read the book inside the bookstore  yes  we do that in our country   There are times I found myself agreeing saying  OHH  and  AHH   sometimes I am in deep thought because some of his words are profound  One factor why I am fascinated by this book is because like history People may think that what he is saying in the book is already known like  If your enemy is secure at all points  be prepared for him  If he is in superior strength  evade him    It is indeed common sense but be reminded that during his time  this thought idea may not be that common  Which definitely makes the teachings precious and genius  Since I read this really fast  not days  it just took an hour or so because this is just a quick read I would like to read it again and write a proper review some time   AmazingThis book is a essential read for manager  military men and leaders anywhere is book is amazing and can be used in any instance of leading people anywhere in the world today  Some advice is outdated  unless you re concerned about how much silver you need to maintain your chariots  but overall this book has simple and poignant observations of what makes a good leader  This is as applicable in ancient Chinese warfare as it is in a modern day office  where there is inevitably a chain of command  and competition  be it for territory or for stock shares I also had a good laugh when he sternly advised against long  drawn out wars with no quick resolution because hey oooo what have we been doing in the Middle East  Looks like our politicians could learn a thing or two from Sun Tzu  I found this as a free ebook on my new droid and was thrilled as I don t have lots of money for this kind of nonsense at present  I ve always wanted to read this book and had that desire multiply when Tony Soprano quoted it oh so many years ago  Never would ve bought it  Too short  but what a great find for free  Lots of pearls of wisdom  Read this over and over  Put it on audiobook and read it in your sleep  AmazingI would recommend this product for anyone trying to attain an assertive grasp on their dominance in the workforce  or in life  Sun Tzu eloquently defines all the key elements used to master the art of any war we may face  Applying his teachings has helped me soar above my competitors with no contest  A good read for anyone  really  Five stars   Learn how to be a spy and kill people  Spies are all you need There is no avoidable war  All what you can do is te report it  in the profit of your opponent  sun tzu show power that you have but you never realize if you want to beat you re enemy you have know them as good as you re self  I will probably never  finish  this one  I continuously read this  great bathroom book  This book is a must read because  even though it is a very old book  it includes tactics and principles in war that still can be used today  People still use it for advice on war tactics  such as Viet Minh commanders Vo Nguyen Giap and Ho Chi Minh and American Gulf War generals Norman Schwarzkopf and Colin Powell  It is also a good way to look into China s ancient culture  Besides using it as a guide to military tactics  it can even be used to win negotiations and trials  The underlying principles to any conflict  whether it be war  a battle  a skirmish  or just a typical argument  are the same  This is an engaging read   Brilliant It s really not that long    read it if you haven t already  p Great book  helped me plan ahead a lot efficiently and effectively  9 10  I highly enjoyed this book  I read the Giles translation for a college Ancient Chinese philosophy course  I must admit that 80  of my enjoyment was due to the amazing professor I had   he was able to stimulate my interest in a subject I otherwise would have had no interest in  I only took the course for requirement   and to explain Sun Tzu s philosophy in an understandable manner  But even without a great professor  the writings of Sun Tzu on the art of war is refreshingly wise and applicable   to war as well as to life in general  It s a pretty fast read  and well worth the effort  this book change my life way   i think strategies of the war game can be used in people life  how they plan  decide and act   One of the greatest books yet I have read  The Art of War by Sun Tzu is such a original book that I think many people should read because of this book being the progression of war  What the plot was about in this book was the tactics that people used in war  Not only smart tactics that they used but also tactics that weren t always the brightest  By doing this  this book also explained how the progression of war happened  This book was just a great book if you wanted to read about the tactics of war or for just entertainment purposes  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a book about tactics of war or just to read  I think anyone would like this book if they payed attention to it and read about it  What I liked about this book was that it was meant to be read for two purposes  There was nothing in this book I disliked   En apariencia  compendio de tactica y estrategia militar  sin embargo   El arte de la guerra  es mucho mas  Es un tratado de psicologia lo mismo que de antropologia filosofica  En cada epigrafe de Sun Tzu hay una lectura oculta  una significacion soterrada que generaliza sus planteamiento y los universaliza del terreno belico al de la accion humana en su globalidad  Incluso si se diera  por hipotesis  la ausencia de esa lectura oculta  el libro ya seria del maximo interes para comprender la mentalidad militar de la epoca en la antigua China  Con la existencia de esas significaciones  como de hecho se da  este libro se convierte en una lectura obligada  Obviously it s a great work put together ages ago  It s highly adaptable across various applications in life whether it is acutal warfare or in the business setting  I think the real beauty of the work as a whole is it s brevity and clarity  Each point is concisely presented without belaboring any particular section  Great book  a must read for any manager  one of the best books I ve ever read  just be careful of the translator  There are some really horrendous editions out there  ALWAYS buy the one translated by  CLEARLY  he is very profound in eastern philosophy and tradition A true classic book of strategy  This is used extensively in business today  and it s excellent for that  but I used it for something far more direct  saber fencing  It s an excellent  useful  and practical guide for combat of all kinds  This book provides incredible insight on the wise ways to wage war  What is more intriguing is how it directly applies to everyday life  This is a book to study and not just read through  It will teach you how to pay attention to the acts and words of others to perceive their motives  and also how to utilize your own words and deeds toward others  This book  I have no doubt  has the power to make you a wiser person  One cannot understand peace until they understand war  if you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the result of a hundred battles war business and politics all the same   The Art of War is a Chinese military treatise that was written during the 6th century BC by Sun Tzu  Composed of 13 chapters  each of which is devoted to one aspect of warfare  it has long been praised as the definitive work on military strategies and tactics of its time The Art of War is one of the oldest books on military strategy in the world  It is the first and one of the most successful works on strategy and has had a huge influence on Eastern and Western military thinking  business tactics  and beyond  Sun Tzu was the first to recognize the importance of positioning in strategy and that position is affected both by objective conditions in the physical environment and the subjective opinions of competitive actors in that environment  He taught that strategy was not planning in the sense of working through a to do list  but rather that it requires quick and appropriate responses to changing conditions  Planning works in a controlled environment  but in a competitive environment  Amazing        It offers many thought provoking ideas as well as some lessons  not just about war  but applicable to other areas of life  i have read this book to many time to count and find that it is as relative in dealing with people as it is planning the tactics of battle  some of the more recent translations truly bring a far greater enlightening to this valuable teaching  Buy this book it is a must OWN  For those of you with a clear mind  and the ability to apply wisdom to everyday situations it is a great read  But  a word to the wise do not read this book as you would read any other book  Reading the Art of War is a test in patience within it s self  You must meditate on it s meaning and look for meaning within the words   Must read for anyone planning on living in this world  This military classic that has been around for centuries  can have much meaning to those who read it  Although I did not read the introduction or insights by the author  Ralph D  Sawyer  the layout was nice with a massive bibliography in the back of the book   This book is required reading to complete certain MCIs  While I wouldn t call it an  Art   Sun Tzu explains the  science  behind war  mentalities and strategy  I read this book along side two others  Machiavelli s The Prince  and the DoD s Command and Control  This book was also required reading during a course on the former Soviet Union  though I m not sure why  Stalin certainly would NOT have been a fan of this book  This is a great tactical book for hippies  because it explains in great detail why war is so necessary  yet only a last resort  It should be a staple of all Humanities programmes  Sun Tzu doesn t wax about war with a throbbing poetic erection  he merely tells you how to conduct yourself honourably  swiftly  and thoroughly in situations where confrontation is unavoidable  Think of it as encased  with a sign reading  In case of emergency  break glass   Hopefully  however  in the event of a real confrontation you ll have time to read the book   To be honest  I listened to this audio book for one major reason  it is praised for its views towards war  In short  I am not disappointed by what this audio book has presented for it makes absolute sense on many of the concepts of warfare described in this book  I also understand the history behind on why it is such a famous book for it pertains to the history of the book itself  Sun Tzu wrote this book back in ancient Oriental times when information was limited to travel on horseback or carriage and access to such information was limited by status of one s person  Many modern readers today may say they don t understand why this book is so popular and praised yet they re probably seeing everything on terms of how we live today The first big thing I must bring up is easily the details of common sense in the book  War is all about deception and in any warfare  that is true  However  there is also conduct and rules on what must be done during war beyond the battlefield but also the economical and political  There is always more to war than just slashing swords and killing people  Nevertheless  the audio book does an excellent job describing exactly what Sun Tzu was trying to express in his Art of War The extras are probably fodder to some but can be worth it to those who love history as a form of entertainment  On this audio book there are extra tracks that describe the history part of the making and writing and distribution of The Art of War  This also includes the history of how it has survived for so many years  I do like this and find it appealing for my intelligence but it is unnecessary if all you want to know is the actual study of war itself  All in all  a great read for those who can see every factor on why it is so good  I gave it a perfect score for what it was  True military has changed but the basic principles have not   and a las  it is the basic principles which have seemed to be forgotten in war today  Very clever  More or less  the ancient Chinese guidebook on being a man soldier with common sense  Very applicable  Great look into strategy and war making  It is very applicable even today  Very good read for a look into the history of war   Long on my TBR list  this classic is worth reading  In the Art of War  Sun Tzu s main goal is to portray the height of intelligence that comes from staying away from any sort of battle  He doesn t try to make someone weary of battle  but implies that if a person looks into the situation properly he or she will not have to physically fight  but use their mind to beat the other person  Sun Tzu also tells that each captain or general should always be ready for every possible circumstance  Each general should be able to view all signs of a battle  and also have the intelligence to follow the rules that he sets forth in his book  Much about this novel is true and very applicable to life  When reading this book  one will see that the rules Sun Tzu lays out for battle are not only successful at war  but also when one tries to gain peace for the world  War itself is never peaceful and often the goal is to achieve a status of power  but Sun Tzu s novel shows us tactics on how to outsmart the opponent without enforcing violence  Leaders that create a sense of fear into their enemies eyes are not admirable  They are damaging to the peace and should not be leaders of their countries  Anyone who is interested in managing a group of people should read this book  It gives great insight on a peaceful way to take control and thrive  It has taught me ways to cope with different situations in life   Jacob  Great book  and a must readIt is quite insightful on many levels    OJust one tip  read the book one rule at a time     No matter how engaged you are or how much free time you have Sound wisdom that stretches beyond the battlefield  marching on untarnished by time like a stainless steel suit of armor  There are people here who think this book isn t exciting enough and gave it a low score  And I quote  Uhh yeah this book isn t a page turner   These are the same kind of people that probably think twilight is gold and Da Vinci code is history     How ignorant and idiotic     A book which I keep coming back to Must Read  More than war  applies to every endeaver  Full of daily wisdom    Along with The Prince  one the classical foundational texts of leadership   i have to read this again  again and again    ktb lltrykh    Works brilliantly as a guide for playing Magic  The Gathering strangely enough  I actually read a different translation that I can t find on this site  gudda gudda such incredible knowledge from long agao brilliant  about war but also about life even lil bit hard to remember the names  it s just wow  combination between strategy  psychology  and lesson of life  just breath taking Althkugh it 2500 years old book  This is the master key for strategy of all time   The eastern cousin of  THE PRINCE Much more interesting than my strategy text book  I will always camp my men on dry hard ground with the hill to our right and the sun in our faces     I don t plan on taking over the world  and I doubt Sun Tzu wrote this as a treatise for would be super villains  but any armchair despot would be hard pressed to not have this book in thier bathroom next to their toilet  where we all read and you know it   I would rank this book much higher than Machievelli s Prince only because there is a much higher sense of honor inherent in Tzu s principles  Much of what is taught in this book can be applied to more than mere boardroom politics    I ve used it in Call of Duty 3   so there  Wisdom  diplomacy  tactics  ideas  maneuvers  War at home  war on foreign soil  Fair means  unfair means  It has it all  Old as the hills and relevant  to every country s defense strategy  as breathing  The best book I ve ever read  Legend Before Sun Tzu  tactical warfare was a heavily studied but infantile concept  Traditional strategists exploited the enemies  weaknesses as a means to victory  an important  but incomplete focus  Sun Tzu builds on this idea by teaching how the wise leader begins their conquest by first mastering themselves  their emotions and acknowledging warfare as a struggle against both foreign and internal opposition  Applicable even today for the average person  uses can be found in the mini battles of jobs  school  relationships  etc  Intentional or not  Sun Tzu s work transcends its original purpose and is an excellent read for all aspiring warlords   Enjoying        I found this book has many practicle components that you can apply to every day life  The Art of WarSun TzuSun Tzu or the Art of War as it is called in the western hemisphere  is a collection of ancient military wisdom from the minds of many great Chinese military leaders 23 000 years ago  Sun Tzu  an ancient military patriarch himself  is responsible for bringing these stategical texts together  To this day The Art of War is being used around the world not just on a military standpoint  It stands as a handbook for successful entrepreneurs  competitive businesses  athletes aswell as a required reading for several military squadrons  The art of war teaches that no victory comes from fighting a battle when not knowing and respecting both yourself and your enemy  That strength and greed win a battle while patience and percission wins a thousands Clayton Dowdell6th Period Great knowledge in this book  Really gets one thinking about how to solve conflict  Changed my outlook on how war actually works  It changed my opinion of the human nature  I should have read this a long time ago  Acabo de terminar el audiolibro y me ha parecido genial  Es totalmente logico y practico  Lo friamente que explica los procesos de la guerra pone los pelos de punta  Muy corto y directo  pero muy informativo e interesante  Very good read  recommended to anyone interested in military or business   Best book ever awesome for strategic management enthusiasts Art of War e kniia koiato vseki triabva da prochete pone po vedn zh na godina  Tova e kniga  koiato promenia znachenieto si s promenite  koito nst pvat v v vas  never dying  Without doubt  this is one of the best books ever written in the history of human civilization  The Art of War by Sun Tzu was a collection of 13  chapters  on how a militia should be run  including strategies and tactics  in ancient China  circa  Ch i state  Sun Tzu recorded the way that a militia should be run and perceived for his time period  along with the five governing factors of war  The Moral Law  Heaven  Earth  the Commander  and lastly method and discipline  Each a specific role in the way the Imperial militia was run along with all militia soldiers in China  Though none of the information was fully one sided or bias it shows subtle hints of influence directly from Sun Tzu himself that he gathered from his own experiences  and those he determined that worked best in all scenarios  The  chapters  of Sun Tzu were  for their time  considered a complete recollection of all things pertaining to war and war efforts  Although now it could be argued that the ideals of war tactics have changed and updated  if you will  to modern era  Even though we see some of the same ideas from Tzu s complete chapters implemented into our own war efforts today   Tzu was known for being a well organized man on and off the battle field  thus is expected from a war general of the Imperial Court of Emperor Ho Lu of Wu  Seeing the same tactics and grouping in his writings would be accepted  as was shown through the  chapters  of his experiences  His arguments are sound  not only verbally but tangibly when he put his methods to action with his own soldiers and even women to prove that the methods of warfare were universal  The writing style is very formal and  for lack of better terms  frigid  Giving it the well written standpoint of a man who has been educated and lived  most likely  in the upper class of his time  Though it is expected to have more of a vivid depiction of his encounters instead of the frosted tone given to the writings of a man who lived on the battle field  none the less the writings were incredible insightful and well thought out   Many others have opinions as to how war should be approached  therefore it could be assumed that many could have written valid and impressive arguments to a well written piece but such is the endless opinion of man  Thus it could be said by many  that it may have been better off that a number of persons had written the approach to warfare of the course of our ever evolving history and change in society and ideas  The most striking part of these recollections would  in a biased opinion  be  The Use of Spies   This is a detailed chapter of how using the men of a particular regiment  and installing them across enemy lines  can be extremely beneficial in gaining access to information that otherwise would have been lost to you  and more than likely  be the downfall for the surprised platoon on the battlefield  Resulting in a resounding defeat   Anyone with interest in strategy tactics  whether it is strategy in a game  military  politics  personal relationships  or management of any kind  can get a precious view point on how to deal with different situations  In general  the parallels one can draw with the overall philosophy inspired by the book makes this a quick  yet valuable read  Surprisingly relevant  even to a modern day Christian civilian in the relatively peaceful USA  As Paul says   We are born into a world at war   This book is definitely worth the 50 page read   Such wisdom Deep  Buen libro de estrategia con consejos que son aplicables en diferentes ambitos de la vida  no solo en la guerra  This is the man who said the famous words  or wrote them  something like   The first rule of war is to know your enemy  The second rule is to know yourself  Anyway  I read this book many years ago  cover to cover  and I was amazed at his practical wisdom and thinking  This book is as much a book of philosophy and a study in human behavior  as it is a book of how to conduct war I have to say  though  that if you ever want to defeat another person  read this book  This will provide you with much warfare butt

when it first came out and still to this day I have it resting on my shelf  Now I might actually read it again  it s so applicable that I can see myself applying it to law  great There s a reason why this piece of literature endured the test of time  Life is a battlefield and the Art of War provides the most profound strategies  When I was younger  after getting into a tough fight  not a figurative one by the way   my father told me to say nothing and wrote the book s name in a piece of paper  That was the best piece of advice he could ever have given An extraordinary piece of advice to keep in mind before entering any kind of battle  Saya membaca buku ini waktu belajar di kelas   Strategi dan Tata Kelola Strategis   Ketika belajar teori strategi memakai strategi Sun Tzu  saya sebenarnya agak bingung karena menurut Sun Tzu  Kemenangan dalam perang dapat diraih tanpa perang  Jadi Sun Tzu menyarankan agar perang sebagai  alat  terakhir untuk mengalahkan musuh  Sun Tzu menjunjung tinggi sekali  wisdom   makanya Sun Tzu tidak mau ada orang lain menjadi korban pwrang  Makanya Sun Tzu menciptakan beberapa keyword perang  yaitu deception  intellegence  the commander  dan context of war  Yang intinya  semua cara tersebut dilakukan agar perang sesungguhnya  bunuh bunuhan  tidak terjadi Sun Tzu berpendapat  perang akan menang jika memiliki jenderal yang cakap  Makanya salah satu tumpuan teori strategi perang Sun Tzu adalah pada seorang jenderal  Itulah beberapa poin yang saya dapat dari mata kuliah jurusan Hubungan Internasional saya  Terima kasih dan salam global strategist  Advice for living  Bedside book to read every day  increible  ensena muchas cosas sobre administracion de empresas y enfrentarse a problemas cotidianos  A liittle hard to understand at first but if you keep at it  it gets easier  I read this at least once every year  The art of LIFE  is what it teaches  If I ever decide to start a war I have my how to book   Great book with some strong everlasting concepts  I love the concepts throughout the book  Made me re think strategies in all areas of my life  This is one of those books that can be applied to almost any part of any person s life  When I was younger I took a lot of my life lessons from this book and still find myself returning to it from time to time  Much of principles that Sun Tzu has laid out for strategies of war has much relevance in modern day business and sports  even relationships sometimes  Though the technology has become outdated since then  the underlying principles remain the same At times  however  you ll feel in direct disagreement with Sun Tzu wrt some of his principles  But remember  this book was written for war  to create win lose situations  whereas  modern day conflicts are mostly best solved by win win solutions  So cut him some slack   The Art of War by Sun Tzu is a military science novel about all the tactics  regulations  and the art of war  This book is broken down into 13 different sections of war that s all interconnected with each other  giving a general a guideline to lead by  This book gets into the specifics of each part of war  with every potential outcome and how to react to this outcome  The Art of War goes far beyond just war  It touches on economics and business along with the ability to relate the material to many different things in everyday life   There are many things I like about this book  One thing I like about this book is that it s concrete and straightforward  This book covers almost all bases of war with each rule that s numbered through every section  It goes into extreme detail  even at times explaining every possible outcome of using fire in warfare and how to precede after  Another thing I enjoyed about this book was that it forces the reader to think critically  This book being only 126 pages caused me to think more than reading a 500 page book by far  I had to dig deeper with every statement made by Sun Tzu and left me in awe when he said things like  you can only be defeated if you allow yourself to be defeated  This book allowed me to apply these principals and rules to everyday life along with other professions  There weren t many things I didn t enjoy about this book but one of these things were that at times the book became repetitive  As I read further into the book I notice things that were previously stated already made an unwelcomed return  I understand that everything is supposed to be connected but when I read something that have been stated it causes me to question the intellectual value of the book  Another thing I disliked was that at times the rules lacked clarity  It seemed that some statements weren t modernized or were still stated like it was from thousands of years ago  Despite of being repetitive or unclear at times  I would highly recommend The Art of War  The great detail made this book well rounded  causing it to be very beneficial  Since it was so beneficial I had to keep reading  attempting to become a well rounded individual like the book  Anyone interested in the military or just learning would love this book  This book is influential for many people and will continue to influence people for the rest of time  This is a timeless classic and a must read for any human being  Changes your worldview   just an amazingg book love it REREADStill great  Not that I was in any doubt  One word for this book  SMART Sun Tzu teaches us about how to make a strategy to win the every battle of life  This book  featuring Sun Tzu s words along with extensive commentary  provides advice not only for warfare  but problem solving and life in general  Excellent read for anyone interested in strategy  military or otherwise  This book doesn t teach to to create war I think it teaches you how to live your life and be a winner  Great nightstand material  My usual book choices are of the thriller horror fantasy persuasion  so this was considerably out of my comfort zone  The Art of War is a short yet incredible book written in 5th century BC  Its age does not make its content irrelevant  as the interpretation of the book can be abstracted from specifics about military war to conflict in general  everyday life  The premise of the book is to rather  subdue the enemy without fighting   but if you must fight  you need to  know the enemy and know yourself  and develop strategies in order to secure victory   Un classico imperdibile Tutti dovrebbero leggerlo almeno una volta Ho questo libro anche nel formato cartaceo ma lo leggo volentieri anche in digitale  alcune parti mi sono rimaste nella mente perche infondo  L arte della guerra  e una rivisitazione della vita in chiave militaresca  That war  women    sales use the same tactics   strategies  Liked the part on manuevaring and tacticality The Art of War is a fantastic book  Sun Tzu s teachings are as relevant today as they were thousands of years ago  The book gives a set of instructions  rules  and tips on how to lead in war  However  this book can also be read in regards of businessmanship  While corporate competition is far less bloody than war  in most circumstances   both battles can carry a heavy price  This book teaches invaluable lessons in leadership  self control  and tactical ambition  A truly great read   ktb qym jd fy lstyrtyjy  l skry  wdr  lHrbllfylswf lSyny Sn tzw

the lessons of Sun Tzu may be  they are still relevant today and we have much to learn about the ruthlessness of truism and reality  must read  Sun Tzu has been my mentor for years   Even now  I still re read his book  His advice is not only for war but for business as well  Read it thoroughly and apply its concepts to your life and you will achieve your success   Amazing how this guy knew almost everything about strategy  and the guy wrote back in the VI bC   Do not move unless there is a real advantage to be gained  Once applied to business situations  Sun Tzu s classic handbook has helped me succeed in the most complicated situations  There s really not much to say  The lessons and advice of The Art of War are so brilliant and simply stated that they seem self evident  This book is like the number zero or washing your hands before surgery  It s difficult to imagine the world before this work  Good book and good rules put in a beautiful way   but i m not quite sure how we gonna apply this in the nowadays   The guideline for the soul of strategy  I got this on a Playaway from the library  I listened to it twice before returning it  I loved it  and would recommend it to anyone going into the business world   book of political strategy  how to make your enemies weakness your strength  How to position yourself how to gain information how to distract  how to create spies  double spies and to treat your soldiers   I love learning about cultures  I m not a fan or advocate of war  but a lot of what is depicted in The Art of War goes beyond that of common strategies for winning battle  Many of the philosophies by Sun Tzu can be overlapped into all aspects of human behavior singularly as well as groups of individuals  The basic premise of the points can be applied to business and all forms of relationships  To know one person  their habits  can teach you about their thoughts  their desires and their goals  From an observation standpoint  you can learn how to work with people  how to listen to people and how to properly lead people  as well as yourself I recommend this book to everyone  Be open to the concepts and look deeper at what Sun Tzu is describing to make it applicable to your life  Aidan Gillen s narration of Sun Tzu s classic is well done  Sure  we know him as Petyr  Littlefinger  Baelish on HBO s GAME OF THRONES    but even distancing him from that role  his ability to read this classic work is both approachable while also feeling like it s being read by someone who knows exactly what he s talking about  In a way  we listen to the philosophy of combat and warfare from the perfect man  he whom portrays a character that would likely have read this work and taken it to heart  Iki bin yil gecse de bazi seyler hic degismemis  Sun Tzu nun bilgeligi de onlardan biri  A classic  Main thoughts to take away is that war should be a means to a political end and it s best to win without having to fight  Should be read together with The Book of Five Rings  Excellent book  very general  as is expected for something which is learned by experience  but at the same time opens ones eyes to many things that would otherwise have been invisible to them until too late  The translation is good  though it needs another edit  and there are words with parts of them missing from the print  But nonetheless the quality of the foreword and the bibliography is rather priceless  Sun Tzu is indeed a genius who s word is not to be taken lightly  I really enjoyed this book  I can see why it s been studied for thousands of years  It can still be relevant to today   I really enjoyed reading the art of war by sun tzu  It was an honest book that gave good advice not only on warfare  but also practical advice for an everyday basis  Many people use it for business law  and general tactics and strategies  The fact that so many influential leaders have used its strategies is a tribute to its honest ideas that are still very applicable today  It was also a very engaging book to read  in part due to my interest in the military  Overall  it was a concise work with helpful  candid advice that was a joy to read about  As a natural course of my profession  ok  first profession   I have both studied  and periodically re read  The Art of War   Moreover  I have read different translations  and even explanatory versions which have relevant commentary infused This version is clean  very clean  and has Aiden Gillen   Little Finger  reading the work  There is no added explanation  it is simple  direct  and very to the point from the original work To that end  I give it 5 stars  But please take it into context  this is from someone who has a history with this work already  If you are a first time reader of  The Art of War   I do recommend getting an annotated version translation  which has the rich explanatory comments added Finally  simply to give compliments to where they are due  Aiden Gillen does an OUTSTANDING job of reading the very short work  This is a keeper  This is a book to return to  Despite its military angle  the book is filled with compassion  The aim of war is peace through victory  and slaughter is not the goal  czytalem nascie razy  nie ma takiego problemu  ktorego rozwiazanie nie znajdowalo sie w tej ksiazce  strategia uniwersalna A Arte da Guerra e um livro de estrategia militar classico que  em poucas paginas mas com extrema profundidade  evidencia os varios elementos que devem ser tidos em conta para se vencer uma batalha  Nao raras vezes  parei a leitura e fiquei a pensar nas palavras escritas  na ideia que refletiam  na forma como as podia aplicar aos meus dias  Vencer sem combater  esperar o inesperado  conhecermo nos a nos e aos outros sao algumas das ideias que Sun Tzu explora  entre tantas outras de valor  que mais do que representarem formas de vencer uma guerra  sao pressupostos que podemos aplicar no nosso quotidiano sempre que enfrentamos problemas ou obstaculos  Entra para a minha lista de livros preferidos    This is the most interesting history book I have ever read  In this edition  it tells about the Art of War  in great detail  and the man that wrote it  Sun Tzu was conciderd a mighty warrior and a great philosipher  What made him famous though was the book he wrote over two thousand years ago  The Art of War is the most famous ancient chinese work that is used today  The Art of War is useful in both life and war  It s useful in any competition  whether it be warfare  politics  business  and sports  The book was written as a result of Sun Tzu taking command of an ancient chinese army in 500 B C  The original Art of War was written on thirteen vertical bambu strips  each about a foot long  consisting of just as many chapters  Every chapter in the Art of War pertains to every principle of warfare   This particular edition is translated by Ralph D  Sawyer  My personal favorit parts of the book would have to be the fisrt few chapters  Reason being they tell of the main ponits of what the Art of War is all about and they seem to be the most useful  My absolute favorit quot that Sun Tzu emphisizes is  Know your enamy and know yourself  and in 100 battles you will never be in peril   Required reading for anyone who wants to study strategy  not just in the military but in the civic political arena  If there are any other social justice campaigners out there who would like to discuss lessons learned and applicability of this book to our work  I m down  i love this book  it is a little hard to understand at first but once you have read it a couple of times you begin to understand what it is teaching you  i have also found its key ideas useful in certain real life experiances and i have used what i have learnt and put it to use

would recommend this book to anyone  Even if one is conscientiously oppposed to war  one can apply these strategies to a myriad of situations involving people  Awesome   keep on the  read again often  shelf  Wish this was required reading for our leaders and politicians   83 pages  A must read for all leaders This is a great book that every leader should read  It shows you aspects of confrontation that you would not normally think about and you can use these tactics in your every day life  A must read   This book started slow and I was trying to figure out why this is relevant in life and business   and amazingly as I went through it and got deeper and deeper  it really makes sense why some of the principles and  art s   of war are really a metaphor to a successful  art  of life and business  recommended and I see why people enjoy this and recommend it for purposes beyond what it was primarily written forWaseem Mirzahttp   www WaseemMirza net Although written by a war strategy mastermind as a guide   The Art of War  is a book I recommend to people who are lost in their own spiritual battle to get an insight as to what to do and how  Nastil na kniga dlia kozhnogo  khto

long time ago  but it stuck with me  The simplicity and clarity of thought changed the way I approached things in my own life  The message   Slow down  Think  Access  Determine  Then  when certain  attack  and the other  Know when to cut your losses  were new concepts for me  Thankfully  in the world of chaos I lived in as a child  I was able to apply these things as I made my way into adulthood  I still go back and read Sun Tzu from time to time  Not necessarily from cover to cover  but I open it and read a portion  It reminds me of how important it is to think before I act and for that  I am eternally grateful to a man and an ancient Chinese philosophy on war that can to this moment be applied to my every day my own life  Dostoinii pereklad  Ie sproba suchasnoyi interpretatsiyi v

situation in life we can learn a lot from Sun Tzu s insights  amazing  this book has really helped me alot  i dont what i d hv dont without it Um excelente livro para desenvolvimento pessoal que pode ser aplicado a diversas areas como negocios e estudos  Every manager must read it  This book should be required reading for everyone  It is pretty much a guide at how to win at life  That simple   Excellent piece of literature  Eloquent  insightful  and enlightening  Contrary to many people s ideas  it isn t really a step by step guide to war  but more about conflicts in life  I suppose it could be war too  it depends on how you read it   The interpolated excerpts from relevant classical Chinese commentators complement the translation  After reading this book I now understand why this is a business classic  Sun Tzu has something to teach the business professional and the military officer professional as well   My favorite chapter  the one about spies  I read this book when I was thirteen and I still love reading it  Unreal  Great book  I use this in my everyday business life    The Art of War  is not only helpful in wars and battles but also in daily life routine competitions  Like it or not we have to fight for every thing in life with a stranger or a known person if you master the art of war you can master the peace too   Amazing strategy for battle and life  To begin with  this is a great deal on Kindle  no charge  because the copyright expired hundred of years ago  Bless Mr Cleary who translated it  As a writer  I m delighted to read a  how to win battles  book  I know some things but can always learn more  If I was in any army  at any time  I d say would be a great way to educate command officers  I noticed Sun Tzu was mentioned in the only TV show I watch  so it has withstood the test of time   A list of heuristics  organized in categories  that provides an excellent framework for strategic thinking and decision making  Would also recommend  The Prince  to be read alongside this   I loved the book and its ideas  i think they still can be implement to understand and to learn especially for those who are studying politics or even business administration  amazing The Art of War is one of the great classics of any language  and this is an admirable translation that I ve enjoyed revisitng dozens of times since I first read it  It gives you a sense of the cutting edge of war centuries ago  cuts to basic human motivations  Further  Sun Tzu s advice can mostly be reapplied to the combative aspects of business meetings  arguments and conversations that we have every day  Supply  morale  high ground   it s all been re adapted for use in virtually every profession  Personally  I find his academic thought process calming  and will often return to this book when I need to escape irrational anger or fear  Even after all these centuries  Sun Tzu can put a person in the mental place where they can work in a few dozen pages  A strategy book based on the old Chinese concept of  war   The reader learns how to become the general of the forces of his life  Great for martial artists  but it could also be considered a self help book  Don t be misguided by its name  war is not simply the angered  thoughtless and violent engagement of two oposing forces  but the calculated  well thought  balanced and intelligent avoidance of violence to achieve victory when resolving matters of great importance  Clearly a classic  Para quem ja leu o classico A arte da Guerra e sabe a importancia historica do texto  vai gostar dessa edicao feita pela Martins Fontes que vem recheada de informacoes na introducao e comentarios ao longo dos capitulos  o que e de grande importancia pra livros do tipo ja que nao basta uma simples leitura do que esta escrito nos capitulos  tem que ser lido com a conjuntura no qual ele foi composto  e o diferencial dessa versao e trazer mais informacoes que ainda nao tinha visto  completamendo em outras edicoes  e e claro  tras tambem um livro extra feito por um descendente de Sun Tzu  E uma leitura bem tecnica com interpretacoes que ajudam a dar leveza  a carregada frieza e inumeros conflitos daquele tempo  Glad I gave this another try  The free Kindle download was impossible   Sun Tzu s actual text all mixed up with endlessly boring commentary  But the book itself kept all the commentary in the back  where it belonged  So much great stuff in here  As I read it  it really brought together all the history books I ve read on the Civil War  the Revolutionary War  etc  and made sense of it all  I can see why this is still required reading in military academies across the globe  Brilliant stuff  And as my husband pointed out  it really does apply in business settings as well  anywhere good leadership is important  A must read   Helped me out on the yard against Security Threat Groups  A great book  one of the few whom everyone should read at least once  I do it once per year  Amazing Give or take a few thousand years and things that count haven t changed all that much  Wise words of the old general still ring true  although they sometimes leave a bitter after taste Maybe because they are stripped on any romanticism that more modern authors love to coat them in War is at its core a dirty business   This translation of Sun Tzu s epic work is brilliant  James Clavell has gathered historical examples of each of Sun Tzu s strategies  It brings a new dimension to this classic work  a little harder for me to translate into a guide for modern business strategy  but still interesting  I read it  Now I am re reading it  Maybe some of it will stick in my brain  I can see why this is a classic   a surprise  considering it s military strategy   I may have to go read more Churchill or some Roman stuff    If life is a war       then this book will surely help you to win certain battles          Foundational book for military history   The superior militarist foils enemies  plots  next best is to ruin their alliances  next after that is to attack their armed forces  worst is to besiege their cities    The Art of War by Sun Tzu Plan for what is difficult while it is easy  do what is great while it is small    The Way and it s Power It is the unemotional  reserved  calm  detached warrior who wins  not the hothead seeking vengeance and not the ambitious seeker of fortune    The Art of War A good merchant hides his treasures and appears to have nothing     Zen Buddhists Seeing what others do not see is called brilliance  knowing what others do not know is called genius  Brilliant geniuses win first    Masters of Huainan A military operation involves deception  Even though you are competent  appear incompetent  Though effective  appear ineffective

and the strong and the weak unite   this is because of the momentum  not the individuals     Du Mu The only way to ensure that opponents will not get to you is to harm what they care about     Zhang

and who advance aggressively are going to retreat     Master Sun If you are quiet and inconspicuous  others will not be able to figure you out     Mei Yaochen There are five kinds of fire attack

confusion so that you can attack them     Du Mu Dead spies are those who are fooled by their own leaders into passing on false information to the enemy  when the facts are determined  they are inevitably killed    Wang Xi Real classical Chinese wisdom  Wish I could understand more about it  This truly is a study on the art of war  The author has explored the subject meticulously and presents us with the important issues that must be dealt with during wartime  Many of those cannot really be used in our age  since war is not fought the way it used to be at the time the book was written  but other parts are very informative and important even now It is both disturbing and reassuring that this text exists   disturbing because people actually took time to study war  and reassuring for the same reason  They may have turned it into an art  but at least they know what they re doing  or at least they did    I had read it many years ago in French  This is a side by side translation with footnotes from the translator  Excellent read  I highly recommend this edition  Recommend it particularly if you want to keep it as a reference book and read it over and over again   For a 3 000 year old book  the writer was very intelligent  I liked the lessons to be taught in this book  Now I see why many bisnesses use it for help  Even though it was short  the lessons to be taught were timeless  This book isn t all about war  it was made for every day life and I thought that was the coolest thing about it  Sun Tzu  the author of  The Art of War   writes about many strategies used by the ancient Chinese military  This book is translated in most languages and is recommended reading for members of the armed forces  Many concepts in  The Art of War  are applicable today  and not just for military use  Many use the philosophies illustrated in  The Art of War  in daily life as well as business  One such principle is proper planning  This can be used in school  work  and in daily life  Sun Tzu lays out proper planning by saying  Therefore  in your deliberations  when seeking to determine the military conditions  let them be made the basis of a comparison  in this wise   when talking about military affairs  Sun Tzu also highlights the importance of tactical dispositions by saying   To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands  but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself   which can be interpreted to suit daily life  This quote especially pertains to the cutthroat business world where one must almost play a game of chess to traverse it successfully   I was Career Army  This was a  must read  for me and I loved it  Used his principles in two combat tour in Vietnam  What it means to devote yourself to a lifestyle and passion  Para se ler pelo resto da vida  Voce sempre ira enxergar cada uma de suas passagens de forma diferente a medida que vai evoluindo na vida  a masterpiece about military strategy  guerrilla warfare  deeply influenced mao zedong  ho chi min and red nepolion  an enlighten guidebook for every warrior   Interesting approach to life  Great read  The Art of War is  as far as I m considered  an absolute must read for anyone interested in winning in a conflict  There s a zine version available online  stripped of most of the commentary  at www tangledwilderness org  A masterpiece   I really enjoyed this book  So many ideas that can be applied in different situations  I think it depends on the translation  though   Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night  and when you move  fall like a thunderbolt   so short and concise   a few words by Sun Tzu are enough to make one understand fighting   Not just strategies for war    I think I ve read at the very least passages from this annually since I found it in elementary school  and I ve probably read various editions cover to cover two dozen times  It was the first book I downloaded from Project Gutenberg  Like most books of great wisdom far too many people quote from it who either haven t read it or choose to ignore its subtleties  ktb mmyz  shrt mqdmth l   n l skryyn wlqtSdyyn wlsysyyn

 For about 10 years i ve been meaning to read this book  but never got into it  A friend told me it would help me understand the rise of Donald Trump  and she was right  The art of war is not about war as much as it is about understanding people  If you are both excited and stunned by these political times we live in  you might want to give this book a try   The Art of War  in whichever translation you read it in  will show you just how advanced militaries from thousands of years ago were  Most impressive is the shrewd and expertly manipulative intelligence branches  Some of the tactics employed in their time rival what is done in this day and age  War  in a very realistic sense  is an art when looked at from high above  Treat your soldiers and armies as chess pieces and not as human life and you conquer  Seriously  this should be on the nightstand of everyone in gov t  Shortly after 9 11  if I picked this up and read a page  I would get depressed  because it seemed that the terrorists had read this and the Pentagon hadn t  It s not long  but every page is packed  It is eminently re readable  with more insights each time   and not just for fighting  as so many business advice books are probably based on it  qua sieu  12 thien ngan ma bao ham het nhung su loi hai cua viec dung binh  that kho nghi la 1 ca nhan o cai thoi sach vo con khan hiem tu cach day 2700

still like Macchiavelli better  It s the same simple  sincere and clear language again  that s great So  similar to The Prince indeed  superb  sarcastic  pragmatic  useful  unkind  I guess it fits school life just like it fits war  comes in handy in every kind of competition  Sun Tzu knew his stuff  Putting his advice to action requires great personality  sureness and leadership qualities  Nothing for weaklings  Well now im going to go kill as all the people i hate peace For everything in life  the strategies in this book are invaluable  Classic on Strategy  Period  qbl  n  tTrq lwSf

ve water to read this book for a long time because of its leadership implications  I am so glad I took the time to read it  Great parallel to leadership and management in the business world   I am not capable enough to review a masterpiece    A classic to re read again and again  Of all ancient books I would place as still very relevant  It is the art of war and even though this was written before Christ it should be and is taught in the world s military academies  It is so rare for a book to maintain its relevance   The Art of war is a book that illustrates military tactics  the book was written in BC so you can imagine the amount of age it has on it  The most amazing thing about it is how it has been used countless times by many military leaders  One famous quote that s also featured quiet a lot in history is  Appear weak when you are strong  and strong when you are weak    this tactic has been used countless times and has always worked  this shows that the book is obvious very popular for its correctness The book has many inspiring features the great thing about it is how the battle tactics used here can also be applied in the business world as well etc  An example being  If you know the enemy and know yourself  you need not fear the result of a hundred battles  If you know yourself but not the enemy  for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat  If you know neither the enemy nor yourself you will succumb in every battle  this can be applied in the working world because if you know what you opposition is aiming to achieve and you know what you have and want to achieve you can over come them and defeat them to that goal This book is recommended to anyone that wants to learn about ancient warfare styles or even what type of tactics work in the current world  Good  a must read for strategy  philosophy  applies far beyond a literal battlefield   The way this book is written is interesting and amazing even If a person doesn t like the subject and wat is written in the pages is very wise     Great book all the way around What a great guidebook   This is a stratagists bible  It is not just for winning wars  it is for life lessons as well  If really understood it can be used in any situation  I found it fascinating beyond the planning stages  all the way to the rules of life in general  I would recommend this to anyone interested in learning how to take charge of their muddled thinking  or things they feel are out of their control  Once we understand that we can only control how we react to situations only if we see the entire field ahead of us we are far better off  Emotions must be set aside  I love this book  I felt like such a novice reading this and knew I had to read it over and over again  Love this book  This translation is easier to understand than my Samuel B  Griffith 1963 translation  The book is divided into 3 parts  Sun Tzu s The Art of War  3 detailed discussions  including Taking Whole  my favorite   The Sage Commander and Joining the Tradition  and commentary on The Art of War by scholars  including other generals  of Sun Tzu s time and later  Recommend that you read The Art of War once and then read the 3 discussions before reading it again  It helps make sense of concepts like shih  nodes and Tao that are difficult for Westerners  like me  to understand  It s not necessary to read the commentary  which is not helpful for the most part Situations that continually shift and change from day to day are the ideal context for applying the principles of Sun Tzu  Read Sun Tzu patiently and thoroughly to help solve problems involving other people  in such situations  Even so  understanding it well enough to apply it comes only with perseverance and patience  You ll have to work at it  but the benefits are tangible  You ve probably read Moltke s saying   No campaign plan survives first contact with the enemy   which was influenced by Clausewitz  I compare Moltke s saying to project plans within modern government or business settings  Sun Tzu will help you see  anticipate and deal with all of the setbacks and so on that arise in the face of any such project Whatever has attracted you to Sun Tzu s The Art of War  you crave both a deeper and a broader understanding of the often hidden meanings in this little book  No doubt  you want to know how these passages apply to the daily and lifelong challenges in the wide world about you  The Denma Translation provides a thorough discussion  in Taking Whole  of shih and node  as in drawing the bow and releasing the arrow  as well as Tao  In The Sage Commander  you can begin to learn the personal traits you must develop to apply Sun Tzu s principles  You already realize that you ll be studying Sun Tzu for the rest of your life  You ll come back to this little book again and again on that journey  An Eye opener  ancient wisdom applied to modern circumstances  There is little work on warfare and conflict so pivotal as the collected treatise of Sun Tzu  What you will find is this book are battle tactics  the mentality of a king  And yet there is a powerful reverence for life and a set of guidelines for a leader to rule any country well  A must read for any person who fights for a goal   Have you ever read a book which was written more than 2000 years ago  I have   The Art of War  is a 2500 year old book written by Sun Tzu  a famous Chinese general and a great philosopher  He is one of the best warlords ever  his philosophical texts are well known all over the world  Many other commanders used Sun Tzu s philosophy to succeed in battles   The Art of War  has a unique structure  It does not have any plot and there are no characters  The book is composed of 13 chapters  There is not any coherence between these chapters  each one is a separate statement  The main concept of Sun Tzu s philosophy is that it s better not to fight than to be involved in a conflict  but if you are going to have to fight  then you have to do it to win  Sun Tzu mentions various strategies  often brutal  that will bring you to that result  In the chapters Sun Tzu shows us the strategies to succeed  and the fruition of these strategies is just the art of war  The book is a bunch of tips  And by following those tips you can reach success in any realm  I can prove it by bringing some examples   The Art of War  is listed on the Marine Corps Professional Reading Program  It is recommended reading for all United States Military Intelligence personnel and is required reading for all CIA officers  Many Japanese companies make the book required reading for their key executives  The book is also popular among Western business management  who have turned to it for inspiration and advice on how to succeed in competitive business situations  One of the main values of the book is its quotes  Each line of the book is a separate quote full of deep philosophy  And some of them are very illustrious  for example   The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting   My favorite quote is  Even the finest sword plunged into salt water will eventually rust    I think  The Art of War  is a  must read  book for every person  especially for the future businessmen  Maybe you can t find a book that s expressing its ideas and whole philosophy of the writer as  The Art of War   great leadership advisory  If you lead  or aspire to lead  and want to succeed doing so  read this book  Tactics and theory which hold up through the centuries will benefit you  i read it for fun  i liked it and it mostly talked about the strategy of war timeless  Sono rimasto impressionatoI punti sono molto utili  spiegati in modo chiaro It s a secret    Fascinating read  As I am obviously not planning to go to war etc   for me the book was useful in training my logical thinking  teaching me the importance of taking notice of every little detail and a few things about honor  Definitely deserves a re read  This book is very militaristic but i don t necessarily think it can be only applied to military and war  I think that the things in this book could help someone mentally prepare for some sort of competition particularly in some sort of sport I think the authors purpose in writing this novel was to educate people about the strategies of war  I say this because throughout the book it constantly gives accounts of how the strategies and different ideas were demonstrated in many battle situations  This book is basically a manual for war  It talks about all the different strategies and tactics and everything essential to a military  It goes on to talk about how to go about certain thing like maneuvering one forces to how soldiers should be treated  Overall I liked the book and i recommend it   Best quote   When the world is on peace  a knigth d have his sword behind his arm  You read this once and you start to notice little things around you  read it twice your eyes open to new ways of looking at things  keep reading it through your life and a new way of living happens  Life is a personal war with events and this book helps you choose the right battle to enter  and the right time to retreat   Great inspirational book  Various quotes will overlap with every day life  work life  personal life  strife  grief and joy   great book dMade me want to watch Mulan    but I don t think I ll view it the same way ever again  Great readidn t take long  I will probably apply this toayyyyy Good book What    Don t tell me you haven t read this  Astonishingly up to date description of battle  power  ambition and all that stuff  Sun Tsu reveals us things that are totally forgotten by 22nd century men  Highly recommended  Wonderful book with lessons that can be applied to war  martial arts  and life in general  Since this is now my 6th time reading this book I can no longer be trusted  according to Thai custom at least   Just classic  Must read  khms njwm ln shkhS mndh zmn b yd bdwn

said  2500 years after it was written and still is a leading reference in strategy    and will likely continue to be  A fundamental piece of literature which can be applied not only to war  but to other aspects of life as well  The best translation     Excelente libro     Un libro interesante que te ensena a mirar la vida desde la perspectiva de la paciencia y la perseverancia  I love this book and have several versions  Um livro de grande sabedoria com excelentes conselhos que metaforicamente se podem transpor para a realidade de hoje em dia  A perfect Cliff Note version of The Art of War which everyone should read no matter your status in life  What can you say  It s Sun Tzu  It s still pretty good the 20th time around  Could be applied onto a lot of things in our lives  Great book  The premises and lessons are universal  can be used as a tactical and moral guide to army generals all over the globe  Also  I love the fact that you  an Army of yourself  can learn how to deal with conflict  war    A true classic to be read again and again  While it is a quick read  much is to be gleaned from it through careful reflection  One of the true enduring classics of human literature  Written in China or what was in the process of becoming China  over 2000 years ago it is one of the few books that not only hasn t lost it s relevance over the ages it has in my opinion only gained  Sadly  it gets overlooked by many people because they hear about itand they think  I m not in the military and never plan to be so what use is it to me   Yes primarily it s purpose is to teach how to fight and win military conflicts but it goes much much deeper than that  If you desire accomplishment in any field  business sports politics you name it then this book can help you in some way to attain your goal  This book  although written in snippets of knowledge  more like a series of quotes than an essay or a book  is extremely beneficial in so many ways  Although the language and references are a bit outdated  the theories and observations still apply  And even though  this book is soundly used for military use  it applies itself readily to any situation and can be used as a wonderful self help book  not because it gives affirmation to your existence or it makes you feel all fuzzy inside or tells you that all your dreams will come true  it s a self help book because it draws metaphors for all facets of existence and gives logical and concise strategies for overcoming obstacles  Must read  ia vvazhaiu  Bukval no prokovtnula knizhku  Dopomozhe trokhi zrozumiti Skhid i ne til ki Bagato chogo mozhna interpretuvati na suchasnii lad  shcho Sergiiu Lesniaku  razom z ukrayins kim perekladom  vdalosia dovoli dobre  Chitaite  Got to know about this when I was still in high school  I read it sometimes in college  Now I m thinking to read it again  A must read book this is  I plan to take over the world someday  this will help Obviously a classic  I can think of quite of few people who either never read this book or thought they were smarter than the master  Good for everything from politics  which end up being everything  to your every day life   So the important thing in a military operation is victory  not persistence  Simply awesome  Classic read on maneuvering through conflict   If you have not read this book  stop  There s a great chance your life is currently being controlled by someone who read it  If you have read this book  stop  You should know by now your life could be currently controlled by someone who dug more on it than you did The Art of War is not a book about victory  it s the ultimate treatise of the nature of conflict and on how the conduction of the efforts to solve a conflict could transcend victory  Everyone can win  from time to time  if they fight hard  To win without moving a single feather is the true victory  The most respected general does not wage war to win  he has won before it even began  lktb kthr mn ry   Sun Tzu s wisdom covers much more than just some basic principles of military discipline  Whether you are an entrepreneur  a student or you are just fighting for yourself  every sentence in this book is a valuable hint that you may want to frame and put on your wall  Highly recommended  One of my two favorite books  Eu so li duas traducoes deste livro  mas esta e bem melhor que a outra  The Art of War is basic reading among soldiers  In my case  I need to return to it every so often  The teachings about developing a sense of military leadership apply as appropriately to operations other than war civil military operations and other peaceful military pursuits  This is because military strategy s not all about overpowering the enemy in the physical sense  It s also about evoking the kind of wiliness that will make the belligerent forces lay their arms down and take to the negotiating table  Clever  deep  and the best thing I had ever read as a child  This is an interesting book that reveals ancient Japanese tactics that are still used today  Un libro basico de estrategia  tanto para los negocios como para la vida cotidiana  Es bueno saber como tratar a los  enemigos   As usual  the Asian philosophy makes the Western one look like a child play  This is not exactly a book about the meaning of life and the nature of the world  yet somehow   it kind of is  It is about attitude and perhaps that is what life is about finding the right kind of attitude  Even if you see it as only an ancient Chinese military treatise  it s really something  I was reading a summary of this book for my university so i decided to read the whole thing since its just 160 pages  It was so worth it   This book is great   Sun Tzu is the master of the art of war   Brilliant  This is not really a book that you finish reading  You think about it all the time and you keep seeing examples of what he means in everyday situations  Aplica para cualquier  guerra   Conoce tu entorno  conocete a ti  conoce a tu enemigo  Impresionante lo actual que puede ser  La confusion aparente es producto del orden  la cobardia aparente  del valor  la debilidad aparente  de la fuerza  The beating heart of all military strategy  The Art of War is a strategic military masterpiece that is literally timeless and universal in it s application   No wonder military leaders still refer to this book  the logic behind how to prepare troops  how to invade  how and what to pillage still rings true today  The logic can be applied to the business world as well  Certainly one of the best books I have read so far The  rules     or pieces of advice    displayed by Sun Tzu in The Art of War are written in a simple way  but each of them should be analyzed over and over again to understand the depth of his thoughts More than that  The Art of War is not reserved for people studying the military field  The book can be useful in any profession  in our everyday life  or even for games video games  Being a chess player  I use it to improve my strategies and tactics    and the result is satisfying Overall  The Art of War is one of those books that should read at least once  even out of curiosity   Absolute classic of warfare Have read several times Some versions have too much commentary that ruins the simplicity My favorite version is in Roots of Strategy  Volume 1  http   www amazon com Roots Strategy     This is my 4th time reading The Art of War by Sun Tzu  and each time I find a NUGGET of wisdom   knowlegde that I apply to my everyday living  This is a book that everyone should read at least once   everyone  I was blown away by the pure lunacy and genius this book had to offer  I d find myself observing the tactics in the real world and having a  Sun Tzu  moment  The translators have done an amazing job capturing the essence of the power and language the author must have used  A must read  2000 years old and still just as applicable today  excellent Classic principles on how to view your situation from a tactical perspective  how to evaluate your position  improve your position and be victorious  constatly applied to the business world to evaluate your work  your competitors  your co workers from a tactical respective  a great master piece Makes you want to put on a suit and go take over something   This is not only useful in warfare but also in practical life  A good demonstration of the practical usage of psychology  I should have read this sooner  The amount of information I inherited from the traditional Chinese commentators is ridiculously high  I am going to apply what I learned from this book to my life  Everything I do  I ll be quoting Master Sun for a while  I apologize in advance to those who talk to me on a daily basis  I read this in one sitting  since it s relatively short  with and or without the commentary  I read without commentary first  then followed up with commentary  These guys seriously played to win  Survival techniques  strategic advice and war tactics  Why wouldn t I love this book  not a book  an experience   Really enjoy reading books like this  A classic  Lots of wisdom here   Wars are fought on many battlefields  I ve read so many quotes from this excellent book that it felt like re reading  Strategy and tactics are transferable into so many contexts that even if you have no interest military history or theory  this is well worth reading  The bottom line is that you should only fight if you are either certain of victory  or if you have no choice  Can t argue with that  Great for every day life  even if you aren t in the military  This book has significant influence on contemporary strategy and warfare  Such crafty strategies  especially in terms of espionage  are implemented drastically on modern days  The Art of War should be required reading in every high school  Sun Tzu demonstrates logical  simple  straight forward thought processes for decision making  His theories can be applied to everyday life and dealing with difficult situations not just war  I HIGHLY recommend this book  Aprende el camino del guerrero  La filosofia para vencer a todos tus enemigos en este libro de filosifia del guerrero que te impactara  Cada paso que damos ante un adversario o adversidad es esencial para vencer  y cada paso que da tu oponente sera usado en su contra  Excelente libro  altamente recomendable para los avidos lectores  I remember that I read The Art of War a long time ago  and I realize now that there really was a lot I didn t understand  First off  many people will tell you that this book is good to read for business  and in some respects it is  but if you try to put all of the lessons in this book about war in effect in business  then you ll be out on your ear in short order  This book does however give you a good idea of the things needed to do in any conflict  Know yourself and know your enemy  if possible use deceit and subterfuge as opposed to open conflict  These are very wise things to do  Moreover  these lessons will help you in business quite a bit  It also teaches that in whatever your field of battle may be  if you truly want to succeed  unfortunately  things like loyalty  trust  and honesty have very little place other than pawns in a morally bereft playing field  As in battle  in the fourth century B C   these things are true in business today  Be very careful about who you ally yourself with  and always be ready to change sides  I would like to think that things are different now  but recent events show me that they are not  Many of these lessons I will put into effect  n shyf n hdh lktb lmfrwD ySnf  l  nh m rf   m  w lys HSr  l  l skryyn fqTTb  lktb m rwf w byshkl jz mn trykh lstrtyjyt l lmy  fy lHrwb lkn yD lktb yqdr ys

realized that the words that came along with those works of art are more important  Every time my dad and brother  who both read the book  watched a war film  we always cite The Art of War as if the war film was based on the book  Ridiculous as it may seem  there s always a little The Art of War in every war film that s ever been made   But a kingdom that has been once been destroyed can never come again into being  nor can the dead be brought back to life   Great line  as so were many more in this wonderful work of thousand s of years ago  Required reading of our Leaders I would propose  if they have any intelligence  Dostoinaia kniga  Nesmotria na eio vozrast  ona aktual na i na segodniashnii den   Sovetuiu  Required reading while I was in the Army but an excellent book  I have read a number of versions and all are excellent  Sun Tzu boils the art of war down the basic bones of what to do and what not to do etc and most if not all of this applies to business as well   A great book for anyone wanting to understand conflict between people  also  if you liked this pick up The Mind and The Sword  this is a manual for life  keep it close  thank you  It was short but an interesting piece of literature  It helped me dwell into how a commander woukd think or how a soldier should be led  It was interesting to learn about of all the little things that can contribute to painting the art of war  The wisdom in this book is profound  A great read if only for the perspective from which it is written  I learned so much from this  Honestly  so much of this can be applied to every day life  Fascinating read  A great book whose truths extend to many facets of life  from business to personal conduct to life philosophy to competitive sports  Timeless   Hence  when able to attack  we must seem unable  when using our forces  we must seeminactive  when we are near  we must make the enemy believe we are far away  when far away  wemust make him believe we are near   Attack him where he is unprepared  appear where you are not expected   To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands  but the opportunity of defeating theenemy is provided by the enemy himself   To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength  to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharpsight  to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear   What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins  but excels in winning withease   Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend  march swiftly to places where you arenot expected   Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend  and he isskillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack    If we do not wish to fight  we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines ofour encampment be merely traced out on the ground  All we need do is to throw something odd andunaccountable in his way     How sly  and so on it goes maybe perpetually outshining all the war strategic books  I think   All warfare is based on deception Sun Tzu montou um guia rapido para generais de como conduzir seus exercitos  provavelmente transcrevendo todos preceitos orais conhecidos a sua epoca numa forma conveniente para consulta e lembranca posterior Com algumas maximas  seguidas de exemplos ilustrativos e praticos  ele mostra o que um general deve fazer e  principalmente  o que NAO deve fazer  para ser bem sucedido numa guerra O planejamento demorado  mas execucao rapida  Conhecimento de suas forcas e  em igual medida  das forcas do inimigo  O uso das condicoes dos homens e da natureza a seu favor e contra o inimigo  O papel da imprevisibilidade nos olhos do oponentes  A necessidade de saber alterar seus planos face aos planos do inimigo  A vantagem de se evitar o embate direto quando desnecessario  Sao partes dos preceitos basicos de Sun Tzu O que mais me espantou foi a sobriedade e a racionalidade dos preceitos  Sun Tzu parece nos dizer   Dado que voce tem de sobrepujar seu oponente  siga meus conselhos para fazer isso da forma mais eficiente e menos devastadora possivel   Uma moral fria  calculista transparece nos preceitos  mas essa frieza deliberada e assim de forma a maximizar as chances de vitoria e minimizar as perdas   um objetivo humano  em ultima instancia  Friamente humano  mas humano  Eu acho  pelo

about the tactics of war  and it is very very interesting  Some of the subjects that this book talks about is Spies  and Attacking with fire  For example   When fire breaks out inside the Enemy s camp  respond at once with an attack from without   Basically teaches you everything you ll need to know about battling  how to handle it  perhaps if the weather is bad  or the weapons you have compared to the enemyies  All of these are important  Personal favorite translated version  Read this with a Chinese app to go through the concepts again in Chinese  Timeless classic  fy lbdyh qyWmt lktb5njwm

literally waging war  this book  which reads very easy  goes well beyond that  It s not about  war  so much as  conflict   from classrooms to offices to relationships  It s about maneuvering through life s troubles  Yes  it s in the context of warfare  but so much of this book transcends literal fighting  It s probably the most helpful and meaningful nonfiction book I ve ever read  nSH y shkhS nh

integrated and enjoyed reading this type of books in the world of life this book is a must read    if you are searching    trying to reach for or just trying to get through you have to have your armor        must read  it s quick but still a staple for long term thinking  Everybody needs to read it  It s a cliche at this point because it s good  Invest in an annotated copy  though  Perfect collection of tactics and wisdom  These tactics and strategies continue to work to this day   and people in conflicts are still not learning from the past  My favorite book ever The detailed historical introduction by Ralph Sawyer was extremely helpful  allowing Sun Tzu s more terse  bullet pointish principles to make sense  Some favorites  One who knows when he can fight  and when he cannot fight  will be victorious   One who knows the enemy and knows himself will not be endangered in a hundred engagements    Those that excelled in warfare first made themselves unconquerable   The combat of the victorious is like the sudden release of a pent up torrent down a thousand fathom gorge   There are roads that are not followed   One committed to dying can be slain  One committed to living can be captured    The general  who is at first excessively brutal and then fears the masses is at the pinnacle of stupidity    Apply your awesomeness to the enemy   Anger can revert to happiness  annoyance can revert to joy  but a vanquished state cannot be revived  the dead cannot be brought back to life   This was not manditory reading when I was in the Air Force  but it was highly recommended As old as this book is  the leasons are pricelessIf you are in the military or Upper to Mid Management I encourage you to read this book  The Art of War is not the kind of book you would read cover to cover  You keep it on your desk and refer to it for whatever purpose  Sun Tsu s dictums are priceless and eternal  For example    If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the results of a hundred battles  This applies both to nations and individuals  Understanding and living this dictum separates the warrior from the common thug The preface is excellent  It provides a great overview of ancient Chinese military history  weaponry and politics Un clasico Mas alla de que se haya redactado como un manual para ejercer la guerra  hoy en dia se pueden tomar sus preceptos para salir avante en cualquier aspecto de la vida diaria Algunos diran que es solo una recopilacion de ideas muy logicas    Pero es mas que notoria la carencia de sentido comun en muchas de nuestras decisiones  Creo que ahi esta su utilidad  Great book   Somewhat of a pseudo catechism  in the vain of a military central Machiavellian political treatise  or rather  it s more likely the other way around  considering Sun Tzu wrote this quite a long time before Mach was around      Proper review forthcoming    Several years ago  the book seemed fine  nice and pithy advice on how to win a war  This time  however  I got a better understanding of the strategy  how war isn t waged on whim or reaction  It must be strategically engaged for victory  Sun Tzu s work deals less with how to  win a war   than how to practice the intelligence and insight to understand the enemy  take advantage of the entire lay of the land  and then proceed with caution and  when necessary  with swiftness  No wonder this ancient book is still taught in our military academies  Classic  In conflict  straightforward actions generally lead to engagement  surprising actions generally lead to victory    Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory  Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat   A classic book of military strategy with applications in your personal and work life   bqry                 It has ancient philosophy and strategy that can be applied to modern thinking and life  It offers selected perspectives from various warlords and men of knowledge in Chinese history  They each judge and advise on the conduct of battle and strategy  While some may only view the text as merely suggestions for actual war  it also imparts centuries old wisdom if one seeks it   A real good on strategy and warfare  Teaches great lessons that defy popular  and wrong  knownlege on war and victory and provides great insight in leadership and resource management  Much more interesting than I thought  I have to admit that I have not read any other translation edition from this classic  In any case  both this translated work and introductory essay from Mr Griffith are both superb  This is important  as a set of  quotes  it might be really hard to read without proper introduction  poor translation or poor foreknowledge on the subject  It is a 2500 years book  in Chinese  so pay attention to the translator Also  the Annexes are quite interesting  too My feeling is that this translation is quite closer to the original objectives and intention  It seems to me that Mr Griffith s military background is clearly put on the translation so to bring a new point of view beyond the usual translation from other renown sinologist  This is quite a nice feature  because it brings light to Sun Tzu verses that might be kept obscure otherwise  Also  it makes it more amiable Probably this fact makes the difference between this and other editions translations  Therefore  this 5 star goes for both the disputed Chinese author and the translator As for the content itself  surely one can wonder how such simple compilation of common sense can be regarded as a master work  To answer this  one should ask another question  how is that along 2500 years we have been and are suffering from misery  pain and distress due to ill lead governments and wars of carnage  And how many more we should expect from the future   I think that many people miss the point that for Sun Tzu the war is a really bad thing to happen  It causes pain and misery to the people and may bring ruin to the state  It is a serious thing to consider  so the superb general is that who wins without actually fighting It is not a  militaristic  book  It is just common sense applied to something nasty  but unavoidable  war  Some of the great quotes are in this book  All is fair in love and war  Keep your friends close  and your enemies closer I also really like  Appear weak when you are strong  and strong when you are weak   I remember when I first read it about 6 years ago  my first thought was that I had read this book way too late  and that I could ve probably handled many personal and professional difficulties in a much better way had I come across it sooner in my life The book is not just about war as an armed conflict  Most of its ideas and principles are applicable to daily life  relations and interactions with others  It provides an interesting and insightful perspective on life as a  war   as it really is in many ways  I would like to preface this review by saying that I read the translation by Samuel Griffin  with a foreward by BH Liddell Hart  There are quite a few translations of this work  so I thought I should clarify  This is the only version I have read  so I can not compare it to other versions  but I did enjoy the foreword and additional notes  as well as the commentaries by other scholars I will admit that if I read only the Art of War  without the commentaries  my understanding of some of the phrases would be a bit muddled as Sun Tzu was sometimes very brief in his ideas  so having additional commentaries and some examples helped to illuminate the text  I also took the time to read the additional biographies  and the effects of Sun Tzu s work on Japanese military thought  so I will say that the version I read was rather illuminating  Some people wouldn t care for the extra stuff  but I found it helpful as an expansion on the original text And what of the original text itself  Sun Tzu was quite correct in many aspects  and his wisdom is practical not just on the battlefield  but in relationships and the business arena  so it s no wonder that this book is such a classic  ClassicI chose this book because it s one of the classic literary treasures in history  I like this book because it defines war and tactics well before the authors time  Not only is this a book on war  but it s tactics can be used in everyday life  I recommend this book to everyone  All warfare may be based on deception  but all books on warfare  tactics and scheming are based on this  It s brilliant  has stood the test of time  having  endorsements  from men such as Napoleon  Mao and reportedly General Giap  The majority of reviews will say the same verdict as I have  its brilliant  This translation also has many bonus anecdotes about Chinese warfare s greatest blunders and triumphs  If you want to buy only one book on tactics and strategy  this is all you will ever need  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED   Just brushing up on an old favorite  This ancient book of military strategy has been followed by military men and businessmen for thousands of years two notable ones being Generals MacArthur and Patton  This work is attributed to Sun Tzu  a high ranking general in China about 5 000 years ago  though several other strategists are also quoted  Master Sun believed that war was a necessary evil  and must be avoided whenever possible  He felt like capturing an army or city intact was far better than destroying it  His book outlines 13 chapters of military strategy  covering everything from morale  use of spies  to position and timing  This is a classic work that will no doubt never lose it s relevance  Classic ktb jmyl w mmt  I read this years ago when I was still playing Bandit Kings of Ancient China and Harpoon on a regular basis because I wanted to have a better understanding of war strategy  While I found the text of The Art of Warfare pretty good  I actually found the archaeological references in the back more interesting  probably why I was an anthropology major   I ended up buying a copy for my Dad as well  This book lays out the tactics that have been used for centuries to fight a winning battle  Learn to think like a General of a winning army  from business to politics and on to battle  Know your enemy as well as you know yourself  Best leadership book out there  Suggested to me by my brother  Well worth reading  Amazing book that is relevant to every aspect of war  Business can be war  opposing competition in sports can be war too  This book has many teachings that can be applied to any aspect where you face opposition   I haven t read any other editions of this classic  But I think that Giles  commentary adds a lot to Sun Tzu s wisdom  I wholeheartedly recommend this book  You ll have to read the book twice  First as strategy of war  Second as Strategy of Soul  This is by far one of the greatest books on strategy ever written  The author helps to break down the philosophy of warfare into multiple chapters  This book is still a required read for most military officers and is still read by many business men today  Aside from the military aspect of the book  its teachings can be used when dealing with issues in life  A rather short book but very knowledgeable at the same time  i want to read this book to improve my personality I read this in one of my asian philosophy courses  A very good book if you want to understand the military thought of historical Asia   Loved this  Take out  war  and put in any type of situation  trial  challenge  circumstance and it really is a good road map on how to handle life in so many ways  No wonder my husband loves this book so much  He mainly speaks in metaphors  but It s easy to understand   I recommend the book because sadly there is great wisdom in thhis approach in dealing with certain people or certain sectors of society  Luckily  I have experience that not every area of life needs this approach  I recommend reading for those times when one must heed these lessons   Thank you Eric for this recommendation  Why did I not read this sooner  Strategy  preparedness  deceit  cunning  and flexibility  all that is needed to succeed at any war we find ourselves in daily  This had to be written by a woman    My books is not this version  its the comic version by someone whom I ve forgotten  It is an enjoyable read  and its interesting to see how this book was and can be immplemented in real life  However  it does have its shortcomings in how technology had advanced and some of these concepts are now obsolete  but this was written some 2 500 years ago  so I guess that is excusable  For example  archers can be changed into the normal infantry  and strategies can be adapted  This is surprisingly also able to be adapted to the business world  but I m not sure how  Although I ve seen several books on it  Overall  everyone should read this classic  except those who can t read and nubcakes  strtyj  bHt  dmGh llh ynwr  lyh  lmZt  D  jbn  jd No good has ever come from prolonged warfare    I think not enough of our government officials have read this book  Bunch of morons   Exceptionally exquisite  a diverse and intense inspirational and strategical book of existence in war and various roles life  This book is an amazing read  It provides great insight into the things that should be considered when leading an army  If the world was facing a nuclear apocalypse and I could only save Five books to help the future survivors rebuilt humanity this would be one of the books  Observations on the fundamental nature of conflict  Application of some of the principles and axioms in this book have made me a better person  Or more effective anyway  A must read for anyone who lives     recommended by ben ferrell  classmate in student services class and conflict resolution class  gave presentations over topics and mentioned this book   almost as though it were written by a pacifist  the ne plus ultra of military theory in terms of abstraction  To Sun Tzu  war is not about winning the pride  but winning with minimum damage  It is always being emphasized that you don t have  even you better not  to be considered as well prepared team  You have to look as you don t know anything  but in fact you are the master of the whole war scenario  This is one point of Sun Tzu s  Art of War  There are plenty of strategies to be learned in this book  And fortunately  most of the theories could be used in real modern life  After reading this book  you will realized that all of the war strategies inside was intended to avoid bigger conflict and put yourself in vantage point  By this point of view  I also realized that basic ground of the whole strategies is as same as economic theory  Maybe that s why a lot of business school using this book for lecturing material   one of my absolute favorite books  a guide to life and leadership in the modern times The teachings of Sun Tzu have be handed down for thousands of years  Originally by word of mouth  his teachings have been collected into a treatise known as  The Art of War   The treatise is a great manual for anyone looking to conquer and or dominate their world  This is because it has been organized into thirteen different books  chapters   giving the reader the option to pick and choose what they want to learn about in their quest for domination  Because of this  it has been translated into several languages and has been used by politicians  businessmen  and CEOs throughout the world   I give this treatise a 5 out of 5 star rating as it is interesting and still relevant in today s society  thousands of years after its printing  The superb ability of the treatise to remain relevant throughout time shows how well Sun Tzu s logic and reasoning creates one of the best guides to controlling and dominating states  This is seen in the multiple versions and translations of the treatise throughout history that are still being printed today  The ability of the manual to transcend multiple facets of everyday life further solidifies its position as one of the best guides to controlling and dominating the world around you  nthyt mn qr  ktb fn lHrb   swn tzw   lktb  brh  n mjmw   nSy H wHkm qymh lqyd  ljywsh f   rD lm rk   sh rt  nn    rfh jmy an fh  m rwf lan wlkn  jz lktb  nh ktb  m 500

classic has never lost it flavor  I still read it a couple of times a year  An aggressive bed time story  and mentor  I have nothing but good to say about it  Be water my friends  Bruce Lee The techniques in this book are useful not only for war  but can be applied in your daily interactions with people in subtle ways  The greatest book on strategy ever written   This is the greatest book on strategy ever written  It is a short book but every time I revisit it I gain something from it  This can be applied to business and romances  Very interesting read  The FULL VERSION   Very very very good for all people from all walks of life  very relevant in todays world  An enemy can be defeated by intellect and not by brute force  deception  indirect attacks and preparation     What can I say  It s THE book on military strategy  You can use the lessons in the book if your the commanding general for thousands of troops or just playing a military stradegy game  You can also apply the lessons to problems outside of war  Economics  politics  and general everyday obsticles can be made simplier by aply the tactics of The Art of War  The art of war is common sense but it doesn t hurt to remind ourselves of how calculated we could be  Good book  Gn   n lt ryf qdm ktb lstrtyjyt lHrb w dr  lmjmw t lkbyr  mmkn tqrh kDbT f  ljysh w mdyr mdrs  w Htstfyd f  lHltyn  A must read for everyone  Wisdom is to be gleaned from near every page  Don t think about it as just a book on war   Don t want to join a military but this knowledge is very interesting Kind but firm  What s there to say  I enjoyed every bit  and felt as if it was the best  how to book  I ve ever read  I will definitely be re reading it again soon  I don t say that often   Excellent for learning how to operate in the world and win  for life is a series of battles then the big war will come  This book will teach you how to fight and win  Not a story  but like the Tao Te Ching a set of principles or rules for living that use imagery and metaphor to illustrate their point  A very enlightening book to be read and read again   Timeless  These maxims can be applied to many aspects of life  Everyone should read this book no matter who or what you are  Sadly  people do not  Just look at World War II   Cough  Cough  The French   Un tratado sobre el  sentido comun  de la estrategia hecho hace siglos  El arte de la guerra es un ejemplo de que hay cosas que aunque antiguas y con lenguaje sencillo no pierden vigencia ni profundidad  Buena inversion de tiempo  I read it once a year  just because      I just tell people I read this book to sound cool at bars  Back 2500 years ago  when The Art Of War was written by Sun Tzu  a military commander  in China  he was part of the most advanced and prosperous societies on the face of the planet  Let me put this in perspective  when the British Isles were still overrun by barbarians  and when the Roman Empire was not even on the map  it was only a very small republic  was this work on military tactics being written  Let me also put this in perspective  that very work is still to this day on the United States military s recommended reading list for officers  and was considered a bible by Douglas MacArthur and Napoleon Bonaparte  That is just how important Sun Tzu s writing is  2500 years later  It would just be nice if more people in charge of our militaries and countries today would read it too  for if they did  I would go as far as to bet that many of the largest conflicts and political disasters of the modern era would not have escalated to the extent that they so tragically did   The wise warrior avoids the battle   This line came as a surprise to me  It felt odd to find that the number one strategy presented was to avoid battle altogether  However  it later became clear to me that what Sun Tzu was trying to say  and what he wanted the message of his words to be was  avoid conflict at all costs  but conflict is an inevitable part of life  so when in conflict   fight to win  At first glance  and this was true at mine  I took this book to be a hardcore book on military tactics  which  to a certain extent  it is   and thought it to have no relevance outside the battlefield  However  and I am sure I can speak for all readers of The Art Of War  once completing this work  you realize and appreciate the significance of the cliche of life being a battlefield  for it truly is  The tactics detailed and presented throughout the course of The Art Of War can be applied to school  the office  the sports field  and many other aspects of daily life Many critics of The Art Of War lambast the proponents by saying that the book really doesn t have a place outside of the minds of people who occupy positions of power  while others state that the lessons taught are nothing more than common sense  Lessons and tactics like   Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy s resistance without fighting    So in war  the way is to avoid what is strong  and strike at what is weak   and  Let our plans be dark and impenetrable as night  and when you move  fall like a thunderbolt  may seem a bit esoteric and non applicable to daily life  and even obvious once you learn the meaning of them  However  I find this to be the true art of this work  which is to take an idea so complex  yet obvious at the same time  and give it context  Not just any context  but context that we can learn from  And  if we are to reserve this knowledge  these tactics to those who govern our lives  from parents to teachers  to top politicians  how are we meant to fight back  is that not the true art of war Before finding a copy of this book  I highly recommend finding a translation or version of the book that fits your needs and desires  The Art Of War was translated from a series of scrolls found on the side of a mountain  so  as you can imagine  there are many different translations  some of which put large emphasis oh historical exposition and less on the actual original texts  and others vice versa  It may take time  but this preliminary effort will definitely make your reading experience much more enjoyable Sun Tzu s The Art Of War is that special kind of book that has just as much importance as id did 2500 years ago  That is what makes it a classic  It is full of life lessons for literally anybody who wants to know how to get more of what they want in life  and less of what they don t  with the added perks of having a new armory of wise quotes  and the ability to examine all the enemies that life can throw at you through the mind of a seasoned commander  It is a very special book  Absorb and learn it  It will pay off in the long run  whether you think it will or not   If you know the enemy and know yourself  you need not fear the result of a hundred battles     Sun Tzu A must read for strategy minded people anywhere  Conflict is a part of life and all relationships  This book will empower you and provide you with additional understanding of what is going on around you  and give you techniques to help yourself and other reach your goals  Ideally with minimal escalation  The Art of War is an incredible book written by the amazing military general  strategist  and philosopher  Sun Tzu  This book is filled to the brim with memorable quotes but my favorite quote by far is  Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory  Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat   This book is a great read and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read all kinds of things you could apply to your life  8 redR 1 Some people might criticize this book for increasingly stating the obvious but  I still recommend it to everybody  Sun Tzu put a lot of things into perspective in The Art of War  It s usefulness over two thousand years after publication goes a long way to show how important this book is   Awesome  No other comments  Read yourself    This book will surely help you as you face daily life and the pursuit of your dreams and life ambitions  Relevant more than ever   The art of living  actually  The Art of War  although written centuries ago  holds timeless wisdom for anyone interested in leadership  business pursuits  or even relationships with others  Definitely worth reading  Buy your own copy so that you can underline  though  A must read book by far  Everything about strategy  As a martial artist this book was an invaluable insight into the interworkings of not only physical combat  but overall logical regimentation in order to achieve goals  which has been a driving force in my success as one  During the latter part of his musings I found myself occupied with many  Aha  moments  I coined a five word phrase while in the midst that goes  The stone is but unbroken  JPS  2009  this edition compiles Cleary s translations of Bing fa by Sun  Wu  Tzu  his descendant Sun  Bin  Tzu   previously published separately as  The Lost Art of War    Zhuge Liang and Liu Ji  previously published as  Mastering the Art of War   and his translation of an alternate  but fragmentary  manuscript of Sun Wu s titled  The Silver Sparrow Art of War  uncovered by Chinese archeologists in  72  All together a good value edition  Outstanding  A must read for all current and future leaders not only in the military  Quentin Covert said  The Art of War is a blend of Chinese tactics as well as the tactics of it s writer s village  the home of Sun Tzu  This book gives an adaptable and genaric view of war and tactics  useable on both the  battlefield and the meeting room   to summarize it would take to long as each chapter is like an entire story  simply writen in two or three pages  So I shall sumarize the first chapter  Sun Tzu said  There are five aspects of tactics  Nature  Earth  The Commander  The Moral law  and the Ruler  from these aspects come many genaric questions such as  Who s army is closer to the battle  who is stronger  therefore all warfare is based on deception  making the enemy beleive he is at an advantange when he is truly the one to lose  This book is recomended for those who love the Chinese  and those who want to get an edge on mental warfare  212 Pages ktb  kthr mn ry   fy ltkhTyT lstrtyjy     qDyt fyh  kthr mn shhr  qr h w   yd qr  kl fSl fyh  l  lrGm mn ny  nhy ktb D f SfHth fy ywm w lyl kl q d  fyh tdhkrny bmwqf mn ltrykh qr th fktbh jwrhllh yrHmk y  m tzw    El libro de estrategia por excelencia  Una obra para leer una y otra vez  Altamente recomendado  Sun TzuIntroduction  The Art of War was written approximately tow thousand five hundred years ago  still many world leaders read the book because of its useful tips in daily life and eventually war  Many leaders have read it including Chinese generals and US strategists  For hundreds of years it was reserved for only Generals and rulers  The book was originally written in horizontal wooden planks  The book is wonderful  I learned a ton of information and how to apply the teachings to daily life  for example  Know your enemy and know yourself and you can fight a hundred battles without disaster  Sun TZUThis quote expresses that you have to be confident and trust yourself to overcome obstacles Many professional athletes apply this teachings too  The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting  Sun TzuEvery time I read this quote I get inspired  this book is not only war  it says that fighting is always a loss and you loose supplies  words have a very powerful meaning too Conclusion This is a great book that everybody disserves to read and learn form a very wise person  it has a lot of lessons and inspirational quotes  A good book if you want to look at strategy in general  A meditation point for the necessity and foolishness of war  The principles are timeless  I took my time to complete this book to assimilate whatever I read  I swear  every word has been carefully chosen to express Sun Tzu s thoughts  The primary message is brutally simple  Do whatever you can to prevent a conflict and if you must get into one do whatever you can to end it asap in your favour  War must be fought for peace and nothing else  The first over was my attempt at being a little stronger in my approach on life  I recently re read the book in coming across one powerful yet paradoxical excerpt    The supreme art of was is to subdue the enemy without fighting    And I thought      Hmm no need for aggression or fighting about anything   to allow things to happen and pose no resistance    will eventually weaken any opposition     Reading it    Too deep a book  The Art of WarIf I need to write a review for this book  you have missed something along the way   This book is basically a manual for war strategy  it s very text book  Sun Tzu takes every possible situation and shows how you can be victorious
